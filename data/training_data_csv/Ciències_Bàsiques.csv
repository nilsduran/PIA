Which of the following would NOT be likely to produce hypernatremia?,Near drowning in salt water,Hyperglycemia,Diabetes Insipidus,Watery diarrhea,"Hypernatremia occurs when there is elevation of serum Na+ of > 146 mEq/L. It occurs under various circumstances which include excessive Na+ ingestion in absence of corresponding water ingestion, an inability to ingest water due to impairment in thirst mechanisms, unconsciousness or lack of water supply, and insufficient intake of water to keep up with water losses. Near drowning in salt water causes considerable intake of hypeonic salt solution either through swallowing or absorption through pulmonary membranes. Diabetes Insipidus is a result of faulty, or insufficient secretion of ADH (anti diuretic hormone). This leads to increased urinary output of dilute urine with subsequent excess water losses, leading to hyperosmolality of serum. Hyperglycemia, however, tends to decrease serum Na+ concentrations as water shifts from intracellular compaments into intravascular fluids in response to the hyperosmolar state of the serum. Watery diarrhea will produce excess water losses in excess of electrolytes, thus increasing serum Na+ concentration. Ref: Howard C., Berl T. (2009). Chapter 3.

Which among the following is TRUE regarding Golgi tendon organ?,Senses dynamic length of muscle,Involved in reciprocal innervation,Alpha motor neuron stimulation,Senses muscle tension,"he harder a muscle is stretched, the stronger is the reflex contraction. However, when the tension becomes great enough, contraction suddenly ceases and the muscle relaxes. This relaxation in response to strong stretch is called the inverse stretch reflex. The receptor for the inverse stretch reflex is in the Golgi tendon organ. This organ is the receptor for the inverse stretch reflex and consists of a netlike collection of knobby nerve endings among the fascicles of a tendon. The innervation is the Ib group of myelinated, rapidly conducting sensory nerve fibers. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 12.

Which law is applicable for surfactant action?,Laplace law,Charlie's law,Thames law,Charles law,"The low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence in the fluid lining the alveoli of surfactant, a lipid surface-tension-lowering agent. Surfactant is a mixture of di- palmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and pro- teins (If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. In spherical structures like the alveoli, the distending pressure equals two times the ten- sion divided by the radius (P = 2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. Sur- factant also helps to prevent pulmonary edema. It has been calculated that if it were not present, the unopposed surface tension in the alveoli would produce a 20 mm Hg force or- ing transudation of fluid from the blood into the alveoli.Ref: Ganong review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 597",A

Inhibits gastric juice secretion.
Inhibits gastric motility.
Causes contraction of pyloric sphincter.
Augments the potency of action of cholecystokinin on pancreatic secretion.",B
"At 20-degree centigrade atmospheric temperature, body reacts by",Cutaneous vasoconstriction,Shivering,|BMR,All of the above,"The core temperature of a human is regulated and stabilized primarily by the hypothalamus, a region of the brain linking the endocrine system to the nervous system, and more specifically by the anterior hypothalamic nucleus and the adjacent preoptic area regions of the hypothalamus. As core temperature varies from the set point, endocrine production initiates control mechanisms to increase or decrease energy production/dissipation as needed to return the temperature toward the set point.Cutaneous vasoconstriction -Aerioles carrying blood to superficial capillaries under the surface of the skin can shrink (constrict), thereby rerouting blood away from the skin and towards the warmer core of the body. This prevents blood from losing heat to the surroundings and also prevents the core temperature dropping fuher. This process is called vasoconstriction. Shivering - Muscles can also receive messages from the thermoregulatory center of the brain (the hypothalamus) to cause shivering. This increases heat production as respiration is an exothermic reaction in muscle cells. Shivering is more effective than exercise at producing heat because the animal (includes humans) remains still.BMR - basal metabolic rate - rate of metabolism; the minimal amount of energy expended by our body during rest.

All of the following is true regarding HIV virus except: March 2010,Belongs to the subgroup lentivirus,Double stranded DNA virus,Characterised by the presence of reverse transcriptase enzyme,Acts on CD4 cells,"Ans. B: Double stranded DNA virus HIV belongs to the lentivirus subgroup of the family retroviridae. HIV is a spherical, enveloped virus. The genome is diploid, composed of two identical single-stranded, positive sense RNA copies. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) like many other viruses, stores its genetic information as RNA rather than as DNA (most other living things use DNA). In association with viral RNA is the reverse transcriptase enzyme which is a characteristic feature of retroviruses. When HIV enters a human cell, it releases its RNA, and an enzyme called reverse transcriptase makes a DNA copy of the HIV RNA. The resulting HIV DNA is integrated into the infected cell's DNA. This process is the reverse of that used by human cells, which make an RNA copy of DNA. Thus, HIV is called a retrovirus, referring to the reversed (backward) process. Other RNA viruses (such as polio, influenza, or measles), unlike retroviruses, do not make DNA copies after they invade cells. They simply make RNA copies of their original RNA. Some types of white blood cells called CD4+ lymphocytes HIV is highly mutable virus, unlike HTLV.",B

Acute IM is characterized by a VCA-IgM titer, and no VCA-IgG antibody or EBNA. Chronic EBV disease causes elevated VCA-IgG titers as well as high EA antibody titers.",A

In a normal adult sitting with eyes closed EEG will show,Alpha,Beta,Theta,Delta,"Ans. a (Alpha) (Ref. Ganong Physiology 22nd/pg. Chapter 11, Fig. 11-8).In a normal adult sitting with eyes closed EEG will show alpha waves. EEG with eyes open & mind wandering shows Beta waves.EEG wavesKey FactsAlpha# Happen between 8 and 13 times per second, or 8-13 Hertz (Hz).# Alpha represents a sort of 'idle' state, or 'ready but not doing much' state and is normally fairly large over the back third of the brain when the eyes are closed and when you are awake.# Alpha disappears when we either get mentally busy (e.g., open the eyes, start doing intense mental work even eyes closed) or when we become drowsy.# Thus the presence of alpha can show the presence of an awake, resting state,# If it is present at a fairly high voltage when the eyes are open, this would usually indicate an inattentive, daydreamy state.# In fact we often see this sign in adolescents and adults with attentional difficulties.Beta waves# The beta family of waves happen at frequencies from 16-40 Hz or higher.# When we get mentally busy and engaged, we should see alpha 'block,' or reduce significantly in size.# In its place we see mostly smaller, quicker 'beta' waves.Delta and theta waves# Are relatively slow.# Delta is usually defined as waves occurring from 1-4 times per second (1-4 Hz).# Theta occurs at 4-7 Hz.# During drowsiness, first alpha disappears, then the size of theta waves begins to increase.# As sleep begins, theta waves get quite large, then become mixed with and eventually give way to slower delta waves.# The presence of delta and theta waves in the waking, eyes open EEG is normal, but only if the waves are fairly small.# High-amplitude slow waves can be signs of various neurological and psychological problems, ranging from epilepsy to ADHD. Educational points:# In a typical night of sleep, a young adult first enters NREM sleep, passes through stages 1 and 2, and spends 70-100 minutes in stages 3 and 4.# Sleep then lightens, and an REM period follows. This cycle is repeated at intervals of about 90 minutes throughout the night. The cycles are similar, though there is less stage 3 and 4 sleep and more REM sleep towards morning.# Thus, four to six REM periods occur per night. REM sleep occupies 80% of total sleep time in premature infants and 50% in full-term neonates.# Thereafter, proportion of REM sleep falls rapidly and plateaus at about 25% until it falls further in old age.# In REM, there occurs | and variable pulse, | and variable blood pressure, penile/clitoral tumescence. ACh is the principal neurotransmitter involved in REM sleep.# Children have more total sleep time and stage 4 sleep than adults.# Serotonergic predominance of raphe nucleus key to initiating sleep.# NE reduces REM sleep.# Extraocular movements during REM due to activity of PPRF (paramedian pontine reticular formation/conjugate gaze center).# Benzodiazepines shorten stage 4 sleep; thus useful for night terrors and sleepwalking# Imipramine is used to treat enuresis because it | stage 4 sleep.# Characteristic feature of NREM stage IV sleep is DELTA waves.FeatureStage of SleepCardiovascular activity in Sleep:Beta wavesAwake with eyes openNREM:BP |with less variability, CO |, vasodilation increases (|flow resistance).Alpha wavesAwake with closed eyesIheta wavesStage 1Tonic REM :BP stays the same, CO stays the same, muscles vasoconstriction.Sleep-SpindlesStage 2Delta wavesStage 3 & 4Phasic REM:BP variable, CO stays the same, whole body vasoconstriction.Beta wavesREM (same as Awake)Mnemonic: (BATS Drink Blood)",A

The classic pathway of complement activation is initiated by an antibody-antigen interaction. The first complement component (C1, a complex composed of three proteins) binds to immune complexes with activation. Active C l then initiates the cleavage and concomitant activation of components C4 and C2. The activated C1 is destroyed by a plasma protease inhibitor termed C1 esterase inhibitor. This molecule also regulates clotting factor XI and kallikrein. Patients with a deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor may develop angioedema, sometimes leading to death by asphyxia. Attacks may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition to low antigenic or functional levels of C1 esterase inhibitor, patients with this autosomal dominant condition may have normal levels of Cl and C3 but low levels of C4 and C2. Danazol therapy produces a striking increase in the level of this impoant inhibitor and alletes the symptoms in many patients.

C. They increase the efficiency of vibration transfer through the middle earThe transfer of energy through the middle ear from the relatively large eardrum to the smaller oval window by the ossicular chain increases the efficiency of the mechanical transduction process. The bones do not support the membrane structures but allow them to move relatively freely. Interference with the ossicular transmission process by external influences (as by the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles) or by disease processes, acts to reduce the vibration transfer efficiency, a change that can be either protective or harmful.

Codominance means that multiple versions of the gene may be active or expressed, and the genetic trait is caused by the effects of both the expressed alleles. The SERPINA1 gene on chromosome 14 codes for A1AT, which is a protein that protects tissues (especially the lungs) from neutrophil elastase. A1AT is synthesized in the liver and secreted into the circulation. Under normal conditions, neutrophils in the lung engulf and destroy particulate matter in the air we breathe. At times, the protease elastase escapes from the neutrophils, and is inactivated by A1AT. In the absence of functional A1AT, the elastase destroys the lung cells, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will occur very early in life. If the patient smokes, the condition is greatly exacerbated. A common mutation in A1AT leads to misfolding and accumulation of the misfolded form of the protein in the liver.

Which causes antral gastrin release?,Antral distension,Acid,Secretin,Calcitonin,"Gastrin is produced by cells called G cells in the antral poion of the gastric mucosa.G cells are flask-shaped, with a broad base containing many gastrin granules and a narrow apex that reaches the mucosal surface. Microvilli project from the apical end into the lumen. Receptors mediating gastrin responses to changes in gastric contents are present on the microvilli. Other cells in the gastrointestinal tract that secrete hormones have a similar morphology. Gastrin is typical of a number of polypeptide hormones in that it shows both microheterogeneity and microheterogeneity. Microheterogeneity refers to the occurrence in tissues and body fluids of peptide chains of various lengths; microheterogeneity refers to differences in molecular structure due to derivatization of single amino acid residues. preprogastrin is processed into fragments of various sizes. Three main fragments contain 34, 17, and 14 amino acid residues. All have the same carboxyl terminal configuration. In large doses, gastrin has a variety of actions, but its principal physiologic actions are stimulation of gastric acid and pepsin secretion and stimulation of the growth of the mucosa of the stomach and small and large intestines (trophic action). Gastrin secretion is affected by the contents of the stomach, the rate of discharge of the vagus nerves, and bloodborne factors. Atropine does not inhibit the gastrin response to a test meal in humans, because the transmitter secreted by the postganglionic vagal fibers that innervate the G cells is gastrin-releasing polypeptide rather than acetylcholine. Gastrin secretion is also increased by the presence of the products of protein digestion in the stomach, paicularly amino acids, which act directly on the G cells. Phenylalanine and tryptophan are paicularly effective. The acid in the antrum inhibits gastrin secretion, paly by a direct action on G cells and paly by release of somatostatin, a relatively potent inhibitor of gastric secretion. The effect of acid is the basis of a negative feedback loop regulating gastrin secretion. Increased secretion of the hormone increases acid secretion, but the acid then feeds back to inhibit fuher gastrin secretion. In conditions such as pernicious anemia in which the acid-secreting cells of the stomach are damaged, gastrin secretion is chronically elevated.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:443",A

Serious or type II DCS can include symptoms in the CNS, lungs, and circulatory system. The CNS disorder--most commonly involving the spinal cord--reflects bubble formation in the myelin sheath of axons that compromises nerve conduction. Symptoms may range from dizziness ('staggers') to paralysis. Pulmonary symptoms ('chokes')--resulting from gas emboli in the pulmonary circulation--include burning pain on inspiration, cough, and respiratory distress. In the circulatory system, bubbles can not only obstruct blood flow but also trigger the coagulation cascade and lead to the release of vasoactive substances.

Thus BP in mm Hg= BP in kPa x 7.5 or 1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa.o The blood pressure is not steady, it fluctuates during cardiac cycle,o During ventricular systole, BP is higher than during diastole.o The maximum arterial pressure attained during systole is called the systolic BP (SBP) and the minimum pressure recorded during diastole is called diastolic BP (DBP).o When recorded from the brachial artery of a young adult in the sitting or supine position, the SBP is about 120 mm Hg and the DBP is about 80 mm Hg.o The difference between the systolic and diastolic pressure is called the pulse pressureQ,o It is normally about 40 mm Hg (120 minus 80 mm Hg).o The mean blood pressure is the average pressure throughout the cardiac cycle.o However, it is worth noting that mean BP is not the arithmetic mean or average of the systolic or diastolic BP.o This is because systole is much shorter than diastole.o Therefore arterial pressure is near the diastolic pressure for a longer part of cardiac cycle than it is near the systolic pressure; hence, greater weight is given to the diastolic BP in the calculation of mean BP.o Thus, mean BP is slightly less than the simple average of the systolic and diastolic BP.o As an approximation, the mean BP is weighted 2 : 1 in favour of diastolic BP.Mean blood pressure = 2/3 diastolic pressure (DBP) + 1/3 rd systolic pressure (SBP)o Normally, mean BP is about 93 mm Hg Q (2 x 80 +120)/3.",B

C5-9 Components of complement cascade mediate various biological responses o C5a, C3a, to a lesser extent C4a - are called anaphylotoxin because they have effects similar to those of mast cell mediators that are involved in the reaction called anaphylaxis. These effects are due to stimulation of histamine release by these anaphylotoxin. The effects are increased vascular permeability and vasodilatation. o C5a is a powerful chemotactic agent o C3b, C3bi act as opsonin and enhance phagocytosis. o C5-9 called membrane attack complex (MAC).

Which causes raised angiotensin in blood?,Increased blood volume,Raised cardiac output,Decreased blood pressure,Increased sympathetic tone,"A polypeptide in the blood that causes vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, and the release of aldosterone from the adrenal coex. Angiotensin is formed by the action of renin on angiotensinogen, an alpha-2-glycoprotein that is produced in the liver and that constantly circulates in the blood. Renin, stimulated by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney in response to decreased blood volume and serum sodium levels, acts as an enzyme in the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is rapidly hydrolyzed to form the active compound, angiotensin II. The vasoconstrictive action of angiotensin II decreases the glomerular filtration rate, and the concomitant action of aldosterone promotes sodium retention, with the result that blood volume and sodium reabsorption increase.

Investigation for definitive identification of cryptosporodium: March 2010,ELISA,Immunofluorescence test,Demonstration of oocyte in feces,Fluoroscent staining with auramine,"Ans. B: Immunofluorescence test Diagnosis of cryptosporidium is made by demonstration of oocyst in feces Methods of detection and confirmation of cryptosporodium Wet mount-In bright-field microscopy using differential interference contrast (DIC), oocysts appear as small round structures (4 to 6 im) similar to yeasts. They do not autofluoresce. Modified acid-fast stain-Oocysts (4 to 6 im) often have distinct oocyst walls and stain from light pink to bright red. In paicular, infections that are resolving can have colorless oocyst 'ghosts.' Mature oocysts may have discernible sporozoites (up to 4). Indirect fluorescent antibody assay-This technique offers the highest combination of sensitivity and specificity and is considered the gold standard. However, it does not provide a stained slide that can be archived. It requires special equipment (fluorescence microscope) and commercially available test kits. Methods for detection (but not confirmation) of Cryptosporidium Oocysts may be detected by the following methods, but should be confirmed by the diagnostic techniques listed above. Safranin stain-Oocysts of Cryptosporidium often (but not always) stain a bright reddish-orange color. This method, advocated for Cyclospora, is not widely used for Cryptosporidium because the Cryptosporidium oocysts may not always properly stain. - Trichrome stain-Oocysts may be detected, but should not be confirmed, by this method. This staining method is inadequate for definitive diagnosis because all oocysts will appear unstained. Oocysts appear as small round structures measuring 4 to 6 im.

"If the head of the femur is dislocated postero-medially, compression of which nerve is likely to be a result?",Femoral,Lumbosacral trunk,Obturator,Sciatic,"The sciatic nerve is closely related to the posterior hip joint, which makes this nerve very vulnerable in cases where the femur is dislocated postero-medially. If the sciatic nerve was completely paralyzed, the compaments innervated by its two branches: the common fibular and tibial nerves, would lose function. This would mean that the hamstrings and all the muscles of below the knee would lose their innervation. (Luckily, complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve is very rare). The hip joint is very stable, so it is difficult to dislocate the femur. Most dislocations occur when the hip is flexed and the thigh is adducted. In flexion, the joint capsule is lax, and the femoral head tends to dislocate posteriorly when forces drive the femur posteriorly. This means that the sciatic nerve will be very vulnerable when the femur is dislocated!The other nerves listed in the question are not closely related to the hip joint. The femoral nerve innervates the quadriceps and is on the anterior of the thigh. The lumbosacral trunk is located in the pelvis. The obturator nerve innervates the adductor compament, and is on the anteromedial side of the thigh. Although the superior gluteal nerve innervates muscles near the hip socket (gluteus medius, minimus, and tensor fasciae latae), it would not be damaged by a dislocated hip.",D

Sustained depolarization closes the Na+ channels and prevents the occurrence of action potentials in the muscle.,D
Number of ATP formed per turn of citric acid cycle is,5,7,10,15,"TEN ATP ARE FORMED PER TURN OF THE CITRIC ACID CYCLE As a result of oxidations catalyzed by the dehydrogenases of the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH and one of FADH2 are produced for each molecule of acetyl-CoA catabolized in one turn of the cycle. These reducing equivalents are transferred to the respiratory chain, where reoxidation of each NADH results in the formation of ~2.5 ATP, and of FADH2, ~1.5 ATP. In addition, 1 ATP (or GTP) is formed by substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinate thiokinase. Reference: Harper; 30th edition; Page no: 164",C

Free radicals are generated by all except,FC and C3b,Receptor mediated endocytosis,Respiratory burst,Pseudopod extension,"Ref Robbins 9/e p78 Accumulation of Oxygen-Derived Free Radicals (Oxidative Stress) Free radicals are chemical species with a single unpaired electron in an outer orbital. Such chemical states are extremely unstable, and free radicals readily react with inorganic and organic chemicals; when generated in cells, they avidly attack nucleic acids as well as a variety of cel- lular proteins and lipids. In addition, free radicals initiate reactions in which molecules that react with free radicals are themselves conveed into other types of free radicals, thereby propagating the chain of damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a type of oxygen- derived free radical whose role in cell injury is well estab- lished. Cell injury in many circumstances involves damage by free radicals; these situations include ischemia- reperfusion (discussed later on), chemical and radiation injury, toxicity from oxygen and other gases, cellular aging, microbial killing by phagocytic cells, and tissue injury caused by inflammatory cells. There are different types of ROS, and they are produced by two major pathways (Fig. 1-18). * ROS are produced normally in small amounts in all cells during the reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions that occur during mitochondrial respiration and energy genera- tion. In this process, molecular oxygen is sequentially reduced in mitochondria by the addition of four elec- trons to generate water. This reaction is imperfect, however, and small amounts of highly reactive but sho-lived toxic intermediates are generated when oxygen is only paially reduced. These intermediates include superoxide (O2 * ), which is conveed to hydro- gen peroxide (H2O2) spontaneously and by the action of the enzyme superoxide dismutase. H2O2 is more stable than O2 * and can cross biologic membranes. In the pres- ence of metals, such as Fe2+ , H2O2 is conveed to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical * OH by the Fenton reaction",D

The Donnan effect on the distribution of ions has three effects in the body. First, because of charged proteins (Prot-) in cells, there are more osmotically active paicles in cells than in interstitial fluid, and because animal cells have flexible walls, osmosis would make them swell and eventually rupture if it were not for Na, K ATPase pumping ions back out of cells. Thus, normal cell volume and pressure depend on Na, K ATPase. Second, because at equilibrium the distribution of permeant ions across the membrane (m in the example used here) is asymmetric, an electrical difference exists across the membrane whose magnitude can be determined by the Nernst equation. Third, because there are more proteins in plasma than in interstitial fluid, there is a Donnan effect on ion movement across the capillary wall.' 'The plasma proteins do more than just act as osmotic agents. Because these proteins also carry negative charges, the Donnan effect causes an increase in both the concentrations of cations and the colloid osmotic pressure in the capillary lumen.'",C

Which of the following metabolic events will not occur following 12-24 hour of fasting,Increase in free fatty acids,Increase in ketone bodies,Decrease in Glycogen,Decrease in Serum Proteins,"D i.e. Decrease in serum ProteinsGlycogenolysis and liver gluconeogenesis (initially by degradation of glucogenic aminoacids of muscle proteins followed by glycerol & lactate) are sources of energy in brief (1st stage) of starvation (ie 12 to 72 hours of fasting). Gluconeogenesis the main process, increases during brief fasting but decreases on prolonged fasting.- During starvation serum proteins are not utilized as a source of energyQ. Brief fasting is associated with increased proteolysis (break down) of muscle proteins (not serum proteins) thereby decreasing total muscle proteins, whereas the serum protein levels are unaltered (ie not decreased)Q. Proteolysis of muscles provide glucogenic aminoacids (alanine & glutamine increasing liver gluconeogenesis- On prolonged fasting (starvation), adipose tissue breakdown (beta-oxidation) becomes the main source of energy; thereby increasing production of ketone bodies. However it is impoant to note that this over produced ketone bodies are utilized mainly by brain not by muscles as the utilization of glucose by brain and utilization of ketone bodies by by-muscle decreases during prolonged starvation. In the same way, decreased gluconeogenesis in prolonged starvation is responsible for decreased muscle protein degradation and decreased production of urea.",D

Chylomicrons are synthesized in the small intestine that contain triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, phosphlipids, and apoprotein B-48 (apo B-48) and apo-A.o These chylomicrons are secreted in the intestinal lymph and reach the systemic circulation via thoracic duct,o In the circulation apo E and apo C are transfered to chylomicrons by HDL, so now chylomicrons contain apo A, apo B-48, apo- E, & apo-C.o In the circulation, triglycerides of chylomicrons are hydrolysed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) present on endothelial cells of vessels of skeletal muscles, adipose tissue and heart, but not in liver.o The released fatty acids are utilized locally by these tissues.o Adipose tissue uses these fatty acids to restore them as TGs and heart and skeletal muscle use them as source of energy.o Thus, function of chylomicrons is to transport exogenous (dietryjtriglyceride0 to adipose tissue (for storage), heart (for energy) and muscle (for energy').o The chylomicron particle progressively shrinks in size by action of LPL and, cholesterol, phospholipids, apo-A and apo C are transferred to HDL, creating chylomicron remnants that contains more cholesterol, less triglycerides, apo-E & apo B-48.o Chylomicron remnants are removed by liver by the LDL receptors that require apo-E as ligand.o VLDL carries endogenous triglycerides (triglycerides from liver to extrahepatic tissues).o Chylomicrons carry exogenous (dietiy) triglycerides to extrahepatic tissues and remaining triglyceride to liver through chylomicron remnants.Transport of lipidso There are two pathways of lipid transport in the body -1. Transport of dietry lipid (Exogenous pathway)o It is the transport of lipid from intestine to liver.o Chylomicrons transport the dietry lipid from intestine to liverr.o In diet the major lipids are triglyceride and cholesterol.o Cholesterol is absorbed as such in proximal small intestine and is esterified to cholestery! ester (ChE). Triglycerides are hydrolysed by lipases to glycerol and fatty acids which are absorbed in intestine.o Inside intestinal cells triglyceride is synthesized by fatty acids. Chylomicrons are synthesized in the small intestine that contain triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, phosphlipids, and apoprotein B-48 (apo B-48) and apo-A.o These chylomicrons are secreted in the intestinal lymph and reach the systemic circulation via thoracic duct.o In the circulation apo E and apo C are transfered to chylomicrons by HDL, so now chylomicrons contain apo A, apo B-48, apo- E, & apo-C.o In the circulation, triglycerides of chylomicrons are hydrolysed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) present on endothelial cells of vessels of skeletal muscles, adipose tissue and heart, but not in liver.o The released fatty acids are utilized locally by these tissues.o Adipose tissue uses these fatty acids to restore them as TGs and heart and skeletal muscle use them as source of energy.o Thus, function of chylomicrons is to transport exogenous (dietry)triglyceriderto adipose tissue (for storage), heart (for energy) and muscle (for energy).o The chylomicron particle progressively shrinks in size by action of LPL and, cholesterol, phospholipids, apo-A and apo C are transferred to HDL, creating chylomicron remnants that contains more cholesterol, less triglycerides, apo-E & apo B-48.o Chylomicron remnants are removed by liver bv the LDL receptors that require apo-E as ligand.2. Transport of Hepatic lipids (Endogenous pathway)o VLDL is synthesized in liver that contains high triglyceride, ChE, cholesterol, phospholipid and Apo B-100. (VLDL particles resemble chylomicrones in composition except that VLDL contains Apo B-100 instead of Apo B-48).o VLDL particles are secreted in the plasma and as with chylomicron, Apo E and Apo C are transferred from HDL to VLDL. Now VLDL contains Apo B-100, Apo E and Apo C.o In plasma, triglycerides of VLDL are hydrolysed by same lipoprotein lipase (see above) and apo C is transferred to HDL and the remmants are called IDL.o 40-60% of IDL is removed by liver via LDL receptor mediated endocytosis, this process require Apo E which acts as ligand for LDL receptors.o Remaining IDL is remodeled by hepatic lipase which hydrolyzes more triglyceride to form LDL that contains maximum cholesterol.o 70% of LDL is removed by liver via LDL receptor and 30% is utilized by peripheral tissues as a source of cholesterol.",D

All are true about Leptin EXCEPT:,It increases appetite,It is increased in obesity,Its receptor is in hypothalamus,Expressed in adipose tissue,"Leptin is a protein secreted by adipocytes (of the white adipose tissue). It is related to cytokines; hence sometimes it is called adipocytokine. Option D is a correct. It is sends signals to the hypothalamus regarding the degree of adiposity and nutrition, which in turn controls eating behavior and energy expenditure. Option C is a correct. As fat stores increase, plasma leptin levels increase (option B); and, as the fat stores are depleted, leptin levels decrease. High leptin levels inhibit the neuropeptide Y (NPY) secreting neurons of the hypothalamus. NPY is an orexigenic agent; inhibition of NPY neurons will decrease the appetite and food intake.Thus, option A is an incorrect.

"A 32-year-old male basketball player comes down hard on his ankle. He is admitted to the outpatient clinic, and radiographic examination reveals a Pott's fracture. What ligament is most likely injured?",Calcaneofibular ligament,Deltoid ligament,Spring ligament,Plantar ligament,"Pott's fracture is a rather archaic term for a fracture of the fibula at the ankle. The term is often used to indicate a bimalleolar fracture of fibula and tibia, perhaps with a tear in the medial collateral ligament, allowing the foot to be deviated laterally. (The medial malleolus will often break before the deltoid ligament tears.) This fracture is also known as Dupuytren's fracture. The fracture results from abduction and lateral rotation of the foot in extreme eversion. There can also be breaking of the posterior aspect of the distal tibia. The spring ligament, also known as the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, extends from the calcaneus to the navicular bone and is a part of the medial longitudinal arch. This ligament would not be affected in eversion or inversion of the ankle. The plantar ligament, which is composed of the long and short plantar ligaments, supports the lateral longitudinal arch of the foot and would therefore not be affected by inversion or eversion of the foot. The calcaneofibular ligament runs from the calcaneus to the fibula. It would be injured during inversion of the foot, not in eversion, as is the case in a Pott fracture.",B

The intravesical pressure rises abruptly when the bladder volume is about,400 ml,300 ml,200 ml,100 ml,"The relation between intravesical pressure and volume can be studied by inseing a catheter and emptying the bladder, then recording the pressure while the bladder is filled with 50-mL increments of water or air(cystometry). A plot of intravesical pressure against the volume of fluid in the bladder is called a cystometrogram). The curve shows an initial slight rise in pressure when the first increments in volume are produced; along, nearly flat segment as fuher increments are produced; and a sudden, sharp rise in pressure as the micturition reflex is triggered. These three components are sometimes called segments Ia, Ib, and II. The first urge to void is felt at a bladder volume of about 150 mL, and a marked sense of fullness about 400 mL. The flatness of segment Ib is a manifestation of the law of Laplace. This law states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fill, but so does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full.

Enteric fever diagnosis in 2nd week is best made by: September 2012,Blood,Widal test,Stool,Widal,"Ans. B i.e. Widal test Widal test It is a presumptive serological test for enteric fever or undulant fever whereby bacteria causing typhoid fever are mixed with serum containing specific antibodies obtained from an infected individual. In case of Salmonella infections, it is a demonstration of the presence of 0-soma false-positive result. Test results need to be interpreted carefully in the light of past history of enteric fever, typhoid vaccination, and the general level of antibodies in the populations in endemic areas of the world. As with all serological tests, the rise in antibody levels needed to perform the diagnosis takes 7-14 days, which limits it applicability in early diagnosis. Other means of diagnosing Salmonella typhi (and paratyphi) include cultures of blood, urine and faeces. These organisms produce H2S from thiosulfate and can be easily identified on differential media such as Bismuth sulfite agar. Often 2-mercaptoethanol is added to the Widal test. This agent more easily denatures the IgM class of antibodies, so if a decrease in the titer is seen after using this agent, it means that the contribution of IgM has been removed leaving the IgG component. This differentiation of antibody classes is impoant; as it allows for the distinction of a recent (IgM) from an old infection (IgG). The Widal test is positive if TO antigen titer is more than 1:160 in an active infection, or if TH antigen titer is more than 1:160 in past infection or in immunized persons. A single Widal test is of little clinical relevance due to the number of cross reacting infections, including malaria. If no other tests (either bacteriologic culture or more specific serology) are available, a fourfold increase in the titer (e.g., from 1:40 to 1:160) in the course of the infection, or a conversion from an IgM reaction to an IgG reaction of at least the same titer, would be consistent with a typhoid infection.",B

The two Coombs tests are the direct Coombs test (DCT, also known as direct antiglobulin test or DAT), and the indirect Coombs test (also known as indirect antiglobulin test or IAT). The direct Coombs test is used to detect these antibodies or complement proteins that are bound to the surface of red blood cells; a blood sample is taken and the RBCs are washed (removing the patient's own plasma) and then incubated with antihuman globulin (also known as 'Coombs reagent') . If this produces agglutination of RBCs, the direct Coombs test is positive, a visual indication that antibodies (and/or complement proteins) are bound to the surface of red blood cells. The indirect Coombs test is used in prenatal testing of pregnant women and in testing blood prior to a blood transfusion. It detects antibodies against RBCs that are present unbound in the patient's serum. In this case, the rum is extracted from the blood sample taken from the patient. Then, the serum is incubated with RBCs of known antigenicity; that is, RBCs with known reference values from other patient blood samples. If agglutination occurs, the indirect Coombs test is positive. Ref: Ananthanarayan & Parker's textbook of microbiology 9th edition pg:109",B

The tubuloglomerular feedback is mediated by,Sensing of Na+ concentration in the macula densa,Sensing of Cl+ concentration in macula densa,Sensing NaCl concentration in the macula densa,Opening up of voltage gated Na+ channels in afferent aeriole,"Signals from the renal tubule in each nephron feedback to affect filtration in its glomerulus. As the rate of flow through the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and first pa of the distal tubule increases, glomerular filtration in the same nephron decreases, and, conversely, a decrease in flow increases the GFR. This process, which is called tubuloglomerular feedback, tends to maintain the constancy of the load delivered to the distal tubule. The sensor for this response is the macula densa. The amount of fluid entering the distal tubule at the end of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle depends on the amount of Na+ and Cl- in it. The Na+ and Cl- enter the macula densa cells the Na-K-2Cl cotranspoer in their apical membranes. The increased Na+ causes increased Na, K ATPase activity and the resultant increased ATP hydrolysis causes more adenosine to be formed. Presumably, adenosine is secreted from the basal membrane of the cells. It acts adenosine A1 receptors on the macula densa cells to increase their release of Ca2+ to the vascular smooth muscle in the afferent aerioles. This causes afferent vasoconstriction and a resultant decrease in GFR. Presumably, a similar mechanism generates a signal that decreases renin secretion by the adjacent juxtaglomerular cells in the afferent aeriole, but this remains unsettled.

Which of the following is suitably accommodated within the first turn of an alpha helix?,Alanine,Aspaic acid,Tyrosine,Glycine,"The stability of an alpha helix arises primarily from hydrogen bonds formed between the oxygen of the peptide bond carbonyl and the hydrogen atom of the peptide bond nitrogen of the fouh residue down the polypeptide chain. The ability to form the maximum number of hydrogen bonds, supplemented by van der Waals interactions in the core of this tightly packed structure, provides the thermodynamic driving force for the formation of an alpha helix. Since the peptide bond nitrogen of proline lacks a hydrogen atom to contribute to a hydrogen bond, proline can only be stably accommodated within the first turn of an alpha helix. When present elsewhere, proline disrupts the conformation of the helix, producing a bend. Because of its small size, glycine also often induces bends in alpha helices.

Dorsal column relay in which nucleus:,Substantia gelatinosa,Nucleus proprius,Accessory cuneate nucleus,Gracile nucleus,"Ans. D. Gracile nucleusa. The dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway is a sensory pathway of the central nervous system that conveys sensations of fine touch, vibration, two-point discrimination, and proprioception (position) from the skin and joints.b. The pathway receives information from sensory receptors throughout the body, and carries this in nerve tracts in the white matter of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, to the medulla where it is continued in the medial lemniscus, on to the thalamus and relayed from there through the internal capsule and transmitted to the somatosensory cortex.c. There are three groupings of neurons that are involved in the pathway: first-order neurons, second-order neurons, and third-order neurons. The first-order neurons are sensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia, that send their afferent fibers through the two dorsal columns - the gracile fasciculus, or gracile tract, and the cuneate fasciculus or cuneate tract. The first-order axons make contact with second-order neurons at the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus in the lower medulla. The second-order neurons send their axons to the thalamus. The third- order neurons are in the ventral nuclear group in the thalamus and fibres from these ascend to the postcentral gyrus.",D

Amino acid with dissociation constant closest to physiological pH is,Serine,Histidine,Threonine,Proline,"To understand dissociation constant (pKa) of amino acids one must know the ionizable groups of amino acids.
Each amino acid has two ionizable groups (i) Î±-carboxyl group (-COOH), and (ii) Î±-amino group (-NH2).
Besides these two groups, some amino acids have special ionizable groups. e.g. -SH of cysteine, imidazole of histidine.
The dissociation constant (pKa) is the value of pH at which any ionizable group of the amino acid is in 50% ionized form and 50% non-ionized form.
Thus, each amino acid has two pKa values:-

pk1:- pH at which 50% of amino acid molecules have a-carboxyl group in the ionized form (COO-) and 50% molecules have it in unionized form (COOH).
pk2:- pH at which 50% of amino acid molecules have an a-amino group in the ionized form (NH3+) and 50% molecules have it in unionized form (NH2).

The value of pk-1 and pk-2 is different for different amino acids. But it ranges between 3.5-4.0 for pk-1 (i.e. pKa of Î± -carboxyl group is 3.5-4.0) and 8.0-9.0 for pk-2 (i.e. pKa of a-amino group is 8.0-9.0).

Beside a-carboxyl and a-amino group, some amino acids contain special ionizable group, which will provide one more pKa value (pk3). For example pKa of imidazole group of histidine ranges between 6.5-7.4. That means somewhere between pH 6.5-7.4, 50% of histidine molecules in a solution will have imidazole group in ionized form and 50% molecules will have in unionized form",B

The underlying cause for these problems is which one of the following?",Adrenal insufficiency,Pituitary insufficiency,Lack of insulin,Lack of glucagon,"The patient is exhibiting the symptoms of Addison disease, initiated by an adrenal insufficiency. Owing to the problem in the adrenal glands, cortisol and aldosterone cannot be produced and released. The lack of cortisol leads to hypoglycemia and fatigue. The lack of aldosterone leads to the alteration in salt balance in the blood and the craving for salt. The hyperpigmentation occurs because of excessive ACTH production, which gives rise to the MSH. The ACTH levels are high because of reduced repression of ACTH synthesis, which is caused by the lack of cortisol release from the adrenal cortex. A reduction of insulin levels would lead to diabetes, not the constellation of symptoms observed in this patient.

This is associated with infection of mucosal or sequestered sites by TSST-producing Staph, aureus strains usually belonging to bacteriophage group I. TSST type-1 (formerly also known as enterotoxin type F or pyrogenic exotoxin C) is most often responsible, though enterotoxins B or C may also cause the syndrome.TSS was first identified in 1978 in children and adolescents, but became widely known only in 1980 following out- breaks in the USA in menstruating women using highly absorbent vaginal tampons. Their vaginal swabs showed heavy growth of staph, aureus, though blood cultures were invariably negative. TSST-1 antibody is seen in convalescents. This is protective and absence of TSST-1 antibody is a factor in the pathogenesis of the condition.Though tampon-related TSS is now rare, the syndrome occurs in other infections of the skin, mucosa and other sites and also in some surgical wounds.",A

Through which of the following means of transpo is folic acid absorbed in proximal jejunum?,Facilitated diffusion,Active transpo,Passive transpo,Both active and passive transpo,"Folic acid is absorbed in the proximal jejunum through both active and passive transpo. First step in the absorption of folate involves hydrolysis of pteroyl polyglutamates into pteroyl monoglutamate by conjugase enzyme located in the intestinal mucosa. Next step involves absorption of pteroyl monoglutamate through active carrier mediated transpo. Besides this, pharmacologic doses of folate are also absorbed passively by facilitated diffusion. After absorption from the lumen into the enterocyte intracellular enzymes reduce and methylate the monoglutamate to produce metabolically active form of folic acid. This form is then absorbed into circulation by simple diffusion. Most of the vitamins are absorbed passively. Cyanocobalamin is the only vitamin that that depends on active transpo for its absorption. Folic acid and thiamine are the only other vitamins for which active mechanism of absorption is known.

An 18 year old is brought to the emergency room following an automobile accident. Serum enzyme studies demonstrate a thousand-fold elevation of creatine kinase (CK). Which of the following tissues is most likely to be the source of the enzyme?,Bone,Brain,Hea,Skeletal muscle,"Creatine kinase occurs in several different forms, or isoenzymes, in the body. Most tissues contain a mix of creatine kinase isoenzymes, but one species often predominates. The MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase is associated with hea damage; the MM isoenzyme is associated with muscle damage; and the BB isoenzyme is associated with brain damage. Surgery and trauma are commonly implicated as causes of sufficient skeletal muscle trauma to markedly elevated creatine kinase. If isoenzyme studies are done, the CK-MM (skeletal muscle isoenzyme) isoenzyme will be elevated much more markedly than the CK-MB isoenzyme. Bone is not a significant source of CK. Brain can occasionally be a source of creatine kinase (BB isoenzyme), but would not usually be the major source following an automobile accident. Hea damage as in myocardial infarction (unlikely at this age), can elevate creatine kinase, but would not usually be the major source in an automobile accident. If the dilemma arises as to whether an automobile accident was possibly secondary to a myocardial infarction, the ratio of CK-MB to total CK may be helpful in demonstrating a cardiac contribution (CK-MB is characteristic of hea muscle).

HSL is an intracellular neutral lipase that is capable of hydrolyzing a variety of esters. The enzyme has a long and a short form. The long form is expressed in steroidogenic tissues such as testis, where it converts cholesteryl esters to free cholesterol for steroid hormone production. The short form is expressed in adipose tissue, among others, where it hydrolyzes stored triglycerides to free fatty acidsHSL is activated when the body needs to mobilize energy stores, and so responds positively to catecholamines, ACTH, and negatively to insulin. Previously, glucagon was thought to activate HSL, however the removal of insulins inhibitory effects ('cutting the brakes') is the source of activation.There are various types of lipases in the human body:HormoneFunction and locationBile salt dependent lipasePancreas and breast. Aids in digestion of fatPancreatic lipasePancreatic juiceLysosomal lipaseIntracellularly, in the lysosomes.Hepatic lipaseEndothelium of liver and adrenals, convert intermediate-density1, lipoprotein (IDL) to low-density lipoprotein (LDL).LipoproteinlipaseExpressed on endothelial cells in the heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. Dual functions of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand,''bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. Hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins, such as those found in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), into two free fatty acids and one monoacylglycerol molecule. It is also involved in promoting the cellular uptake of chylomicron remnants, cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, and free fatty acids. Through catalysis, VLDL is converted to IDL and then to LDL. LPL requires Apo-CII as a cofactor.Hormone sensitive lipaseEndothelium of adipose tissue and gonads. HSL functions to hydrolyze the first fatty acid from a triacyiglycerol molecule, freeing a fatty acid and diglyceride. Enzyme is affected by hormones; hence its hormone-sensitive lipase name. It is activated by cAMP by protein kinase. Growth hormone, glucagon, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones increase the activity, while insulin and prostaglandins decrease its activity.Gastric lipaseGastric lipase is an acidic lipase secreted by the gastric chief cells in the fun- dic mucosa in the stomach. Gastric lipase together with lingual lipase, comprise the two acidic lipases. These lipases, unlike alkaline lipases (such as pancreatic lipase), do not require bile acid or colipase for optimal enzymatic activity.",A

A competitive inhibitor of an enzyme will?,Alter the Vmax of the reaction,Bind to the same site as the substrate,Decrease the apparent Km for the substrate,Decrease the turnover number,"Substances that reduce the activity of an enzyme are called inhibitors. Reversible inhibitors bind to an enzyme but rapidly dissociate from it . There are several types of reversible inhibitors: Competitive inhibitors usually resemble the substrate and compete with it for binding at the active site. Thus, increasing the concentration of substrate will decrease the percent inhibition of the enzyme. The Vmax is unchanged, but the Km is increased. A noncompetitive inhibitor binds with equal affinity to both enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex. This binding leads to a distoion of the substrate binding site, so new substrate cannot bind and/or the product cannot be released. In this kind of inhibition, the Vmax is decreased (choice A), but the Km is not altered. Adding more substrate will not reverse this type of inhibition. This is the equivalent of decreasing the turnover number. An uncompetitive inhibitor does not bind to free enzyme, but binds to the enzyme-substrate complex at a site other than the catalytic site. Once bound by the inhibitor, the enzyme is trapped in the enzyme-substrate complex state until the inhibitor dissociates. In this kind of inhibition, the slope of the reaction (which is the ratio Km/Vmax) remains the same, but both Vmax and Km are reduced. Ref: Janson L.W., Tischler M.E. (2012). Chapter 5.

Atractiloside inhibits translocase, a transport protein that transports ADP into mitochondria for phosphorylation into ATP.UncouplesAs the name suggests, these componds block the coupeling of oxidation with phosphorylation. These compounds allow the transfer of reducing equivalents in respiratory chain but prevent the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP by uncoupling the linkage between ETC and phosphorylation. Thus the energy instead of being trapped by phosphory lation is dissipated as heat. Uncouplers may be :- Natural :-Thermogenin, thyroxineSynthetic :- 2, 4-dinitrophenol (2, 4-DNP), 2, 4-dinitrocresol (2, 4-DNC), and CCCP (chlorocarbonylcyanidephenyl hydrazone).",D

25 year old labourer 3 years back presented with penile ulcer not treated. Later he presented with neurological symptoms for which he got treated. Test to monitor response to treatment is ?,VDRL,FTA-ABS,TPI,RPR,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., VDRL . Neurological symptoms in a patient with history of untreated ulcer 3 years back suggests the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. To fuher clear the doubts, all the given options are serological tests for syphilis. So, the examiner is asking about the syphilis for sure. . It has alreadys been explained that for monitoring of response of therapy non specific serological tests (VDRL or RPR) are used as the specific treponemal tests remain positive inspite of treatment. Now question arises, whether to use VDRL or RPR as both the options are there in this question. Following statement will clear your doubts? ' The VDRL ( a standard test) will often indicate cure as measured by negative serologies by 12 months after therapy, whereas the RPR shows only 50% seroconversion i.e. negative serology at one year'....................... Annals on internal medicine Like VDRL test RPR test can also be used to monitor the treatment in syphilis but it is not suitable for testing C.S.F., so it cannot be used in neurosyphilis. . Titres are not interchangable between different test types. Hence, the same non-treponemal test should be used for follow up. e.g. if one has used VDRL at first follow up, then VDR1 should be used at every follow up. You should also keep in mind that though after adequate treatment of syphilis non treponemal tests (non specific tests) eventually become non-reactive. Sometimes even with sufficient treatment patients have a persistent low level positive nontreponemal test, reffered to as a serofast reaction.",A

All drugs prepared from this digitalis leaf are members of the same group and principles of administration are the same, although they vary according to speed of action and potency. Digitalis in its many forms is one of the most frequently prescribed drugs in the United States. It can be very effective in treatment of cardiac conditions, but its therapeutic range is narrow; a therapeutic dose is only about one third less than the dose that will induce toxicity. Moreover, physiologic changes due to age, electrolyte disturbances, renal impairment, metabolic disorders, and ceain hea conditions can predispose a patient to digitalis toxicity. Other drugs can also alter the effects of digitalis and lead to toxicity. Signs of Toxicity. Traditionally, nurses have been taught to count the patient&;s pulse or monitor the apical heabeat for rate and rhythm before administering a digitalis preparation. A decreased pulse rate of 60 per minute or less is an indication that the drug should be temporarily discontinued. While this is the most typical sign of digitalis intoxication, there frequently are earlier symptoms that deserve attention. Some of the more common complaints expressed by patients who are in the early stages of toxicity are nausea, blurred vision, mental depression, disorientation, and malaise.

It is commonly called scleroderma because the skin is a major target, but this disorder is better labeled 'systemic' because lesions are present throughout the body. Cutaneous involvement is the usual presenting manifestation and eventually appears in approximately 95% of cases, but it is the visceral involvement--of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, kidneys, hea, and skeletal muscles--that is responsible for most of the related mor- bidity and moality. SS can be classified into two groups on the basis of its clinical course: * Diffuse scleroderma, characterized by initial widespread skin involvement, with rapid progression and early vis- ceral involvement * Limited scleroderma, with relatively mild skin involve- ment, often confined to the fingers and face. Involve- ment of the viscera occurs late, so the disease in these patients generally has a fairly benign course.

Radiation exposure during infancy has been linked to which one of the following carcinoma,Breast,Melanoma,Thyroid,Lung,"Ref Robbins 8/e p312,425 and 9/e p325 The most radiosensitive organ sites in the children in order of sensitivity are the thyroid gland ,breasts, bone marrow,brain,skin. Radiation, whatever its source (UV rays of sunlight, x-rays, nuclear fission, radionuclides) is an established carcinogen. Unprotected miners of radioactive elements have a 10-fold increased incidence of lung cancers. Follow-up study of survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki disclosed a markedly increased incidence of leukemia--principally myelogenous leukemias--after an average latent period of about 7 years, as well as increased moality rates for thyroid, breast, colon, and lung carcino- mas. The nuclear power accident at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union continues to exact its toll in the form of high cancer incidence in the surrounding areas. More recently, it is feared that radiation release from a nuclear power plant in Japan damaged by a massive eahquake and tsunami will result in significantly increased cancer incidence in the surrounding geographic areas. Therapeutic irradiation of the head and neck can give rise to papillary thyroid cancers years later. The oncogenic propeies of ionizing radiation are related to its mutagenic effects; it causes chromosome breakage, translocations, and, less frequently, point mutations. Biologically, double- stranded DNA breaks seem to be the most impoant form of DNA damage caused by radiation. The oncogenic effect of UV rays merits special mention because it highlights the impoance of DNA repair in car- cinogenesis. Natural UV radiation derived from the sun can cause skin cancers (melanomas, squamous cell carcino- mas, and basal cell carcinomas). At greatest risk are fair- skinned people who live in locales such as Australia and New Zealand that receive a great deal of sunlight. Non- melanoma skin cancers are associated with total cumula- tive exposure to UV radiation, whereas melanomas are associated with intense intermittent exposure--as occurs with sunbathing. UV light has several biologic effects on cells. Of paicular relevance to carcinogenesis is the ability to damage DNA by forming pyrimidine dimers.",C

True statement about zones of blood flow in the lung:,"Going from standing to supine position, entire lung will have zone II type blood flow","In IPPV, entire lung will be conveed to zone III","In upright posture, there is no zone III anywhere in the lung","In mitral stenosis, the apex of the lung may be conveed to zone III","Normally, in the upright posture, there is zone II (intermittent blood flow) at the apex and zone III (continuous blood flow) in the remaining lung. Reason: In the upright posture, apex of the lung is above the level hea. Thus, hea has to pump the blood against gravity to send blood toward the apex. Hence, there is low pressure and lesser blood flow at the apex of the lung. Due to low pressure in the vessels, the surrounding alveoli tend to compress the vessels. Option A is incorrect: When person goes in supine position, no pa of the lung is above the level of hea; hence, blood does not have to flow against gravity. Consequently, entire lung will have continuous blood flow (zone III). Option B is incorrect: In intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), alveolar pressure increases since ventilation is being delivered under high pressure. Since surrounding alveolar pressure increases, the blood vessels will be compressed and the zones will be conveed to lower types (III --> to II; II --> to I). Option C: In upright posture, base of the lung has zone III, as the blood flows toward gravity. Pressure in the vessels > surrounding alveolar pressure. Option D: It is a correct statement. In mitral stenosis, left atrial pressure increases (as LA has to pump vigorously to send blood through the stenosed mitral valve). Increased LA pressure is reflected backward in the pulmonary vessels due to the damning back of the blood. Increased pressure in pulmonary vessels will increase the flow, conveing zone II to zone III.",D

Oxytocin causes ail EXCEPT:,Milk ejection,Induction of labour,Attaches to VI receptors,Milk production,"ANSWER: (D) Milk productionREF: Ganongs 22nd ed p- 243, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7922507OXYTOCIN:Oxytocin is a peptide of nine amino acids (a nonapeptide)released by the human posterior pituitary glandActions:Oxytocin has peripheral (hormonal) actions, and also has actions in the brain. Its actions are mediated by specific, high-affinity oxytocin receptors. The oxytocin receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptorActs on myoepithelial cells of the ducts in the breast to squeeze the milk out of areola of iactating breast causing galactokinesis or milk ejection or letting down reflex. Remember milk production is not a function of oxytocinInitiation of labour: it acts on uterine musculature to cause its contraction and initiates labour via positive feed back mechanism. However it's important to note that oxytocin acts on an endometrium primed by estrogen, and progesterone antagonises this function of oxytocin.It also acts on non pregnant uterus to cause sperm transportIt has been found that since the structure of oxytocin is similar to vasopressin it can act on VI receptors in the brain , although the effect is 10 times lesser , hence large doses of oxytocin can cause a state similar to vasopressin excessGiven as syntocinon for induction of labour in intravenous or nasal spray forms.

Tone of lower esophageal sphincter is increased by-,NO,VIP,Acetylcholine,Epinephrine,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Acetylcholine Lower esophageal sphinctero Unlike the rest of the esophagus, the musculature of the gastroesophageal junction (lower esophageal sphincter: LES) is tonically active but relaxes on swallowing,o The tonic activity of the LES between meals prevents reflux of gastirc contents into the esophagus,o The LES is made up of three components.o The esophageal smooth muscle is more prominent at the junction with the stomach (intrinsic sphincter),o Fibers of the crural portion of the diaphragm, a skeletal, a skeletal muscles, surround the esophagus at this point (extrinsic sphincter) and exert a pinchcock-like action on the esophagus. In addition, the oblique or sling fibers of the stomach wall create a flap valve that helps close off the esophagogastric junction and prevent regurgitation when intragastric pressure rises,o The tone of the LES is under neural control.o Release of acetylcholine front vagal endings causes the intrinsic sphincter to contact, and release of NO and VIP from interneurons innervated by other vagal fibers causes it to relax.o Contraction of the crural portion of the diaphragm, which is innervated by the phrenic nerves, is coordinated with respiration and contractions of chest and abdominal muscles,o Thus, the intrinsic and extrinsic sphincters operate together to permit orderly flow' of food into the stomach and to prevent reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus.",C
What is the normal daily urinary protein excretion in a normal adult?,Almost 100 mg,Almost 500 mg,Almost 1 gm,Almost 2 gm,"For a healthy young adult, Total filtered protein = GFR concentration of protein in filtrate = 180 L/day 10 mg/L = 1.8 g/day According to the above equation, the amount of protein removed from the lumen will be 1.8 g. In fact, most of the filtered protein is endocytosed and degraded so that the excretion of protein in the urine is normally only 100 mg/day. The endocytic mechanism by which protein is taken up is easily saturated, so a large increase in filtered protein resulting from increased glomerular permeability causes the excretion of large quantities of protein.

Radiographic features vary according to the type of disease and its severity and include osteopenia and fractures, which may heal with florid callus formation, mimicking osteosarcoma. 1 Bones are thin and under-tubulated (gracile), normal in length or shoened, thickened and deformed by multiple fractures. 2 Intra-sutural (Wormian) bones can be identified on skull radiographs. OSTEOGENISIS IMPERFECTA : # It is probably the most common form of skeletal dysplasia requiring substantial ohopaedic care. # Although the disease is usually apparent at bih or in childhood, more mild forms of the disease may not become apparent until adulthood, when affected individuals may present with insufficiency fractures and osteopenia. # In the more severely affected fetuses antenatal diagnosis may often be made in the second trimester on the basis of shoened long bones with multiple fractures. # The thorax tends to be sho but not narrow. Pathophysiology In most cases, 01 is caused by a dominant mutation in the COLIA I or the COLIA 2 genes that encode type I collagen. Fewer than 10 percent of 01 cases are believed to be caused by recessive mutations in other genes in the collagen pathway. Here is the production of abnormal collagen I molecules as well as a decrease in the production Of normal collagen I molecules. This results from mutations in the loci coding for pro-a 1 and pro-a 2 chains which form the helical structure of collagen 1. Ref:Maheshwari 9th/e p.306",A

"On a return visit after receiving a diagnosis of functional dyspepsia, a 35- year-old woman reports sensations of early satiety and discomfort in the epigastric region after a meal. These symptoms are most likely a result of:",Malfunction of adaptive relaxation in the gastric reservoir,Elevated frequency of contractions in the antral pump,An incompetent lower esophageal sphincter,Premature onset of the interdigestive phase of gastric motility,"Ans. A. Malfunction of adaptive relaxation in the gastric reservoirAs the gastric reservoir fills during a meal, mechanoreceptors signal the CNS. When the limits of adaptive relaxation in the reservoir are reached, signals from the stretch receptors in the reservoir's walls account for the sensations of fullness and satiety. Overdistension is perceived as discomfort. Adaptive relaxation appears to malfunction in the forms of functional dyspepsia characterized by the symptoms described in this question. If adaptive relaxation is compromised (e.g., by an enteric neuropathy), mechanoreceptors are activated at lower distending volumes and the CNS wrongly interprets the signals as if the gastric reservoir were full. None of the other choices would be expected to activate mechanosensory signaling of the state of fullness of the gastric reservoir.",A

Juvenile Papillomatosis of the breast
â It is a relatively common benign localised proliferative lesion in the breast.
â It is mainly seen in young women (mean age: 19-23 years)
â Caused by HPV 6 and 11.
Clinical presentation
â Patients present with a firmt well-defined, mobile mass often in the periphery of the breast.
â There is usually no nipple discharge.
Pathology
â Papillary proliferation of the ductal epithelium which partly fills up smaller ducts causing distension.
â Grossly, well-circumscribed mass containing multiple small cysts (<2 cm) within a dense fibrous stroma
(therefore sometimes termed swiss cheese disease by pathologists).
â Lesions can vary in size, usually ranging from 1 to 8 cm.
Radiographic features
Breast ultrasound
â They can appear as an ill-defined, inhomogenous hypoechoic mass with multiple small (up to 4mm)Â predominantly peripheral cysts.
â Microcalcifications may be seen at sonography.
Mammography
â These lesions are usually negative on mammography.
â Occasionally may show microcalcifications, an asymmetric density or a prominant intraductal pattern.Â 
Galactography
â May show a multiple irregular filling defects within the breasts.Â Breast MRI
Signal characteristics according to one report include

"During surgical stress, which is not seen: March 2011",Increased ACTH,Increased insulin,Increased norepinephrine,Increased GH,"Ans. B: Increased insulinMost of the stressful stimuli that increase ACTH secretion also activate the sympathetic nervous systemAlpha adrenergic stimulators (epinephrine and norepinephrine) inhibits insulin secretionThe condition in which sympathetic nervous system, including the sympatho-adrenal medullary system is activated are: fear, trauma, haemorhhage, fluid loss etc.Stressful stimuli stimulates secretion of growth hormone in humansStress hormonesThey are coisol, GH and norepinephrineThey are released at periods of high stress.Stress hormones rise in the body during any neuroendocrine reaction such as surgery and they remain high as long as 72 hours, after which all these hormones return to their normal level, the last being coisol.Stress hormones act by mobilizing energy from storage to muscles, increasing hea rate, blood pressure and breathing rate and shutting down metabolic processes such as digestion, reproduction, growth and immunity.Stress response to surgeryIt is characterized by increased secretion of pituitary hormones and activation of the sympathetic nervous system.The changes in pituitary secretion have secondary effects on hormone secretion from target organs.For example, release of coicotrophin from the pituitary stimulates coisol secretion from the adrenal coex.Arginine vasopressin is secreted from the posterior pituitary and has effects on the kidney.In the pancreas, glucagon is released and insulin secretion may be diminished.The overall metabolic effect of the hormonal changes is increased catabolism which mobilizes substrates to provide energy sources, and a mechanism to retain salt and water and maintain fluid volume and cardiovascular homeostasis.",B

Damage to the suprascapular and axillary nerves causes impaired abduction and lateral rotation of the arm. Damage to the musculocutaneous nerve causes impaired flexion of the forearm. A winged scapula would be caused by damage to the long thoracic nerve. The long thoracic nerve is formed from spinal cord levels C5, C6, and C7, so the serratus anterior muscle would be weakened from the damage to C5 and C6, but the muscle would not be completely paralyzed. The intrinsic muscles of the hand are innervated by the ulnar nerve, which would most likely remain intact. Paraesthesia in the medial aspect of the arm would be caused by damage to the medial brachial cutaneous nerve (C8-T1; inferior trunk). Loss of sensation on the dorsum of the hand would be caused by damage to either the ulnar or radial nerves (C6 to T1).",B

Increase blood volume Preload (Degree of ventricular filling during diastole)o Cardiac preload is represented by volume of venous blood that distends the ventricle, i.e., venous return determines the preload. An increase in preload, i.e., increase in venous return results in a higher end-diastolic volumeQ (PreloadQ).o This results in stretching of myocardial fiber and this increase in length of myofibril increases the strength of cardiac contraction in accordance with the Frank-Starling law or Starling's law of the hearto According to Starling's lawr, greater the initial length of muscle fiber, greater is the force of contraction,o The initial length of muscle fiber (length of fiber at the initiation of contraction/systole) refers to length of the fiber at the end of the diastole, i.e., end-diastolic fiber length.o Thus, the factors which improve venous return increase the cardiac output by increasing end-diastolic ventricular volume and length, i.e.. preload,o Opposite is true for factors which decrease venous return.| Stroke volume| Stroke volumeFactors Increasing end-diastolic ventricular muscle fiber length (Factors increasing venous return or preload)Factors decreasing end-diastolic ventricular muscle fiber length (Factors decreasing venous return or preload)o Increased total blood volumeQo Decreased total blood volumeo Increased venous toneQo Decreased venous toneo Increased pumping action of skeletal muscleo Decreased pumping action of skeletal muscleso Increased negative intrathoracic pressureQ (e.g. inspiration)o Less negative or positive intrathoracic pressure (expiration)o Sitting or standingQ (venous pooling of blood)o Lying down from sitting or standing position o Sympathatic discharge causing decrease in venous capacitance by decreasing venous compliance",A

Ribosome has which of the following enzymatic activity?,Peptidyl transferase,Peptidase,Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase,GTPase,"The peptidyl transferase is an amino acyltransferase as well as the primary enzymatic function of the ribosome, which forms peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids using tRNAs during the translation process of protein biosynthesis. Peptidyl transferase activity is carried out by the ribosome. Peptidyl transferase activity is not mediated by any ribosomal proteins but by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a ribozyme. Ribozymes are RNA molecules with catalytic activity. These generally involve trans esterification reactions, and most are concerned with RNA metabolism (splicing and endoribonuclease). Recently, a rRNA component has been implicated in hydrolyzing an aminoacyl ester and thus to play a central role in peptide bond function (peptidyl transferases). Ref: Weil P. (2011). Chapter 36.

"In starvation, there is ketosis due to ?",Decreased acetyl CoA,Increased b-oxidation,Decreased lipolysis,Decreased fatty acid,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Increased b-oxidationStarvation is characterized by decreased insulin : glucagon ratio.This causes :?i) Increased lipolysis - More FFAs for ketogenesis.ii) Increased fi-oxidation - Increased ketogenosis.iii) Decreased oxaloacetate - Acetyl CoA is utilized in ketogenesis.Regulation of ketogenesisKetogenesis is regulated at three levels:?1) Factors regulating mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissues (i.e. lipolysis):- Free fatty acids, the precursors of ketone bodies, arise from lipolysis of triglycerides in adipose tissue. Hence, factors which enhance lipolysis (e.g. glucagon) stimulate ketogensis by providing more free fatty acids. Conversely, factors that inhibit lipolysis (e.g. insulin) inbibit ketogenesis.2) Factors regulating b-oxidation of fatty acids:- After uptake by liver, FAAs are either (i) b-oxidized to CO, or ketone bodies, or (ii) esterified to triacylglycerol. Carnitine acetyl transferase-I (CAT-I) regulates the b-oxidation of fatty acid and therefore the production of staing materials of ketogenesis i.e. acetylCoA and acetoacetyl-CoA (The remainder of fatty acids which do not enter b-oxidation, are estesified). Activity of CAT-1 is high in starvation and diabetes leading to increased b-oxidation of fatty acids and increased ketogenesis. CAT-1 activity is low in well fed state, resulting in decreased 13-oxidation and ketogenesis. This regulation is governed by Malonyl CoA, which is an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine acetyl transferase-1: CAT-1 (or carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1: (CPT-1). Malonyl CoA is synthesized by acetyl CoA carboxylase. Activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase is high in well fed state due to increase in insulin/ glucagon ratio, which inturn results in increased formation of malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA inhibits CAT-I (CPT-I) leading to decreased b-oxidation and ketogenesis. Hence, esterification of fatty acids is increased. Conversely, during starvation (and diabetes) insulin/glucagon ratio is decreased which results in decreased activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase and decreased production of malonyl-CoA, releasing the inhibition of CAT-I (CPT-I). This results in increase b-oxidation of fatty acids and ketogenesis.3) Factors regulating the oxidation of acetyl CoA:- The acetyl-CoA formed in b-oxidation is oxidized in the citric acid cycle, or it enters the ketogenesis to form ketone bodies. When oxaloacetate concentration is low, little acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle and ketogenesis is oured (first reaction of TCA cycle inolves oxaloacetate, where it combines with acetyl-CoA to form citrate). Concentration of oxalaceatate is lowered if carbohydrate is unavailable or improperly utilized, e.g. in fasting and in diabetes.",B

"What is the clearance of a substance when its concentration in the plasma is 10 mg/dL, its concentration in urine is 100 mg/dL, and urine flow is 2 mL/min?",2 mL/min,10 mL/min,20 mL/min,200 mL/min,"Ans. c (20 ml/min) (Ref. Ganong physiology, 21st ed., 806)MEASURING GFR# The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be measured in intact experimental animals and humans by measuring the excretion and plasma level of a substance that is freely filtered through the glomeruli and neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the tubules.# The amount of such a substance in the urine per unit of time must have been provided by filtering exactly the number of milliliters of plasma that contained this amount.# Therefore, if the substance is designated by the letter X, the GFR is equal to the concentration of X in urine (UX) times the urine flow per unit of time (V.) divided by the arterial plasma level of X (PX), or UXV/PX. This value is called the clearance of X (CX).In our MCQ, the clearance will be Cx=100 x 2/ 10 = 20 ml/min.# PX is, of course, the same in all parts of the arterial circulation, and if X is not metabolized to any extent in the tissues, the level of X in peripheral venous plasma can be substituted for the arterial plasma level.SUBSTANCES USED TO MEASURE GFR# In addition to the requirement that it be freely filtered and neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a substance suitable for measuring the GFR should be nontoxic and not metabolized by the body.# Inulin, a polymer of fructose with a molecular weight of 5200 that is found in dahlia tubers, meets these criteria in humans and most animals and is extensively used to measure GFR.UIN = 35 mg/mLV = 0.9 mL/minPIN = 0.25 mg/mLCIN = UINV----PIN=35 x 0.9------0.25CIN = 126 mL/min# Endogenous creatinine clearance is easy to measure and is a worthwhile index of renal function.# Normal GFR- The GFR in an average-sized normal man is approximately 125 mL/min.- Its magnitude correlates fairly well with surface area, but values in women are 10% lower than those in men even after correction for surface area.- A rate of 125 mL/min is 7.5 L/h, or 180 L/d, whereas the normal urine volume is about 1 L/d. Thus, 99% or more of the filtrate is normally reabsorbed.- At the rate of 125 mL/min, the kidneys filter in 1 day an amount of fluid equal to 4 times the total body water, 15 times the ECF volume, and 60 times the plasma volume.# Control of GFR- The factors governing filtration across the glomerular capillaries are the same as those governing filtration across all other capillaries, i.e.,# The size of the capillary bed,# The permeability of the capillaries, and# The hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients across the capillary wall.# For each nephron:- GFR = Kf [(PGC-PT)-(nGC-nT)# Kf, the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, is the product of the glomerular capillary wall hydraulic conductivity (ie, its permeability) and the effective filtration surface area.# PGC is the mean hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries,# PT the mean hydrostatic pressure in the tubule,# pGC osmotic pressure of the plasma in the glomerular capillaries, and# pT the osmotic pressure of the filtrate in the tubule.",C

Blood agar is an example of: March 2010,Enrichment media,Enriched media,Selective media,Transpo media,"Ans. B: Enriched media A growth medium is considered differential if, when specific microbes are present, the medium or bacterial colonies themselves exhibit a color change that provides information about their identity. Blood agar (BAP) is a differential growth medium which is used to distinguish clinically significant bacteria from throat and sputum cultures. BAP contains 5% sheep blood. Ceain bacteria produce enzymes (hemolysins) that act on the red blood cells to lyse or break them down. Beta hemolysis means that the bacteria's hemolytic enzymes completely beak down the blood cells. The a-hemolysis pattern results in the media displaying clear halos around bacterial colonies. Alpha hemolysis (a-hemolysis) means that the bacterial enzymes only paially break down the blood cells. This results in the media showing a yellowish/greenish/brownish discoloration (like a bruise) around the colony, indicating incomplete hemolysis. Gamma hemolysis is essentially no hemolysis at all. The bacteria have no effect on the red blood cells, and there is no change to the color of the medium. Some of the terms for media are interchangeable. For example, the blood agar medium is an enriched medium but bacteria lysing red cells show a clearing around their colonies. Thus, it is an differential medium as well.",B

Concentration of ions

Na+ concentration higher in ECF
K+ concentration higher in ICF
Cl- concentration higher in ECF
K+ leak channels allow K+ to move from ICF to ECF
Na+ is prevented from entering to the cell.
Inside the cell, negativity is higher because Na+K+ pump pushes out 3 Na+ while taking in 2 K+.
K+ leaks to ECF, along the concentration gradient, until the electrical gradient prevents further leak (inside the cell is more negative compared to ECF). So electrical gradient wants to pull positive charges towards ICF while concentration gradient wants to pull K+ towards ECF. This brings a balance in movement of K+.

Now, if the concentration of K+ in ECF is increased

The concentration gradient of K+ is decreased.
Less leaking of K+ from ICF to ECF.

Which of the following inhibits gastric phase of gastric secretion: March 2011,Amino acids in stomach,Vagus effect,Distension of the stomach,Low gastric pH,"Ans. D: Low gastric pHFood in the stomach increase gastric acid secretion by stretching the receptors in the wall of the stomach (mechanical stimulus) The fibers from the receptor enter Meissner's plexus (site of ganglion cells of vagus nerve)Products of digestion (specially amino acids) in the stomach also stimulates gastric mucosa (chemical stimulus)Gastric secretionGastric acid is produced by parietal cells (also called oxyntic cells) in the stomach. There are three phases in the secretion of gastric acid:The cephalic phase: Thiy percent of the total gastric acid secretions to be produced is stimulated by anticipation of eating and the smell or taste of foodThe gastric phase: Sixty percent of the acid secreted is stimulated by the distention of the stomach with food. Plus, digestion produces proteins, which causes even more gastrin productionThe intestinal phase: The remaining 10% of acid is secreted when chyme enters the small intestine, and is stimulated by small intestine distention.Regulation of secretionGastric acid production is regulated by both the autonomic nervous system and several hormones.The parasympathetic nervous system, the vagus nerve, and the hormone gastrin stimulate the parietal cell to produce gastric acid, both directly acting on parietal cells and indirectly, through the stimulation of the secretion of the hormone histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells (ECL).Vasoactive intestinal peptide, cholecystokinin, and secretin all inhibit production.The production of gastric acid in the stomach is tightly regulated by positive regulators and negative feedback mechanisms.Four types of cells are involved in this process: parietal cells, G cells, D cells and enterochromaffine-like cells.Besides this, the endings of the vagus nerve (CN X) and the intramural nervous plexus in the digestive tract influence the secretion significantly.Nerve endings in the stomach secrete two stimulatory neurotransmitters: acetylcholine and gastrin-releasing peptide. Their action is both direct on parietal cells and mediated through the secretion of gastrin from G cells and histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells.Gastrin acts on parietal cells directly and indirectly too, by stimulating the release of histamine.The release of histamine is the most impoant positive regulation mechanism of the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach.Its release is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine and inhibited by somatostatin.",D

Nucleosome core protein is made up of,DNA,RNA,Histones,None.,"NucleosomesNucleosomes are primary structural units of chromatin. It consists of DNA bound to protein histones, i.e. core of protein histones wrapped with DNA. Histones are basic proteins rich in lysine and argininine. These positively charged amino acids interact with negatively charged phosphate group of DNA. There are five types of histones til, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Two molecules of each H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 associate one another to form histone octomer. Around histone octomer a segment of the DNA helix is wound nearly twice forming nucleosome core. A nucleosome associated with histone Hl is called chromatosome.A series of nucleosome ('beads on a string') form a polynucleosome or chromatin. The DNA connecting two nucleosomes is called linker (or spacer) DNA. To linker DNA, H1 histone is attached to stabilize the complex. Non-histone proteins are also attached to linker DNA.

About H. Influenza all true except aEUR',Requires factor X and V for growth,Rarely presents as meningitis in children less than 2 months of age,Capsular polypeptide protein is responsible for virulence,M.0 invasive disease of H influenza is meningitis,"Capsular polypeptide protein is responsible for virulence Hemophilus Infl uenzae Hemophilus influenzae is a grain negative rod. The name hemophilus influenzae shows some of its features. Hemophilus means 'blood loving' This organism requires blood containing medium.for growth H. influenzae requires 2 erythrocyte factors for growth. Factor X hemin --> It is required, for synthesis of cytochrome Factor V nicotinanti- --> It is essential for oxidation de adenine dinucleotide reduction In the laboratory it is usually grown on chocolate blood agar which is prepared by adding blood to an agar base at 80degC. The heat releases X and V factors from the RBC and turn the medium a chocolate brown colour. Pathogenesis :? The pathogenesis of H. influenzae infection is not completely understood although the presence of type B polysaccharids capsule is known to be the major factor in virulence. H. influenzae does not secrete any exotoxins, the polysaccharide capsule is considered to be the major factor in virulence. -There are '6' types of capsule designated a, b, c, d, e and f of these type 'b' is conunonly associated with invasive Hemophilus influaenzae disease in children. The polysaccharide capsule of type 'b' strain is composed of ribose ribitol and phosphate '(PRP)' capsule and is the proven determinance of virulence. The 'PRP capsule' exes its effect in the following way :? It is antiphagocytic It does not induce the alternative complement pathway This allows the bacterium to invade the blood or cerebrospinal .fluid without attracting phagocytes or provoking an inflammatory response and complement mediated bacteriolysis. For this reason anticapsular antibody which promotes both phagocytosis and lysis of bacteria is the main factor in immune defense against H. influenzae infection. Non typable or nonencapsulated strains of bacteria are less virulent. They lack the invasiveness of their capsulated strains and can only cause local reactions. They frequently cause otitis media in children as well as respiratory disease in adults weakned by preexisting lung disease such as chronic bronchitis from smoking or recent viral influenza infection. Hemophilus influenzae is associated with two types of infection -Invasive infections - Non invasive infections Host defenses Host defenses include the :- - Activation of the alternative and classical complement pathways and - Antibodies to the PRP capsule H. influenzae is susceptible to lysis by antibody and complement. Antibodies to the Hib capsule plays the primary role in conferring immunity against H. influenzae. These bactericidal antibody directed against PRP capsule of H. influenzae type h is entirely responsible for host resistance. Newborns have low risk of infection The mother possesses antibodies against the 'b' capsule which she has acquired in her life time. She passes these antibodies to the fetus transplacentally and in her breast milk. These passively acquired antibodies last for about 6 months as a result infants are immune to H Influenzae infections. When these transplacental antibodies to the capsule wane infants are at high risk for developing invasive H. influenzae disease. It takes 3-5 years of hemophilus influenzae colonization and infection for children to develop their own antibodies. So there is a 'window' during which children are prone to be infected with hemophilus influenzae.",C

Which time points (W-Z) on the Cheyne-Stokes breathing graph are associated with the highest pCO2 of lung blood and highest pCO2 of the neurons in the respiratory centre?,Lung Blood Respiratory Centre X Y,`Lung Blood Respiratory Centre Y Z,Lung Blood Respiratory Centre Z W,Lung Blood Respiratory Centre W X,"Cheyne Stokesbreathing : When a person over-breathes, thus blowing off too much CO2 from the pulmonary blood while at the same time increasing blood O2, it takes several seconds before the changed pulmonary blood can be transpoed to the brain and inhibit the excess ventilation. By this time, the person has already over ventilated for an extra few seconds. Therefore, when the over ventilated blood finally reaches the brain respiratory centre, the centre becomes depressed to an excessive amount, at which point the opposite cycle begins--that is, CO2 increases and O2 decreases in the alveoli. Again, it takes a few seconds before the brain can respond to these new changes. When the brain does respond, the person breathes hard once again and the cycle repeats. Z: point after which respiration will sta as shown in graph. Due to apnoea till this point the PCO2 will become maximum in the lungs W: maximum excitement of respiratory centre due to maximum PCO2 in brain",C

Which of the following helps in generating reactive oxygen intermediate in the neutrophil,NADPH oxidase,SOD (superoxide dismutase),Catalase,Glutathione peroxidase,"Ref Robbins 9/e p79 Killing and Degradation of Phagocytosed Microbes. The culmination of the phagocytosis of microbes is killing and degradation of the ingested paicles. The key steps in this reaction are the production of microbicidal substances within lysosomes and fusion of the lysosomes with phago- somes, thus exposing the ingested paicles to the destruc- tive mechanisms of the leukocytes (Fig. 2-8). The most impoant microbicidal substances are reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lysosomal enzymes. The production of ROS involves the following steps: * Phagocytosis and the engagement of various cellular receptors stimulate an oxidative burst, also called the respiratory burst, which is characterized by a rapid increase in oxygen consumption, glycogen catabolism (glycogenolysis), increased glucose oxidation, and production of ROS. The generation of the oxygen metabolites is due to rapid activation of a leukocyte NADPH oxidase, called the phagocyte oxidase, which oxi- dizes NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleo- tide phosphate) and, in the process, conves oxygen to superoxide ion (O2 * ) (see Fig. 1-18, B, Chapter 1). * Superoxide is then conveed by spontaneous dismuta- tion into hydrogen peroxide (O2 * + 2H+ - H2O2). These ROS act as free radicals and destroy microbes by mecha- nisms that were described in Chapter 1. * The quantities of H2O2 produced generally are insuffi- cient to kill most bacteria (although superoxide and hydroxyl radical formation may be sufficient to do so). However, the lysosomes of neutrophils (called azuro- philic granules) contain the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), and in the presence of a halide such as Cl- , MPO conves H2O2 to HOCl* (hypochlorous radical). HOCl* is a powerful oxidant and antimicrobial agent (NaOCl is the active ingredient in chlorine bleach) that kills bacteria by halogenation, or by protein and lipid peroxidation. Founately, the phagocyte oxidase is active only after its cytosolic subunit translocates to the membrane of the pha- golysosome; thus, the reactive end products are generated mainly within the vesicles, and the phagocyte itself is not damaged. H2O2 is eventually broken down to water and O2 by the actions of catalase, and the other ROS also are degraded (Chapter 1). Reactive nitrogen species, paicu- larly nitric oxide (NO), act in the same way as that described for ROS.",A

B: AFB The diagnosis of tuberculosis requires detection of acid-fast bacilli in sputum the Ziehl-Neelsen method Mycobacteria retains the primary stain even after exposure to decolorising acid-alcohol, hence the term 'acid-fast'. A counter-stain is employed to highlight the stained organisms for easier recognition. There are several methods of determining the acid-fast nature of mycobacteria. In the carbolfuchsin (Ziehl-Neelsen) procedure, acid-fast organisms appear red against a blue background, while in the fluorochrome procedures (auramine-O, auramine-rhodamine), the acid-fast organisms appear as fluorescent rods, yellow to orange (the colour may vary with the filter system used) against a paler yellow or orange background. Tuberculin testing may be used as an aid in diagnosing active infection in infants and young children,to measure prevalence of infection in an area, to select susceptible or as an indication of successful vaccination.",B
Which of the following hormone is related to appetite and satiety?,Leptin,Peptide YY(PYY),Ghrelin,All of the above.,"Ans. D. All of the above. (Ref. H-17th/pg. 255, 2557, 464; Fig. 74-2; Guyton 11th/pg. 870; Fig. 71-1)Activation of the POMC neurons decreases food intake and increases energy expenditure, whereas activation of the NPY-AGRP neurons increases food intake and reduces energy expenditure, these neurons are major targets for the actions of several hormones that regulate appetite, including leptin, insulin, CCK, and ghrelin.There are two distinct types of neurons in the arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus that are especially important as controllers of both appetite and energy expenditure: (1) pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons that produce a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH) together with cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript (CART), and (2) neurons that produce the orexigenic substances neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AGRP).NT and hormones influencing feeding and satiety centres in hypothalamusAnorexingenic (decrease feeding)Orexigenic (increase feeding)# Alpha-MSH# Neuropeptide Y (NPY)# Leptin# Agouti-related protein (AGRP)# Serotonin# Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)# Norepinephrine# Orexins A and B# CRH# Endorphins# Insulin# Galanin (GAL)# CCK# Amino acids (glutamate & GABA)# Glucagon like ppetide# Cortisol# Cocaine and amphetamine regulatd transcript (CART)# Ghrelin# Peptide YY(PYY) Ghrelin# Ghrelin is a hormone released mainly by the oxyntic cells of the stomach but also, to a much less extent, by the intestine.# Blood levels of ghrelin rise during fasting, peak just before eating, and then fall rapidly after a meal, suggesting a possible role in stimulating feeding.# Also, administration of ghrelin increases food intake in experimental animals, further supporting the possibility that it may be an orexigenic hormone.Leptin:# hypothalamus senses energy storage through the actions of leptin, a peptide hormone released from adipocytes. Leptin circulates to the brain, where it moves across the BBB by facilitated diffusion and occupies leptin receptors at multiple sites in the hypothalamus, especially the POMC neurons of the arcuate nuclei and neurons of the paraventricular nuclei. Stimulation of leptin receptors in these hypothalamic nuclei initiates multiple actions that decrease fat storage, including: (l).decreased production in the hypothalamus of appetite stimulators, such as NPY and AGRP; (2) activation of POMC neurons, causing release of a-MSH and activation of melanocortin receptors; (3) increased production in the hypothalamus of substances, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone, that decrease food intake; (4) increased sympathetic nerve activity (through neural projections from the hypothalamus to the vasomotor centers), which increases metabolic rate and energy expenditure; and (5) decreased insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cells, which decreases energy storage. Thus. leptin mav be an important means bv which the adipose tissue signals the brain that enough energy has been stored and that intake of food is no longer necessary.Peptide YY(PYY)# Peptide YY (PYY) is secreted from the entire GIT, but especially from the ileum and colon. Food intake stimulates release of PYY, with blood concentrations rising to peak levels 1 to 2 hours after ingesting a meal. These peak levels of PYY are influenced by the number of calories ingested and the composition of the food, with higher levels of PYY observed after meals with a high fat content. Although injections of PYY into mice have been shown to decrease food intake for 12 hours or more, the importance of this Gl hormone in regulating appetite in humans is still unclear.

Most common cause of Traveller's diarrhoea:,Enterotoxigenic E. coli,Enterohemorrhagic E. coli,Enteropathogenic E. coli,Enteroinvasive E. coli,"ETEC are the most impoant cause of traveler's diarrhea in visitors to developing countries. ETEC also produce diarrhea in infants native to these countries, where they are a leading cause of morbidity and moality during the first 2 years of life. Repeated bouts of diarrhea caused by ETEC and other infectious agents are an impoant cause of growth retardation, malnutrition, and developmental delay in third-world countries where ETEC are endemic. ETEC disease is rare in industrialized nations, although recent outbreaks suggest that it may be underestimated. Also Know: Transmission is by consumption of food and water contaminated by infected human or convalescent carriers. ETEC diarrhea is caused by strains of E coli that produce LT and/or ST enterotoxins in the proximal small intestine. Strains that elaborate both LT and ST cause more severe illness. Adherence to surface microvilli mediated by the colonizing factor (CF) pili is essential for the efficient delivery of toxin to the target enterocytes.LT and/or ST cause fluid outpouring in small intestine. Infections with ETEC can stimulate immunity. This natural immunity is presumably mediated by sIgA specific for LT and CFs. Ref: Ray C.G., Ryan K.J. (2010). Chapter 33. Enterobacteriaceae. In C.G.

"A 1-year-old child, on a routine well child visit, was discovered to have cataract formation in both eyes. Blood test demonstrated elevated galactose and galactitol levels. In order to determine which enzyme might be defective in the child, which intracellular metabolite should be measured?",Galactose,Fructose,Glucose,Galactose-1-phosphate,"The child has a form of galactosemia. The elevated galactose enters the lens of the eye, is reduced to galactitol, and is trapped. The difference in osmotic pressure across the lens of the eye leads to cataract formation. Galactose is phosphorylated by galactokinase to galactose-1-phosphate, which reacts with UDP-glucose in a reaction catalyzed by galactose-1-phosphate uridylyl transferase to form UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate. An epimerase converts UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose. Deficiencies in either galactokinase (nonclassical) or galactose-1-phosphate uridylyl transferase (classical) result in galactosemia, with elevated levels of galactose and galactitol (reduced galactose) in the blood. An intracellular measurement of galactose-1-phosphate can allow a definitive diagnosis to be obtained (such levels would be nonexistent if the defect were in galactokinase, and the levels would be greatly elevated if the galactose-1-phosphate uridylyl transferase enzyme were defective).",D

mRNA codes for which tail?,Poly A,Poly U,Poly C,Poly G,"Polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(A) tail to a messenger RNA. The poly(A) tail consists of multiple adenosine monophosphates; in other words, it is a stretch of RNA that has only adenine bases. In eukaryotes, polyadenylation is pa of the process that produces mature messenger RNA(mRNA) for translation. It, therefore, forms pa of the larger process of gene expression. The process of polyadenylation begins as the transcription of a gene terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off by a set of proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes, these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative splicing. Ref satyanarayana 4e",A

"As a pa of a research, a person undergoes two fine needle muscle biopsies to obtain small amounts of tissue for biochemical analysis. The first is taken at the beginning of the experiment while the subject is at rest. The second is taken at the end of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on a stationary bicycle. The activity of the muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes is found to be much higher in the second measurement. Which of the following biochemical changes would be most likely to produce this effect?",Decreased ADP,Decreased intracellular Ca2+,Increased acetyl CoA,Increased pyruvate concentration,"In most biochemical pathways, only one to a few enzymatic reactions are under regulatory control. These often occur either at the beginning of pathways or at pathway branch points. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex controls the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, and decarboxylates pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) with production of NADH and acetyl CoA (the substrate for the citric acid cycle). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in mitochondria is huge, visible as dots by electron microscopy, because it is composed of many copies of at least 5 separate enzymes. Three of these (pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, and dihydrolipoate dehydrogenase) perform the actual biochemical reactions. The other two, PDH kinase and phosphatase, add or remove phosphate groups from the PDH complex, respectively. The more active form of PDH is not phosphorylated; the less active form is. In exercise, high ADP and pyruvate concentrations inhibit PDH kinase, while increased Ca2+ stimulates PDH phosphatase. Both effects produce more of the dephosphorylated, more active form of PDH. A higher, not decreased, concentration of ADP (choice Decreased ADP) is seen with exercise and tends to turn PDH on. Intracellular calcium (choice Decreased intracellular Ca2+) is increased, not decreased, with exercise and tends to turn PDH on. Increased acetyl CoA (choice Increased acetyl CoA), as seen in active lipolysis, tends to turn PDH off.",D

Major initiating response for peristalsis is,Hormonal,Local stretching of gut,Neural,None.,"Peristalsis is a reflex response that is initiated when the gut wall is stretched by the contents of the lumen, and it occurs in all pas of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum. The stretch initiates a circular contraction behind the stimulus and an area of relaxation in front of it. The wave of contraction then moves in an oral-to-caudal direction, propelling the contents of the lumen forward at rates that vary from 2 to 25 cm/s. Peristaltic activity can be increased or decreased by the autonomic input to the gut, but its occurrence is independent of the extrinsic innervation. Indeed, progression of the contents is not blocked by removal and resuture of a segment of intestine in its original position and is blocked only if the segment is reversed before it is sewn back into place. Peristalsis is an excellent example of the integrated activity of the enteric nervous system. It appears that local stretch releases serotonin, which activates sensory neurons that activate the myenteric plexus. Cholinergic neurons passing in a retrograde direction in this plexus activate neurons that release substance P and acetylcholine, causing smooth muscle contraction. At the same time, cholinergic neurons passing in an anterograde direction activate neurons that secrete NO, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), producing the relaxation ahead of the stimulus.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMAN, TWENTY-THIRD EDITION, PAGE NO:469,470",B

Pancreatic secretion is almost identical in its function with the a-amylase of saliva but is several times more powerful.* Hence, within 15 to 30 minutes after the chyme empties from the stomach into the duodenum and mixes with pancreatic juice, nearly all the carbohydrates will have become digested.",B
Which of the following occurs in the lipidosis known as Tay-Sachs disease?,Synthesis of a specific ganglioside is excessive,Xanthomas due to cholesterol deposition are observed,Phosphoglycerides accumulate in the brain,Ganglioside GM2 is not catabolized by lysosomal enzymes,"In the genetic disorder known as Tay-Sachs disease, ganglioside GM2 is not catabolized. As a consequence, the ganglioside concentration is elevated many times higher than normal. The functionally absent lysosomal enzyme is b-N- acetylhexosaminidase. The elevated GM2 results in irreversible brain damage to infants, who usually die before the age of 3 years. Under normal conditions, this enzyme cleaves N- acetylgalactosamine from the oligosaccharide chain of this complex sphingolipid, allowing fuher catabolism to occur. The cause of most lipidoses (lipid storage diseases) is similar. That is, a defect in catabolism of gangliosides causes abnormal accumulation. None of the other choices result in lipidotic disorders.

"Molecular interaction, found in the structure of DNA-",Hydrogen bond,Glycosidic bond,Covalent interactions,All of the above,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., All of the aboveo Bonds involved in DNA structure are -i) With in nucleotides : Glycosidic bond between carbon-1 of pentose sugar (deoxyribose) and nitrogen-9 of purine base or nitrogen-1 of pyrimidine base.ii) Between two strands of DNA ; The two chains (strands) are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary pairs of bases. Adenine is always paired with thymine by formation of two hydrogen bonds and Guanine is always paired with cytosine by formation of three hydrogen bonds.Between suecesive nucleotides : Successive nucleotides in a strand of DNA are attached to each other by 51-31 phosphodiester bonds. Carbon-31 and -51 of deoxyribose subunits are involved in ester linkages with an inorganic phosphate to form a 31, 51 phosphodiester bond (a covalent bond). Thus alternating phosphate and deoxy ribose units form the backbone structure of DNA while purine and pyrimidine bases are stacked inside.Base-staking interactions : The bases (purines and pyrimidines) lie flat in the interior, stacked on top of one another. They interact with one another through vander waals forces and hydrophobic interactions. Collectively these two are known as base-stacking interactions.",D

Other modes of injury of the common peroneal nerve may be compression caused by a tight plaster on leg and sometimes due to lathi injury on lateral side of the knee. Common peroneal nerve is divided into deep peroneal nerve and superficial peroneal nerve. Deep peroneal nerve supply muscles of anterior compament of leg which include tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus teius and extensor hallucis longus whereas superficial peroneal nerve supply muscles of lateral compament of the leg i.e peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. In the common peroneal nerve injury the muscles of the anterior and lateral compament of the leg get paralysed results in weakness of dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot. As there is weakness of the dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot, the opposite muscles, the plantar flexion of the ankle joint and inversion of subtalar and transverse tarsal joint, cause the foot to be plantar flexed. So the planter flexion and inversion are normal. The patient has a high stepping gait. All the reflexes are intact (ankle jerk is lost in sciatic nerve lesions) Sensory loss is present over anterior and lateral side of the leg, dorsum of the foot and toes including medial side of the big toe. Sole of the foot derives its sensory innervation from medial calcaneal branch of tibial nerve and branches from medial and lateral plantar nerves so there is no loss of sensations in the foot.",C

The first lipoprotein to increase in concentration in the blood after ingestion of 400 g of jellybeans (carbohydrate) is,Chylomicrons,VLDL,LDL,HDL,"VLDL is synthesized in the liver, particularly after a high carbohydrate meal. It is formed from triacylglycerols that are packaged with cholesterol, apolipoproteins (particularly, apoB-100), and phospholipids, and it is released into the blood, where it acquires apoC-II and apo E.VLDL is synthesized by the liver from dietary sugar (present in jelly-beans). LDL is the cholesterol-rich particle in the blood. Cells take up LDL by LDL binding to the LDL receptor, and the LDL-LDL receptor complex enters the cell via endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the cholesterol is released from cholesterol esters by a lysosomal enzyme and enters the cytoplasm of the cell for further processing. Chylomicrons are produced from dietary lipids and cholesterol in the intestinal epithelial cells. HDL is involved in reverse cholesterol transport, which requires the LCAT reaction. Fatty acids, because they are so hydrophobic, cannot travel freely in the blood and need to be bound to albumin for transport through the circulatory system.",B

"A group of elementary school-age children meet for a birthday party, and in the next few days, about half of them experience a mild upper respiratory illness, with sore throat and runny nose. One family gets laboratory work done and finds that Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR) is involved. Which of the following procedures would be best if the laboratory wanted to isolate this bacterium?",Cold agglutinin test,Culture of respiratory secretions in HeLa cells after centrifugation of the inoculated tubes,Culture of respiratory secretions on monkey kidney cells,Detection of specific antigen in urine,"Atypical pneumonia' is an old classification used for respiratory disease that is not lobar and is not 'typical.' That is, it does not include pneumonia caused by pneumococcus, Klebsiella, Haemophilus, or b-hemolytic streptococci that results in a typical lobular infiltrate. In recent years, the atypical pneumonias have become much more frequent than pneumococcal pneumonia. They are characterized by a slower onset with headache, joint pain, fever, and signs of an acute upper respiratory infection. There are usually no signs of acute respiratory distress, but patients report malaise and fatigue. The most common cause of atypical pneumonia is M. pneumoniae. A quick test for M. pneumoniae infection is cold agglutinins. The test may lack both sensitivity and specificity, but it is rapid and readily available compared with culture of M. pneumoniae or specific antibody formation.In certain age groups (men over 55 years old), Legionnaires disease must be ruled out. While direct microscopy, culture, and serology are available, the detection of Legionella antigen in respiratory secretions is the most sensitive test available.Campylobacter pneumoniae may also cause respiratory infection particularly in, but not limited to, children. Diagnosis is best made by growing these energy-defective bacteria in tissue culture such as HeLa cells. Serology is usually not helpful.During the winter months, Bordetella infection may be quite prevalent, particularly in those patients whose immunizations are not updated. Adult Bordetella infection may not present with typical whooping cough symptoms and must be differentiated from other forms of acute bronchitis by culture on specific media or direct fluorescent microscopy.Direct microscopy of sputum is an important preliminary test for sputum and other exudate specimens. One needs to be aware that the information obtained is limited in interpretation. No specific identity of a microorganism can be determined by gram staining and even mixtures of bacteria can be inferred. On the other hand, examination of gram stains may provide enough information for the physician to make immediate decisions on treatment and other management that may be modified by future laboratory results. Fluorescent Ab detection of an organism in sputum is more specific than gram staining. Here specific known Abs (single or in a mixture) are used to identify organisms present.",B
"In the fasting state, glucose is obtained from",Liver glycogen,Myuscle glycogen,Both,None.,"Functions of Glycogen - 1)Glycogen is the storage form of carbohydrates in the human body. The major sites of storage are liver and muscle. The major function of liver glycogen is to provide glucose during fasting. The glycogen content of liver (10 gm/100 gm tissue) is more than in the skeletal muscle (1-2 gm/100 gm). But the total quantity of muscle glycogen is more than liver glycogen because of the larger muscle mass. 2. When blood glucose level falls, liver glycogen is broken down and helps to maintain blood glucose level. After taking food, blood glucose tends to rise, which causes glycogen deposition in liver. About 5 hours after taking food, the blood glucose tends to fall. But, glycogen is lysed to glucose so that the energy needs are met. After about 18 hours fasting, most of the liver glycogen is depleted, when depot fats are hydrolysed and energy requirement is met by fatty acid oxidation. 3. The function of muscle glycogen is to act as reserve fuel for muscle contraction. 4. All the enzymes related to glycogen metabolism are cytoplasmic.

The second arch grows caudally and, ultimately, covers the third and fourth arches. The buried clefts become ectoderm-lined cavities that normally involute. Occasionally this process is arrested and the entrapped remnant forms an epithelium-lined cyst, in some cases with a sinus tract to the overlying skin. (2) Many branchial cleft cysts are asymptomatic; others may become tender, enlarged, or inflamed, or they may develop abscesses that rupture, resulting in a purulent draining sinus to the skin or pharynx. Surgery is indicated in these cases.",A

The part of urinary bladder that shows non-keratinizing squamous metaplasia in adult females?,Anterior wall,Urethral orifice,Trigone,Ureteral orifice,"Ans. c (Trigone) (Ref. Smith's urology, p. 266)Nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia (Trigonitis) is the squamous metaplastic changes that occur in the trigone of the bladder, almost exclusively in women of childbearing age (almost nonexistent in children).Trigonal nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia# The trigone of the bladder (as well as the ureters) are embryologically derived from the mesonephric duct primordial.# Mucosal lining, with the exception of trigone, is rugose in undistended organ but smoothens as filling proceeds.# Normally, trigone is covered in relatively impermeable transitional epithelium. In young females, there may be an overgrowth of squamous vaginal-type epithelium, often referred to as trigonitis. Trigonitis is incorrect terminology because no associated inflammatory reaction exists, and this condition is referred to more properly as trigonal nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia.# The keratinizing variant frequently is associated with chronic irritation secondary to indwelling instrumentation, calculi, or, in endemic areas, Schistosoma haematobium infection.",C

Glucose is conveed to sorbitol by,Aldolase B,Aldose reductase,Sorbitol Dehydrogenase,UDP galactose 4 epimerase,"In lens, the enzyme aldose reductase reduces monosaccharides to corresponding sugar alcohols; glucose to sorbitol and galactose to galactitol. POLYOL PATHWAY OF GLUCOSE - Sorbitol is very poorly absorbed from intestine. It involves the reduction of glucose by aldose reductase to sorbitol, which can then be oxidized to fructose. This would amount to the interconversion of glucose to fructose. Glucose when conveed to sorbitol, cannot diffuse out of the cell easily and gets trapped there. Sorbitol is normally present in lens of eyes. But in diabetes mellitus, when glucose level is high, the sorbitol concentration also increases in the lens. This leads to osmotic damage of the tissue and development of cataract. Galactitol also causes cataract. REF: DM VASUDEVAN TEXTBOOK OF BIOCHEMISTRY, SIXTH EDITION, PG.NO.,119,588.",B

The genus Neisseria contains two impoant human pathogens - N. gonorrhoea - N. meningitides Neisseria gonorrhoea causes gonorrhoea and Neisseria meningitides causes meningitis. Neisseria gonorrhoea infections have a high prevalence and low moality where as N. meningitides infections have low prevalence and high moality. Many Neisseria species are a pa of normal flora in humans and animals. Neisseria meningitides .frequently occurs in a carrier state in the absence of any disease. However, Neisseria Gonorrhoea is an 'obligate pathogen' and is never pa of the normal human flora under any circumstances. Gonococci is exclusive to humans Gonorrhoea is an exclusive human disease, there being no natural infection in animals. The only source of infection is a human carrier or less often a patient. In women gonococcus usually cause asymptomatic infection wheras in men the infection is usually symptomatic. Clinical features of Gonococcal infection:- Neisseria Gonorrhoea infection is acquired by sexual contacts and usually affects the mucous membrane of the urethra in males and endocervix and urethra in females. They mainly affect the host's columnar or cuboidal epithelium. - The vaginal mucosa is usually not affected in the adults because the stratified squamous epithelium is resistant to infection by the cocci and also because of the acid pH of vaginal secretions. Clinical disease as a rule is less severe in females. - In women gonococcus usually cause 'asymptomatic infection' the existence of asymptomatic carriage in women makes them a reservoir serving to perpetuate infection among their male contacts. Gonococcal infection in men is usually 'symptomatic'. - In men the disease stas as an acute urethritis. PID - 1f gonococcal infections are asymptomatic or unrecognized may progress to P.1.D.

In what form do proteins cross the mitochondrial membranes?,Bound to an impoin protein a signal sequence,In fully folded form,In unfolded extended form attached to Hsp 70 chaperones,In unfolded extended form without chaperones,"Mitochondrial proteins are not folded when they are synthesized in the cytosol. Instead, they are attached to Hsp 70 chaperone proteins which hold them in extended form for delivery to the mitochondria. On reaching the mitochondria the protein binds to an outer membrane translocase (TOM) protein. This binding is helped by Hsp70, but as the protein translocates across the membrane the chaperones are removed and do not enter the mitochondrion. Proteins transpoed to the matrix or inner membrane are passed straight from the TOM translocase to an inner membrane translocase (TIM) which transfers them, still in extended form, to the matrix, and to the inner membrane. In the matrix, they are finally folded by mitochondrial chaperones and chaperonins. Reference: Harper; 30th edition",D

"A 23-year-old man is admitted to the emergency department after injuring his knee while playing football. During physical examination there is pain and swelling of the knee, in addition to locking of the knee. Radiographic examination reveals a bucket-handle meniscal tear. Which of the following ligaments is most likely injured?",Posterior cruciate,Medial collateral,Lateral collateral,Anterior cruciate,"(d) Source: GAS 559, 576-577, 583, 646-647; GA 303-305 Both the medial and lateral menisci are subject to rotational injuries and may be torn. The medial meniscus is much more liable to injury because it is attached to the fused deep layer of the medial collateral ligament and joint capsule. The lateral meniscus is separated from the fibular collateral ligament and is external to the capsule of the knee joint. Commonly seen in football players' knees, meniscal tears are usually diagnosed by MRI or by arthroscopy. The presenting symptoms of tearing may be pain and swelling, or locking of the knee. Locking of the knee suggests a bucket-handle tear, in which a partly detached cartilage wedges between the tibia and femur, inhibiting further movement. A bucket-handle tear is often associated with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. Sometimes a momentary click can be heard in flexion/extension movements of the knee. Meniscectomy is a successful operation, but currently there is greater emphasis on repairing small tears. Meniscal cysts can form secondary to meniscal tears and some of these can also be treated arthroscopically.",D

"A 34-year-old female has a history of intermittent episodes of severe abdominal pain. She has had multiple abdominal surgeries and exploratory procedures with no abnormal findings. Her urine appears dark during an attack and gets even darker if exposed to sunlight. The attacks seem to peak after she takes erythromycin, because of her penicillin allergy. This patient most likely has difficulty in synthesizing which one of the following?",Heme,Creatine phosphate,Cysteine,Thymine,"The patient has acute intermittent porphyria, which is a defect in one of the early steps leading to heme synthesis. The buildup of the intermediate that cannot continue along the pathway leads to the dark urine, and it turns darker when ultraviolet (UV) light interacts with the conjugated double bonds in the molecule. Erythromycin is metabolized through an induced P450 system, which requires increased heme synthesis. This leads to metabolite buildup to the level where the abdominal pain appears. The defect in heme synthesis does not affect creatine phosphate, cysteine, thymine, or methionine levels.",A
Number of ATP generated in one TCA cycle-,2,5,10,11,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 10 o In a single TCA cycle 10 molecules of ATP are produced (12 molecules according to older calculations),o One turn of the TCA cycle, starting with acetyl Co A produces 10 ATPs. When the starting molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2.5 ATPs and therefore, 12.5 ATPs are produced when starting compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle,o Note : Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from starting. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH produces 1.5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.o Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows :- Method of ATP formationNo of ATPs gained perglucose (new calculation)No of ATPs As per old calculationPathwayStepEnzymeSourceGlycolysis1Hexokinase- Minus1Minus 1Do3Phosphofructokinase- Minus1Minus IDo5Glyceraldehyde-3-p DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5x2 =53x2=6Do61J-BPG kinaseATPSubstrate level1x2 =21x2=2Do9Pyruvate kinaseATPSubstrate level1x2 =21x2=2Pyruvate to Acetyl CoA-PyruvateDehydrogenaseNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53x2=6 TCA cycle3Isocitrate DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53x2=6Do4Alpha keto glutarate DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53x2=6Do5Succinate thiokinaseGTPSubstrate level1x2 =21x2=2Do6Succicinate DHFADH2Respiratory chain1.5 x 2 =32x2=4Do8Mai ate DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53 x 2= 6Net generation in glycolytic pathway 9 minus 2=710 minus 2=8Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction=5=6Generation In citric acid cycle=20=24Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole=32=38",C

All are true Fanconi's anaemia except,Defect in DNA repair,Bone marrow hyperplasia,Congenital anomaly present,Increased chances of cancer,"Ref Robbins 8/e p1090; 9/e p630 Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by congenital anomalies, bone marrow failure, and leukemia susceptibility. FA cells show chromosome instability and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C. Recent studies indicate that there are at least 8 genetically distinct FA groups (A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G). To date, 6 genes (for A, C, D2, E, F, and G) have been cloned. In this review, we describe the structures and functions of FA proteins. Increasing evidence indicates that the multiple FA proteins cooperate in a biochemical pathway and/or a multimer complex. FANCD2, a downstream component of the FA pathway, has recently been shown to be ubiquitinated in response to DNA damage and to translocate to nuclear foci containing BRCA1, a breast cancer susceptibility gene product, suggesting a role for this protein in DNA repair functions. We also describe 2 emerging issues: genotype-phenotype relationships and mosaicism. The FA pathway is likely to play a critical role as a caretaker of genomic integrity in hematopoietic stem cells. Clarifying the molecular basis of this disease may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure syndromes and myeloid malignancies.",B

A pregnant woman who has a lactase deficiency and cannot tolerate milk in her diet is concerned that she will not be able to produce milk of sufficient caloric value to nourish her baby. The best advice to her is which one of the following?,She must consume pure galactose in order to produce the galactose moiety of lactose.,She will not be able to breastfeed her baby because she cannot produce lactose.,The production of lactose by the mammary gland does not require the ingestion of milk or milk products.,She can produce lactose directly by degrading a-lactalbumin.,"The woman will be able to breastfeed her baby because she can produce lactose from amino acids and other carbohydrates. She will not have to eat pure galactose, or even lactose, to do so. Glucose, which can be provided by gluconeogenesis or obtained from the diet, can be converted to UDP-galactose (glucose-glucose-6-phosphate-glucose-1-phosphate-UDP-glucose-UDP-galactose).

Virulence determinant implicated in pathogenesis of scarlet fever is,Hyaluronidase,M protein,Pyrogenic exotoxin,Streptokinase,"Streptococcal Pyrogenic exotoxin ( erythrogenic, Dick, scarlatinal toxin): the toxin was named erythrogenic because it's intradermal injection into susceptible individuals produced an erythematous reaction. This test was used to identify children susceptible to scarlet fever, a type of acute pharyngitis with extensive erythematous rash, caused by Streptococcus pyogenes strains producing this toxin. The primary effect of the toxin is an induction of fever and so it was renamed streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin. 3 types of SPE have been identified: A, B and C. Types A and C are coded for by bacteriophage genes while type B gene is chromosomal. SPE are superantigens, T cell mitogens that induce a massive release of inflammatory cytokines, causing fever, shock and tissue damage.

TRUE regarding human hea,Conduction of impulse from endocardium to inwards,During exercise duration of systole is reduced more than diastole,HR increases with parasympathetic denervation,Vagal stimulation decreases force of contraction,"C i.e. Hea rate increases with parasympathetic denervationThe duration of systole is much more fixed than that of diastole and when the hea rate is increased (eg. in exercise), diastole is shoened to a much greater degree.QSympathetic & parasympathetic innervationVagal (parasympathetic) fibres are mainly distributed to atria & not much to ventricles. This explains the fact that the main effect of vagal stimulation is to decrease hea rate rather than to decrease the strength of hea contraction greatly (which is dependent on ventricle)Sympathetic (noradrenergic) fibres are distributed to both atria & ventricle. So its stimulation has a strong effect on both hea rate (chronotropic) & force of contraction(ionotropic)FeatureSympathetic(adrenergic)stimulationParasympathetic(cholinergic)stimulationHea rate(chronotropic)IncreasedDecreased (main)ConductionIncreasedDecreasedForce ofcontraction(lonotropic)IncreasedDecreased (to alesser extent)Denervation- At rest, there is a moderate amount of tonic discharge in cardiac sympathetic nerves, whereas vagal tone (tonic discharge) is of good amount.- So when vagi are cut (or parasympatholytic drug eg atropine is given) the normal resting hea rate rises (from 70) to 150-180 beats/min due to unopposed sympathetic tone.

Posture is maintained by,Crossed extensor reflex,Stretch reflex,Golgi tendon reflex,None.,"The dynamic stretch reflex is elicited by the potent dynamic signal transmitted from the primary sensory endings of the muscle spindles, caused by rapid stretch or unstretch. Thus when a muscle is stretched or unstretched, a strong signal is transmitted to the spinal cord which causes an instantaneous strong reflex contraction(or decrease in contraction) of the same muscle from which the signal originated. Thus, reflex functions to oppose sudden changes in muscle length, which maintains the posture. REF: TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY GUYTON AND HALL, 12e Page no 771",B

A strong propensity for vacuolar invasion is seen in,Prostatic carcinoma,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Bronchogenic carcinoma,Gastric carcinoma,"Ref Robbins 7/e p925; 9/e p274 Renal and hepatocellular carcinomas hav high tendency invasion of vascular channels MORPHOLOGY HCC may appear grossly as (1) a unifocal, usually massive tumor; (2) a multifocal tumor made of nodules of variable size; or (3) a diffusely infiltrative cancer, permeating widely and sometimes involving the entire liver, blending imperceptibly into the cirrhotic background. Paicularly in the latter two patterns, it may be difficult to radiologically distinguish regenerative cirrhotic nodules from neoplasms of similar size. Discrete tumor masses usually are yellow- white, punctuated sometimes by bile staining and areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. HCC has a strong propensity for vascular invasion. Extensive intrahepatic metastases are characteristic, and occasionally snakelike masses of tumor invade the poal vein (with occlusion of the poal circula- tion) or inferior vena cava, extending even into the right side of the hea. On histologic examination, HCCs range from well- differentiated lesions that reproduce hepatocytes arranged in cords, trabeculae or glandular patterns (Fig. 15-34), to poorly differentiated lesions, often composed of large, multinucleate anaplastic giant cells. In the better-differentiated vari- ants, globules of bile may be found within the cyto- plasm of cells and in pseudocanaliculi between cells. Acidophilic hyaline inclusions within the cytoplasm may be present, resembling Mallory bodies. There is little stroma in most hepatocellular carcinomas, explaining their soft consistency. A distinctive clinicopathologic variant of HCC is the fibrolamellar carcinoma. It occurs in young male and female adults (20 to 40 years of age) with equal incidence and has no association with cirrhosis or other risk factors. It usually consists of a single tumor with fibrous bands coursing through it, superficially resembling focal nodular hyperplasia. The fibrolamellar variant has a better prognosis than that of the other, more common variants.",B

"A 22-year-old female came with the chief complaint of significant weight loss and secondary amenorrhea. She has a high-intensity exercise regimen, is preoccupied with food, and seems to have an irrational fear of gaining weight. Decreased production of which of the following hormones leads to amenorrhea in anorexia nervosa?",Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH),Progesterone,Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),Estradiol,"In Anorexia nervosa, the severe reduction in GnRH pulsatility leads to suppression of FSH and LH secretion, possibly to undetectable levels, and results in anovulation and low serum estradiol levels. Given the severe psychologic and metabolic stress experienced by these individuals, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is activated. The circadian rhythm of adrenal secretion is maintained, but both coisol production and plasma coisol levels are persistently elevated secondary to increased pituitary secretion of adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH). Serum leptin levels in these individuals are significantly lower than normal healthy controls and correlate with the percentage of body fat and body weight. A rise in leptin levels in response to dietary treatment is associated with a subsequent rise in gonadotropin levels.''Inhibition of reproduction function-- Enhanced release of the coicotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and b-endorphin suppresses GnRH release directly and indirectly through the release of glucocoicoids. Elevated glucocoicoids suppress the release of GnRH, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone, and produce gonadotropin resistance at the gonads.

"Bacteria and fungi share some common mechanisms of resistance to drugs used in treatment of bacterial or fungal infection. However, bacteria have a resistance mechanism not described in fungi. This mechanism is",Alteration in the drug target,Efflux of drug,Inactivation of drug,Influx of drug,"(See the below table for further information). Several mechanisms of resistance to antifungal drugs have been identified. These include alterations in the drug target by mutation or overexpression, drug efflux pumps, changes in ergosterol or sterol content, and changes in uptake and metabolism. Alteration of the drug either through modification or degradation to inactive moieties has not been reported. Resistance to tolnaftate and allylamines that inhibit squalene epoxidase is not common but likely mechanisms include efflux pumps, mutation or overexpression of the enzyme and nonspecific stress adaptation. Resistance to flucytosine may occur via alteration of the permease that reduces entry into the fungal cell or at enzymatic steps, cytosine deaminase or uracil phosphoribosyl transferase, involved in metabolism of the drug to the active compounds. Resistance to azole class drugs may develop through expression of drug efflux pumps and alteration or over-expression of the drug target. In some resistant isolates, more than one mechanism may be operative. Resistance to polyenes may reflect a decrease in ergosterol content of the membrane or production of other non-polyene binding sterols.SELECTED ANTIFUNGAL DRUGS, MODE OF ACTION AND MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCEAntifungal AgentRouteMode of ActionMechanism(s) of ResistanceTolnaftate TopicalInhibition of squalene epoxidase.

Bain Bridge reflex causes:,Increases Hea rate,Decreases hea rate,Decreases blood pressure,Decreases distension of large somatic veins,"A Bainbridge Reflex is a positive feedback mechanism in which there is a compensatory increase in hea rate, due to a rise in right atrial pressure. It is commonly referred to as an Atrial Reflex. Bainbridge reflex, or atrial reflex: is an acceleration of the hea rate resulting from increased blood pressure in, or increased distension of, the large systemic veins and the right upper chamber of the hea. Atrial stretch receptors are responsible for this. Afferent signals: are carried through the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain. Efferent signals are transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase hea rate and strength of hea contraction. Prevents damming of blood in the veins atria and pulmonary circulation. The reflex competes with the baroreceptor-mediated decrease in hea rate produced by volume expansion and is diminished or absent when the initial hea rate is high. Bain bridge Reflex can be eliminated by transection of the cardiac autonomic nerve supply and injection of atropine. A 'reverse' Bainbridge reflex has been proposed to explain the decreases in hea rate observed under conditions in which venous return is reduced, such as during spinal and epidural anesthesia, controlled hypotension, and severe hemorrhage.

This abnormality originates during the embryonic period of lung development. It is classified as either extralobar or intralobar. Extralobar sequestration is a mass of pulmonary parenchyma anatomically separate from the normal lung, with a distinct pleural investment. Its blood supply is derived from the systemic circulation. The left side is involved in more than 90% of cases. Intralobar sequestration is an isolated segment of lung within the normal pleural investment that often receives blood from one or more aeries arising from the aoa or its branches. Intralobar sequestration is usually found within the lower lobes (98%), two-thirds are found on the left side.

"A six-month-old male  child was brought to the opd with  the  chief complaint of fever,  inability to feed  and  seizures since the morning. On  examination, the child was found to have altered sensorium and neck rigidity. A lumbar puncture was carried out and CSF sent for examination.  The  cytology  and biochemistry results were suggestive of pyogenic meningitis. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of Gram-negative  coccobacilli. On culture on blood agar , the  microbe shows the following phenomenon:",Satellitism,Motility,Pleomorphism,All of the above,"H.influenzaeÂ isÂ aÂ smallÂ (1.0Â xÂ 0.3Â  Âµm),Â Gram-negative, non-motile, non-sporing bacillus, exhibiting considerable pleomorphism.Â InÂ sputum, itÂ usually occurs asÂ  clustersÂ ofÂ coccobacillaryÂ  forms,Â  whileÂ inÂ CSF from meningitis cases, long, bacillary and filamentous formsÂ  predominate. Cells from young culturesÂ  (18- 24 hours)Â  are usually coccobacillary, while older cultures are distinctly pleomorphic.Â  Strains isolated from acute infections are often capsulated.
The bacillusÂ  hasÂ  fastidiousÂ  growthÂ  requirements.Â  The accessory growthÂ  factors, named X and V,Â  present in blood are essential for growth.Â 
It isÂ  aerobic but grows anaerobically also. The optimum temperature is 3 7Â°C. It does not grow below 20Â°C. Some strains requireÂ  10% CO2,Â  especially forÂ primary isolation from the clinical specimen. It grows on blood agar if a source of the V factor isÂ  also provided.Â

Q-fever is caused by: March 2005,Rochaemelia quintana,Mycoplasma bovis,Coxiella burnetti,Mycoplasma hominis,"Ans. C: Coxiella burnetti Q fever results from infection by C. burnetii (Coxiella burnetii) which is a rickettsia. Q fever is a zoonosis (zoonosis is a disease which is transmitted from animals to man). The major (primary) sources of human infection of Q fever are infected (with Coxiella burnetii) cattle, sheep, and goats. But, cats, rabbits, pigeons, and dogs can also transmit C. burnetii to humans. Coxiella burnetii uses several techniques to escape immune system as well as the harsh environment where it lives. It forms spores to survive in harsh environments and it escapes intracellular killing in macrophages (by immune system) by inhibiting ceain steps and adapts to the acidic environment of intracellular environment.",C

A farmer presenting with fever on and off for the past 4 years was diagnosed to be suffering from chronic brucellosis. All of the following serological tests are indicatedl in the diagnosis of chronic brucellosis except:,Standard agglutination test,Standard agglutination test,Complement fixation test,Coomb's test,"Patient is suffering from chronic brucellosis. Standard agglutination test identifies mainly the IgM antibodies, which is usually positive in acute infection but may be only weakly positive or even negative in chronic cases. Standard agglutination test is therefore useful in diagnosing acute brucellosis, not chronic brucellosis. Brucellosis is a bacterial zoonosis transmitted directly or indirectly to humans from infected animals, predominantly domesticated ruminants and swine. The disease is known as undulant fever because of its remittent character. Although brucellosis commonly presents as an acute febrile illness, its clinical manifestations vary widely, and definitive signs indicative of the disease is not present. Clinical diagnosis must be suppoed by the results of bacteriologic and/or serologic tests.

"Rods and cones differ in all, except",Signal transduction,Light sensitivity,Wavelength,Acuity,"Our visual sensation is mediated by two types of photoreceptors, rods, and cones. Both respond to light electrically. Rods are highly light-sensitive but cones are not. Because of this sensitivity difference, rods mediate night vision and cones mediate daylight vision. While a response to a brief light flash is rather slow in rods, it is brief in cones. These rod and cone differences in their light sensitivity and the response time course arise in the differences in the reactions in the enzyme cascade to evoke light responses in these cells. This cascade (phototransduction cascade) in rods is now rather well understood at the molecular level in a quantitative way. In cones, similar cascade has been known to be present. However, details are not known yet because it was difficult to obtain purified cones in an amount large enough to study these issues biochemically.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 192",A

DNA polymerase (e.g., Taq polymerase) which can sustain high temperature (> 600 C). A large number of free deoxynucleotides (dNTPs)The target DNA fragment.Procedure:There are three major steps in a PCR, which are repeated for 20 or 30 cycles.a. Heat Denaturation- The DNA sample to be amplified is first heated to separate the two strandsb.Annealing- The primers bind to the two separated strands of DNA ( one for each strand ) flanking the target sequence.c.Extension- Each strand is copied by the DNA polymerase, staing at the primer site. The two DNA strands each serve as a template for the synthesis of new DNA from the two primers.The above three steps are repeated again and again . The number of copies doubles in each cycle. Typically 20-30 cycles are run during this process. There is an exponential increase in the amount of target DNA, amplifying it by a million-fold to a billion-fold.By using a heat stable DNA polymerase( Taq polymerase ), the polymerase is not denatured and, therefore does not have to be added at each successive cycle.Advantages:The major advantage of PCR over cloning as a mechanism for amplifying a specific DNA sequence aresensitivity : DNA sequences present in only trace amounts can be amplified to become the predominant sequencespeedless technically difficult than traditional cloning methods using recombinant DNA techniques. Disadvantages:To synthesize primers, we need to know the sequence flanking the DNA segment of interest.Applies only to sho DNA fragments, typically less than 10 kb.",D

Which finding would be present following selective destruction of Seoli cells?,Increased plasma testosterone levels,Increased plasma inhibin levels,Increased plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) levels,Increased plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels,"Seoli cells are stimulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to secrete the hormone inhibin. Inhibin is a polypeptide hormone with a structure that is similar to that of insulin (i.e., an A chain and a B chain connected by two disulfide bonds). Its physiologic function is to selectively suppress pituitaty release of FSH. Therefore, if Seoli cells are destroyed, plasma levels of inhibin would decrease and plasma levels of FSH would increase as a result of loss of feedback inhibition. Luteinizing hormone (LH) is suppressed by testosterone of Leydig cell origin. Selective destruction of Seoli cells with Leydig cells left intact would have no effect on circulating levels of testosterone or LH. Finally, Seoli cells are vital for normal spermatogenesis. The spermatozoa mature within the folds of the Seoli cells, which provide maturational factors that are required for spermatogenesis.",D

Diurnal variation in Eosinophil count is related to:,Coisol,Thyroxine,Growth hormone,Testesterone,"A i.e. CoisolDiurnal variation in eosinophilic count is reciprocally (invrsely) related to circadian levels of coisolQ.- Suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of hypothalamus is the biological clock responsible for diurnal (circadian) rhythm of ACTH, which intum leads to diurnal rhythm of coisol (glucocoicoid) secretion. In humans, ACTH irregular bursts (episodes of high secretion) are most frequent in early morning and least frequent in the evening. Increased ACTH secretion is not d/t stress of getting up in the morning as these bursts occur before waking up. Even if the length of day is experimentally lengthened to >24 hrs ie if the person is isolated and day's activities are spread over more than 24h, the adrenal cycle also lengthens, but the ACTH burst still occurs during period of sleep. The circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion is present in patients Eosinophil with adrenal insufficiency receiving constant dose of glucocoicoids.- Coisol decrease the number of circulating eosinophils by increasing their sequestration in the spleen & lung. So the diurnal variations in blood eosinophilic counts is inversely related to the circadian coisol levelsQ. The eosinophilic concentration in blood is < 450 / mL usually. A reciprocal relationship to plasma coisol, causes the diurnal eosinophilic concentrations to vary -- 2 fold (40%) with eosinophilic count lowest in morning and peaking in evening.",A

True about Hyaline membrane disease:,FRC above the closing volume,FRC below the closing volume,FRC is equal to closing volume,FRC doesn't depend on closing volume,"B i.e. FRC below the closing volume - Closing volume (CV) or critical CV is minimal volume of gas necessary to prevent small airway collapse. In young adults it is 10% of vital capacity (ie = 480 ML) and becomes equal to - 40% of VC (ie = FRC) at the age of 65 years. In RDS (hyaline membrane disease), the FRC decreases below closing volume (FRC < CV) indicating collapse of some alveolar segments during tidal breathing. - Volume of air in lung at the end of (1) force ful inspiration is TLC; (2) forceful expiration is residual volume (RV) and ; (3) normal tidal expiration is FRC. RV is 1200mL and FRC is 2200 mL. Therefore normally closing volume is more close to RV than to FRC. Closing Volume (CV) and Closing Capacity (CC) CV is volume below which the terminal airway connected to alveoli gets closed and hence the gas cannot come in or out of alveoli. In young subjects, the closing volume is about 10% of vital capacity (V C). It increases with age and becomes equal to about 40% of VC (i.e. = FRC) at the age of 65 years. Relatively small amounts early disease in the small airways apparently increases the closing volume. Single Breath N2 Washout Test to measure CV From mid inspiration, the subject takes a deep breath (vital capacity single breath) of pure (100%) 02 and then exhales steadily. The changes in N2 concentration of expired air (at lips) is continuously measured during subsequent full exhalation. 4 phases of N2 conc. can be recognized one after another. Phase I or initial gas exhaled is the gas that filled the pure dead space. It contains no N2 because inhaled gas is 100% 02. Phase II: Mixture of dead space & alveolar gas is exhaled (with increasing N2 conc). The volume of dead space is volume of gas expired from peak inspiration to mid poion of phase II. 3. Phase III: Pure alveolar gas is exhaled (with constant N2 conc). Phase III terminates at (ie transition from phase III to IV) is closing volume (CV). The CV is the lung volume above RV (residual volume) at which the airways in lower dependent pas of lungs begin to close off because of the lesser transmural pressure in these areas. In most normal persons phase III also has a slight positive slope indicating a gradual increase in the propoion of expired gas coming from relatively N2 rich upper poions of lung. Phase IV: At the end of expiration, an abrupt increase in N2 conc. is seen signaling closure of airways at the base of lung. This is caused by preferential emptying of apex, which has relatively high concentration of Nz. The gas in upper lung is richer in N2 than lower dependent poions because the upper lung alveoli are more distended at the sta of inspiration and therefore the N2 in them is less diluted with 100% 02 inspired from mid inspiration (because during a VC breath of 100% 02, apex expands less and therefore previously occupied N2 there is less diluted with 02). Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) or Relaxation Volume It is volume of air remaining in lungs after normal (tidal) exhalation. and is determined by the balance b/w the elastic recoil pressure generated by lung parenchyma to become smaller (inward recoil) and the pressure generated by chest wall to become larger (outward recoil). At FRC, transmural pressure across respiratory system (chest wall + lung) is zero (0). It is positive at greater & negative at smaller volumes. - FRC decreases when the chest wall muscles are weak, (eg paralysis) or the elastic recoil of lung (i.e. tendency of alveoli to collapse) is more eg hyaline membrane diseaseQ (i.e. lung elastic recoil > chest wall muscle force). Disease characterized by low FRC include pulmonary edema, pneumonitis & RDS/HMD. In hyaline membrane disease, FRC usually decreases below closing volumeQ. When closing capacity exceeds FRC (FRC < CC), some alveolar segments are collapsed during a poion of tidal breathing. This decreases V/P ratio and may cause hypoxia and hypercarbia. And when the CC > FRC + TV. (i.e. C C exceeds FRC plus tidal volume), lung segments will be collapsed during inspiration and expiration of tidal breathing. This fuher exaggerate V/P mismatch and lit complete atelectasis. So respiratory therapy is designated to increase the lung volume towards normal FRC. - Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) raise FRC to a level above CV/CC in diseases associated with alveolar collapse; So the terminal airways remain open throughout the respiratory cycle. In presence of airway obstruction, FRC increases b/o premature airway closure, which traps air in the lung.",B

Which of the following is not an intermediate of citric cycle?,Acetyl-CoA,Succinyl-CoA,a-ketoglutarate,Citrate,"The citric acid cycle - also known as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or the Krebs cycle - is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to generate energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins into carbon dioxide and chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate. In addition, the cycle provides precursors of ceain amino acids as well as the reducing agent NADH that is used in numerous other biochemical reactions. Its central impoance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest established components of cellular metabolism and may have originated abiogenically. The name of this metabolic pathway is derived from citric acid (a type of tricarboxylic acid) that is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of reactions to complete the cycle. In addition, the cycle consumes acetate (in the form of acetyl-CoA) and water, reduces NAD+ to NADH, and produces carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct. The NADH generated by the TCA cycle is fed into the oxidative phosphorylation (electron transpo) pathway. The net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable chemical energy in the form of ATP.Ref: DM Vasudevan, 7th edition, page no: 245",A

The primary reason that the female phenotype develops in an XY male is:,The secretion of progesterone,Adrenal insufficiency,The lack of testosterone action,Increased inhibin secretion,"Ans. C. The lack of testosterone actiona. The female phenotype can develop in an XY male if the biological action of testosterone is absent. This absence can be due to a lack of testosterone secretion caused by enzyme deficiencies or a lack of the testosterone (DHT) receptor. In this process, called testicular feminization, a phenotypic female develops in the presence of an XY karyotype.b. There is a lack of pubic and axillary hair, well-developed breasts (as a result of the conversion of testosterone to estrogen), with inguinal or abdominal testes, no uterus (because AMH is secreted), underdeveloped male accessory ducts (lack of testosterone action), and the vagina ends in a blind pouch.c. Progesterone has no effect on phenotype. There is no evidence that adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol and androgens from the adrenals) have any effect on inducing female phenotype in a male.d. Inhibin would reduce FSH secretion and ultimately reduce adult testis size, but in the fetus there is no effect on the development of the female phenotype. AMH will prevent formation of the oviducts, uterus, and upper vagina; it does not increase female characteristics in the male.",C
Pelvic pain is mediated by,Pudendal nerve,Sciatic nerve,Autonomic nerves,None of the above,"The anatomical structures that may give rise to pain in the pelvic region belong to the urinary, reproductive, and gastrointestinal systems and to their associated blood and lymphatic vessels.

The hypogastric plexus is the main autonomic neuronal center of the pelvis, while the somatic innervation is guaranteed by fibers travels in the pudendal nerve. This is the main nerve of the pelvis, involved in a great amount of pelvic pain conditions. It contains also sympathetic and parasympathetic efferents and visceral afferents. The pudendal nerve originates from the sacral plexus (S2-S4), then exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen into the perineal area, through the pudendal (Alcock's) canal, and finally spreads into three main terminal branches: the inferior rectal nerve, the superficial perineal nerve, and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris, which innervates the pelvic structures and the external genitalia.

H+ is secreted by proton pump (H~ K'ATPase) into the gastric lumen in exchange with a K+ ion and the HCG, is transported out of the parietal cells at the basolateral membrane (by HCO3 - Cl- antiport ) into the interstitial fluid and from there into the blood. This HCO3- increases the blood pH. Hence after a meal, there is a rise in blood pH which is called the post-prandial alkaline tide.o The Cl' that enter the parietal cell in exchange for HCO3 are secreted into the lumen. So, inside the gastric lumen secreted H+ and Cl- from hydrochloric acid (HC1).",B

Based on the information given, the most likely diagnosis is",Mycoplasma pneumonia,Pneumococcal pneumonia,Staphylococcal pneumonia,Influenza,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes a respiratory infection known as primary atypical pneumonia or walking pneumonia. Although disease caused by M. pneumoniae can be contracted year-round, thousands of cases occur during the winter months in all age groups. The disease, if untreated, will persist for 2 weeks or longer. Rare but serious side effects include cardiomyopathies and central nervous system complications. Infection with M. pneumoniae may be treated with either erythromycin or tetracycline. The organism lacks a cell wall and so is resistant to the penicillin and the cephalosporin groups of antibiotics. Until recently, diagnostic tests have been of limited value. Up to 50% of cases may not show cold agglutinins, an insensitive and nonspecific acute-phase reactant. However, if cold agglutinins are present, a quick diagnosis can be made if signs and symptoms are characteristic. Complement fixation tests that measure an antibody to a glycolipid antigen of M. pneumoniae are useful but not routinely performed in most laboratories. Also, cross-reactions may occur. Culture of M. pneumoniae, while not technically difficult, may take up to 2 weeks before visible growth is observed. A DNA probe is available. It is an 125I probe for the 16S ribosomal RNA of M. pneumoniae. Evaluations in a number of laboratories indicate that compared with culture it is highly sensitive and specific.

Calcium absorption is affected by-,Calcitriol,PTH,Proteins,All of the above,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., All of the above * With an average intake of 1000 mg of calcium its net intestinal absorption is only 150-250 mg/day. Calcium is absorbed mainly in the duodenum and jejunum (proximal intestine) by an active transport mechanism regulated by 1, 25 (OH)2 D3 (calcitriol). Parathormone indirectly promotes absorption of calcium by increasing the renal synthesis of 1, 25 (OH)2 D3.* Dietary lactose, proteins and an acidic environment promote calcium absorption. On the other hand, phytates, phosphates, oxalates, tetracycline and and alkaline environment impair calcium absorption.* Calcium is transported across the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells via channels known as transient receptor potential vaniloid type 6 (TRPV6) and binds to an intracellular protein known as calbindin. Calbindin sequesters the absorbed calcium so that it does not disturb the epithelial signaling process that involve calcium. The absorbed Ca+2 is thereby delivered to the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells, from where it can be transported into the blood stream by either a Sodium/Calcium exchanger (NCX1) or a calcium-dependent ATPase.",D

Which passive movement causes pain in deep posterior compament syndrome ?,Foot abduction,Dorsi flexion of foot,Plantar flexion of foot,Foot adduction,"Passive stretching of the muscles produce pain in compament syndrome and hence, dorsiflexion of foot (a) causes pain. Posterior compament of leg is concerned with plantar flexion of foot, and is supplied by the tibial nerve and posterior tibial vessels. Compament syndrome is caused by increased pressure in an enclosed space that leads to compromise of circulation and function of tissues in that space. a. There is elevation of interstitial pressure in closed fascial compament that results in microvascular compromise. b. As duration & magnitude of interstitial pressure increase, myoneural function is impaired & necrosis of soft tissues eventually develops. Pain with passive stretching is the most sensitive early sign of compament syndrome. a. Patient will usually hold injured pa in a position of plantar-flexion to maximally relax the fascia/muscles and reduce pain. b.

Dysmetria,Cerebellum,Cerebrum,Basal ganglia,Premotor coex,"Dysmetria refers to a lack of coordination of movement typified by the undershoot or overshoot of intended position with the hand, arm, leg, or eye. It is a type of ataxia. It is sometimes described as an inability to judge distance or scale. The actual cause of dysmetria is thought to be caused by lesions in the cerebellum or by lesions in the proprioceptive nerves that lead to the cerebellum that coordinate visual, spatial and other sensory information with motor control. Damage to the proprioceptive nerves does not allow the cerebellum to accurately judge where the hand, arm, leg, or eye should move. There are two types of cerebellar disorders that produce dysmetria, specifically midline cerebellar syndromes and hemispheric cerebellar syndromes. Midline cerebellar syndromes can cause ocular dysmetria, Hemispheric cerebellar syndromes cause dysmetria in the typical motor sense that many think of when hearing the term dysmetria.

This genetic disease results from deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase and has an incidence in the American population of approximately 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 bihs. The deficiency impairs the ability of the liver to produce free glucose from glycogen and from gluconeogenesis. Since these are the two principal metabolic mechanisms by which the liver supplies glucose to the rest of the body during periods of fasting, it causes severe hypoglycemia and results in increased glycogen storage in liver and kidneys. Both organs function normally in childhood but are susceptible to a variety of problems in adult years. Other metabolic derangements include lactic acidosis and hyperlipidemia. Frequent or continuous feedings of cornstarch or other carbohydrates are the principal treatment. Other therapeutic measures may be needed for associated problems.Ref: DM Vasudevan, 7th edition, page no: 128",D

"While walking or standing, posture is maintain by ?",Basal ganglia,Hypothalamus,Cerebellum,Amygdala,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Cerebellum Cerebellum, through its connection with the red nucleus influences the activity of brainstem reticular formation and thereby gamma motor neuron activity. Through its connections with the vestibular nucleus and vestibulospinal tract, cerebellum influnences the activity of alpha motor neurons. Thus, normal cerebellar function is essential for the maintenance of normal muscle tone and posture. The cerebellum seems to play crucial roles in walking as well as maintaing a standing posture. Cerebellar vermis plays an impoant role in maintenance of standing postuk. Basal ganglia is also involved in maintaining posture by acting as relay center for extrapyramidal pathways.

Resting membrane potential is maximally affected by which ion-,Na+,K+,Ca2+,Cl-,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., K+ 'RMP is mainly due to difference of concentrations ofK+ ions in ECF and ICF'. -- Chaudhari* The cell membrane is selectively permeable. Due to presence of potassium leak channels K+ ions are freely permeable but permeability of Na+ is much less. In the generation of RMP, following sequence of events occur: -i) K+ diffuses out of cell along its concentration gradient (K+ concentration is very high inside the cells and very low in ECF).ii) The diffusion of K+ produces an intracellular negativity (due to non-diffusibleprotein anion in the cells) which is not nullified by the diffusion of Na+ in the opposite direction (membrane is impermeable to Na+) or diffusion of Cl- in same direction (Cl- concentration is already very high in ECF in comparison to ICF).iii) So, intracellular negativity is produced which opposes outward diffusion of K+ and when the equilibrium is reached, the inward force on K+ due to electrical gradient balances outward force on K+ due to concentation gradient.iv) Finally, at equilibrium inner side of cell is negatively charged with respect to outer side, and resting membrane potential is produced.* So, the RMP is principally due to concentration difference (chemical difference) of K+ in ECF and ICF. In neurons, the resting membrane potential is usually about -70 mV, which is close to the equilibrium potential for K+. Here, it is worth noting that RMP is close to the equilibrium potential of K+ but the value of RMP is exactly same as equilibrium potential of Cl~. It is because other ions also diffuse through membrane, though their effect is very little.",B

Most of the ventricular filling occurs in diastole. So at very high hea rates (>180/min) filling may be compromised decreasing cardiac output per minute.- Because of prolonged action potential, cardiac muscles cannot contract in response to a second stimulus until near the end of initial contraction. That's why cardiac muscles cannot be tetanized like skeletal muscles. The highest rate atwhich hea can contract is 400/min (theoretically) but AV node will not conduct >230 impulses/min b/o its long refractory period. Hence ventricular rate > 230/min is onlyseen in paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia.- Exact clinical measurement of isovolumetric ventricular contraction is difficult but simultaneous recordings of ECG, phonocardiogram and carotid pulse can easily measureTotal Electromechanical systole (Q-S2 interval)It is period from onset of ventricular depolarization (activation) or QRS complex to the closure of aoic valves, as determined by the onset on second hea sound (S2)Pre-ejection Period (PEP)It is difference between QS2 and LVET and represents the electrical and mechanical events preceding systolic ejectionLeft Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET)It is the period between the begining of carotid pressure rise to dicrotic notch (incisura)- Normal PEP/ LVET ratio is 0.35; which increases without change in QS2 when left ventricular function is compromized",A

HCV also is a major cause of liver disease. The worldwide carrier rate is esti- mated at 175 million persons (a 3% prevalence rate, ranging widely from 0.1% to 12%, depending on the country). Per- sistent chronic infection exists in 3 to 4 million persons in the United States, where the number of newly acquired HCV infections per year dropped from 180,000 in the mid- 1980s to about 19,000 in 2006. This welcome change resulted from the marked reduction in transfusion-associated hepa- titis C (as a result of screening procedures) and a decline of infections in intravenous drug abusers (related to prac- tices motivated by fear of human immunodeficiency virus infection). However, the death rate from HCV will con- tinue to climb for 20 to 25 years, because of the decades- long lag time between acute infection and liver failure. The major route of transmission is through blood inoculation, with intravenous drug use accounting for at least 60% of cases in the United States. Transmission by blood products is now for- tunately rare, accounting for only 4% of all acute HCV infections. Occupational exposure among health care workers accounts for another 4% of cases. The rates of sexual transmission and veical transmission are low. Infections of unknown origin account for 9% to 27% of cases. HCV infection has a much higher rate than HBV of pro- gression to chronic disease and eventual cirrhosis (Fig. 15-13). In fact, hepatitis C is the condition that most frequently necessitates liver transplantation in the United States. Viral Structure and Genome. HCV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flavi- viridae. It contains highly conserved 5'- and 3'-terminal regions that flank a single open reading frame of nearly 9500 nucleotides that encode structural and nonstructural proteins. HCV is subclassified into six genotypes, based on the genetic sequence. Moreover, because of the poor fidel- ity of RNA replication, an infected person may carry many HCV variants, called quasispecies. The relationships between quasispecies and disease progression are being investi- gated, but it seems that high multiplicity of quasispecies is associated with worse prognosis. In addition, this variabil- ity seriously hampers effos to develop an HCV vaccine.",D

Trauma and injection drug use are common predisposing conditions. Toxins produced into devitalized tissues under anaerobic conditions result in shock, hemolysis, and myonecrosis. Gas gangrene usually begins 1 to 4 days after the injury but may sta within 10 hours. The earliest repoed finding is severe pain at the site of the wound accompanied by a sense of heaviness or pressure. The disease then progresses rapidly with edema, tenderness, and pallor, followed by discoloration and hemorrhagic bullae. The gas is apparent as crepitus in the tissue, but this is a late sign.

Clearance of the following substance is the hallmark experimental method of measuring the GFR:,Urea,Albumin,Creatinine,Inulin,"Inulin is a polysaccharide starch of about 5-kD molecular weight that is not usually found in the body. It is freely filtered by the glomerulus, but it is not reabsorbed or secreted by the nephron. All the inulin that is filtered flows through the nephron and appears in the urine. Thus, the renal clearance of inulin is relatively large. Inulin in the blood is not taken up by other tissues, and the kidneys are the only excretion route. Thus, inulin clearance is indeed the hallmark experimental method of measuring the GFR. Ref: Eaton D.C., Pooler J.P. (2013). Chapter 3. Clearance. In D.C. Eaton, J.P.

"All of the following genes are associated with establishment of left sidedness, EXCEPT ?",Sonic hedgehog (SHH),Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF 8),Nodal,None of the above,"Left-right-sidedness, also established early in development, is orchestrated by a cascade of genes. When the primitive streak appears, fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is secreted by cells in the node and primitive streak and induces expression of Nodal but only on the left side of the embryo. Later, as the neural plate is induced, FGF8 maintains Nodal expression in the lateral plate mesoderm, as well as LEFTY-2, and both of these genes up-regulate PITX2. PITX2 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor responsible for establishing left-sidedness. Also, it is expressed on the left side of the hea, stomach, and gut primordia, and, if expressed ectopically, it results in laterality defects. Simultaneously, LEFTY is expressed on the left side of the floor plate of the neural tube and may act as a barrier to prevent left-sided signals from crossing over. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) may also function in this role as well as serving as a repressor for left-sided gene expression on the right. Ref: Langman's embryology 11th edition Chapter 35.",D

"With increased flow to loop of Henle, decreased in GFR is by ?",Countercurrent exchanger,Glomerulotubular balance,Tubulo-glomerular feedback,Countercurrent multiplier,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Tubulo-glomerular feedback Autoregulation of GFRThe GFR is normally well autoregulated in the range of 70-180 mm Hg of systemic pressure. Feedback mechanisms intrinsic to the kidney normally keep the renal blood flow and GFR relatively constant, despite marked changes in aerial blood pressure. The relative constancy of GFR and renal blood flow is referred to as autoregulation. The primary function of autoregulation in other tissues (other than kidneys) is to maintain the delivery of oxygen and nutrient at a normal level and to remove the waste products of metabolism, despite changes in aerial pressure. In the kidneys, the non-nal blood flow is much higher than that required for these functions. the major function of autoregulation in the kidney is to maintain a relatively constant GFR and to allow precise control of renal excretion of water and solutes.There are two plausible hypotheses for explaining the autoregulation of GFR (i) Tubuloglomerular feedback hypothesis, and (ii) Myogenic hypothesis.Tubulo-glomerular feedbackTo perform the function of autoregulation, the kidneys have a feedback mechanism that links changes in sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa with the control of renal aeriolar resistance. This feedback helps to ensure a relative constant delivery of sodium chloride to the distal tubule and helps prevent spurious fluctuations in renal excretion that would otherwise occur.The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism has two components that act together to control GFR : - i) An afferent aeriolar feedback mechanism (usually this component is referred to as tubuloglomerular feedback, and ii) An efferent aeriolar feedback mechanism. These feedback mechanisms depend on the juxtaglomerular apparatus which consists of : (i) Macula densa, i.e., specialized epithelium of distal tubule where it comes in contact with afferent aeriole, (ii) Juxtaglomerular cells, i.e., modified smooth muscle cells of afferent aeriole, and iii) Lacis cells.Afferent aeriolar feedback mechanism : - Decrease in renal aeriolar pressure causes decrease in GFR and as a result low NaCI is delivered to distal tubules. This is sensed by macula densa and the signal is transmitted to afferent aerioles which causes decreased resistance of afferent aerioles. Decreased afferent aeriolar resistance increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure and therefore GFR. The transmitter involves is adenosine which causes opening of Ca*2 channels.Efferent aeriolar feedback mechanism : - Decreases GFR causes delivery of less NaCl to distal tubule, which is sensed by macula densa cells and the signal is transmitted to juxtaglomerular (JG) cells which secrete renin. As a result renin angiotensin system is activated and there is generation of angiotensin II which causes constriction of efferent aeriole. This results in increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and increased GFR.Opposite occurs when there is increase aerial pressure and increased GFR. Increased NaCl is delivered to the macula densa which causes constriction of afferent aeriole and decrease,: renin by JG cells with decreased efferent aeriole resistance.It would be wise to know about glomerulotubular balance, which may be confused by tubuloglomerular feedback.Glomerulotubular balance : - Tubular reabsorption in proximal tubules is load-dependent, i.e., when the GFR increase, the reabsorption of the filtrate in the proximal tubule increases propoionately. It occurs because tubular reabsorption is flow-limited. Because of glomerulotubular balance, the urinary Na+ output does not increase massively when the GFR increases.Myogenic AutoregulationAfferent aerioles constrict in response to augmented blood pressure. Aeriolar constriction restores GFR to normal levels. Possibly, stretching of aerioles leads to the opening of stretch - sensitive Ca+2 channels on aeriolar smooth muscle cells resulting in a Ca+ influx that causes the cells to contract.",C

Pseudohyponatremia is found in all of the following EXCEPT:,Severe hyperlipemia,Extreme hyperproteinemia,Aldosterone excess,Hypothyroidism,"Hyponatremia is defined as a plasma level less than 135 meq/L. Most often it reflects excess water, rather than less of Na+, in the plasma. Hence, plasma becomes hypo-osmolar in most instances. Hyponatremia with a normal plasma osmolality is the so-called 'pseudohyponatremia'. It occurs when plasma lipids or proteins are greatly elevated (options A & B). The proteins or lipids do not increase plasma osmolality significantly. However, they occupy a significant volume of the plasma; and hence the measured in the entire plasma is low. Hyponatremia with normal body Na+ content is seen in hypothyroidism (option D), coisol deficiency, and SIADH. Hyponatremia with increased total body Na+ is seen in edematous states, such as congestive hea failure, cirrhosis of liver, and nephrotic syndrome. Hyponatremia with increased plasma osmolality is seen in hyperglycemia associated with uncontrolled DM. In such a condition, the high plasma glucose causes water to move by osmosis, from cells into plasma. The excess water in ECF leads to hyponatremia.",C

Major site for absorption of iron in GIT-,Duodenum,Ileum,Jejunum,Colon,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Duodenum * Iron is absorbed from upper small intestine mainly duodenum. In diet iron occurs in two forms, haeme iron and inorganic (non-haeme) iron. Flaem iron is better absorbed than inorganic iron, but the major fraction of diet is inorganic iron. Inorganic iron is mostly in ferric form; needs to be reduced to ferrous form because iron is absorbed in ferrous form.* After absorption ferrous form is once again oxidized to ferric form inside enterocytes. A fraction of absorbed iron is rapidly delivered to plasma transferrin. However, most of the iron is deposited in the enterocytes as ferritin, some to be transferred more slowly to plasma transferrin, and some to be lost when senescent mucosal cells (enterocytes) are sloughed into the intestine.* Iron absorption is regulated according to the demand, e.g., when there is iron deficiency, absorption increases. This regulation is mediated by uiron metabolism regulatory hormone', i.e., hepcidin that inhibit iron absorption. When there is iron deficiency, concentration of hepacidin falls and there is increase iron absorption. Hepacidin also decreases release of iron from storage sites. Factors affecting iron absorptioni)Decreasing absorption* By complexing (forming chelate) with iron: Phytate, phosphate, milk, EDTA, tetracycline.* By opposing reduction of ferric to ferrous form : Antacids, alkalies, pancreatic secretions.2)Increasing absorption* By enhancing reduction of ferric to ferrous form : Ascorbic acid, HCL, gastric secretions, citric acid.",A

"During starvation, the non-protein RQ value is close to",1,0.5,0.25,0.75,"The respiratory quotient (RQ) is the ratio in the steady state of the volume of CO2 produced to the volume of O2 consumed per unit of time. It should be distinguished from the respiratory exchange ratio (R), which is the ratio of CO2 to O2 at any given time whether or not equilibrium has been reached. R is affected by factors other than metabolism. RQ and R can be calculated for reactions outside the body, for individual organs and tissues, and for the whole body. The RQ of carbohydrate is 1.00, and that of fat is about 0.70. This is because H and O are present in carbohydrate in the same propoions as in water, whereas in the various fats, extra O2 is necessary for the formation of H2O.

GvHD is commonly associated with stem cell transplants such as those that occur with bone marrow transplants. GvHD also applies to other forms of transplanted tissues such as solid organ transplants. White blood cells of the donor's immune system which remain within the donated tissue (the graft) recognize the recipient (the host) as foreign (non-self). The white blood cells present within the transplanted tissue then attack the recipient's body's cells, which leads to GvHD. This should not be confused with a transplant rejection, which occurs when the immune system of the transplant recipient rejects the transplanted tissue; GvHD occurs when the donor's immune system's white blood cells reject the recipient. The underlying principle (alloimmunity) is the same, but the details and course may differ. GvHD can also occur after a blood transfusion if the blood products used have not been irradiated or treated with an approved pathogen reduction system. Ref - wikipedia.org",C

Ovarian artery not only supplies the gonad but also sends small vessels through mesosalpinx to supply the fallopian tube, including a prominent fimbrial branch at the lateral end of the tube.# The uterine artery originates from the internal iliac artery. It usually arises independently from this source but can have a common origin with either the internal pudendal or vaginal artery. Accompanying each uterine artery are several large uterine veins that drain the corpus and cervix.# The vagina receives its blood supply from a downward extension of the uterine artery along the lateral sulci of the vagina and from a vaginal branch of the internal iliac artery. These form an anastomotic arcade along the lateral aspect of the vagina at the 3- and 9-o'clock positions. The distal vagina also receives a supply from the pudendal vessels, and the posterior wall has a contribution from the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal vessels.LYMPHATICS OF THE GENITAL TRACT# Lymphatic drainage of the upper two thirds of the vagina and uterus is primarily to the obturator and internal and external iliac nodes, and the distal-most vagina drains with the vulvar lymphatics to the inguinal nodes. In addition, some lymphatic channels from the uterine corpus extend along the round ligament to the superficial inguinal nodes, and some nodes extend posteriorly along the uterosacral ligaments to the lateral sacral nodes.# The lymphatic drainage of the ovary follows the ovarian vessels to the region of the lower abdominal aorta, where they drain into the lumbar chain of nodes (paraaortic nodes).NERVE SUPPLY:# The uterus receives its from the uterovaginal plexus (FrankenhAuser ganglion) that lies in the connective tissue of the cardinal ligament..",D

The sequence of events in the activation of naive T cells :

Immature dendritic cells in the epidermis are called Langerhans cells.
These immature dendritic cells (Langerhans cells) capture the antigen in the epidermis.
After capturing the antigen, these cells secrete cytokines.
These cytokines cause loss of adhesiveness of Langerhans cells.

A 2-hour-old male infant had been diagnosed in utero with polyhydramnios. Now he is vomiting stomach contents and bile. The vomiting continues for 2 days. Radiographic examination reveals a 'double bubble' sign on ultrasound scan. The child cries consistently and is constantly hungry but has lost 300 g in weight. Which of the following conditions will most likely explain the symptoms?,Duodenal stenosis,Duodenal atresia,Hypertrophied pyloric sphincter,Atrophied gastric antrum,"Duodenal atresia is the result of a failed reformation of the lumen of the duodenum and is associated with vomiting within the first few days of birth. Polyhydramnios is seen due to abnormal absorption of amniotic fluid by the intestines. Finally, radiographic or ultrasound examination would review the 'double bubble' sign because of distended, gas-filled stomach. Duodenal stenosis is caused by incomplete recanalization of the duodenum and often results in vomiting of stomach contents plus bile later in life. Hypertrophied pyloric sphincter would cause projectile vomiting. An atrophied gastric antrum is caused by the removal of the membranous lining of the stomach and occurs proximal to the site of the entrance of the common bile duct; therefore, vomit would not contain bile.

Most important form of carbon-dioxide transport in the blood,It is mostly transported as carboxy hemoglobin,As dissolved CO2,As bicarbonates,Due to CO2 molecules attached to hemoglobin,"(As bicarbonates) (670- Ganong 22nd) (642- K.S 4th) (612-13- Ganong 23rd)Carbon dioxide is transported in blood in four wavs1. As dissolved CO2 form - 7%2. As carbonic acid - negligible3. As bicarbonates - 63%4. As carbamino compounds - 30%Transport of carbon dioxide as BicarbonatesAbout 63% of CO2 is transput ted as bicarbonate. From plasma, the CO2 enters the RBCs. In the RBCs, CO2 combines with water to form carbonic acid. The reaction inside RBCs is very rapid. The rapid formation of carbonic acid inside the RBCs is due to the presence of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. This enzyme accelerates the reaction, carbonic anhydrase is present only inside the RBCs and not in plasma. This is why the carbonic acid formation is at least 200 to 300 times more in the RBCs than in plasmaThe carbonic acid is very unstable. Almost all carbonic acid (99.9%) formed in red- blood corpuscles dissociates into bicarbonates and hydrogen ions. The concentration of bicarbonates ions in the cell increases more and more. The increased concentration of bicarbonate inside the RBC causes diffusion of bicarbonates ions through the cell membrane in to the plasma",C

Which of the following metabolic pathway in carbohydrate metabolism is required for synthesis of nucleic acids?,Gluconeogenesis,Glycolysis,HMP shunt,Glycogenesis,"HMP is an alternative route for the oxidation of glucose (beside glycolysis). It is also called as 'pentose phosphate pathway', 'Dickens - Horecker pathway', 'Shunt pathway' or 'phosphogluconate oxidative pathway'. HMP shunt is required for provision of reduced NADPH and fiver-carbon sugars e.g. ribose (Pentose phosphates) for nucleic acid synthesis.Normally, 90% of glucose is oxidized by glycolysis and 10% is oxidized by HMP shunt. However, in liver and RBCs HMP shunt accounts for oxidation of 30% glucose.HMP shunt occurs in the cytosol. It is highly active in liver, adipose tissue, adrenal coex, lens, cornea, lactating (but not the nonlactating) mammary gland, Gonads (testis, ovary) and erythrocytes. Activity of this pathway is minimal in muscle and brain, where almost all of the glucose is degraded by glycolysis.",C

"All of the following genes are associated with establishment of left sidedness, EXCEPT:",Sonic hedgehog,FGF 8,Nodal,None of the above,"Left-right-sidedness, also established early in development, is orchestrated by a cascade of genes. When the primitive streak appears, fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is secreted by cells in the node and primitive streak and induces expression of Nodal but only on the left side of the embryo. Later, as the neural plate is induced, FGF8 maintains Nodal expression in the lateral plate mesoderm, as well as LEFTY-2, and both of these genes upregulate PITX2. PITX2 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor responsible for establishing left-sidedness. Also, it is expressed on the left side of the hea, stomach, and gut primordia, and, if expressed ectopically, it results in laterality defects. Simultaneously, LEFTY is expressed on the left side of the floor plate of the neural tube and may act as a barrier to prevent left-sided signals from crossing over. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) may also function in this role as well as serving as a repressor for left-sided gene expression on the right. Ref: Langman's embryology 11th edition Chapter 35.",D

Atherosclerosis is due to,HDL receptor defect,Apo protein E deficiency,Decreased LDL activity,Decreased lipoprotein lipase,"Atherosclerosis is a slowly progressive disease of large to medium-sized muscular aeries and large elastic aeries characterised by elevated focal intimal fibrofattyPlaques. Principal larger vessels affected are the abdominal aoa, descending thoracic aoa, internal carotid aeries and medium to smaller sized vessels affected are popliteal aeries, coronary aeries, and circle of Willis in brain. The atheroma may be preceded by fatty streaks that are intimal collection of lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells, occurring in persons as young as one year of age.The disease typically manifests in later life as the vessel lumen is compromised, predisposing to thrombosis and the underlying media is thinned, predisposing to aneurysm formation. It is the number one killer disease, 50 per cent of all deaths in the USA are attributed to atherosclerosis and half of theseare due to acute myocardial infarctions. The remainder include cerebrovascular accidents ('stroke'), aneurysm rupture, mesenteric occlusion and gangrene of theextremities. Etiological Factors Major risk factors in CHD have been discussed earlier. Risk of developing atherosclerosis increases with age, a positive family history, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypeension, and hypercholesterolemia. The risk is correlated with elevated LDL and inversely related to the HDL level. Hereditary defects, e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia involving the LDL receptor or the LDL apoproteins cause elevated LDL, hypercholesterolemia andaccelerated atherosclerosis. Lesser influences on the risk of atherosclerosis include sedentary, or high-stress lifestyle, obesity and oral contraceptives.Ref: M.N.

The blood-brain barrier is formed by,Oligodendrocytes,Astrocytes,Microglial cells,Schwann cells,"There are three types of microglia: oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, and astrocytes. Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells are involved in myelin formation around axons in the CNS and peripheral nervous system, respectively. Astrocytes, which are found throughout the brain, are fuher subdivided into two groups. Fibrous astrocytes, which contain many intermediate filaments, are found primarily in white matter. Protoplasmic astrocytes are found in gray matter and have a granular cytoplasm. Both types of astrocytes send processes to blood vessels, where they induce capillaries to form the tight junctions making up the blood-brain barrier.

Melatonin is associated with all of the following except: March 2010,Vomiting,Pituitary gland secretion,Sleep mechanism,Jetlag,"Ans. A: Vomiting Melatonin and the enzymes responsible for its synthesis from serotonin by N-acetylation and 0-methylation are present in pineal parenchymal cells, and the hormone is secreted by them into the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid. Melatonin synthesis and secretion are increased during the dark period of the day and maintained at a low level during the daylight hours. This remarkable diurnal variation in secretion is brought about by norepinephrine secreted by the postganglionic sympathetic nerves (nervi conarii) that innervate the pineal. The norepinephrine acts -adrenergic receptors in the pineal to increase intracellular cAMP, and the cAMP in turn produces a marked increase in N-acetyltransferase activity. This results in increased melatonin synthesis and secretion. Effects of Melatonin: It plays a role in sleep mechanism It is supposed to decrease gonadotropic hormone secretion by anterior pituitary Vomiting centre is located in the brain stem. From here, motor impulses that cause the actual vomiting are transmitted from the vomiting center by the way of the 5th,7th,9th,10th and 12th cranial nerves to the upper GIT, through vagal and sympathetic nerves to the lower tract and through spinal nerves to the diaphragm and abdominal vessels.",A

The influenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviruses. They cause acute respiratory tract infections that usually occur in epidemics. Isolated strains of influenza virus are named after the virus type (influenza A, B, or C) as well as the host and location of initial isolation, the year of isolation, and the antigenic designation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins under separate genetic control, and because of this they can and do vary independently. The changes in these antigens are responsible for the antigenic drift characteristic of these viruses. The paramyxoviruses include several important human pathogens (mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus). Both paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is a structural component of the virion and produces the initial RNA. Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are not related to the paramyxoviruses. They are 150-nm single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 2 antigen groups, A and B, which play no role in diagnosis and treatment. While the overall mortality is 0.5%, at-risk groups may be 25 to 35% mortality if untreated. Some parainfluenza virus infections (type 3) may be indistinguishable from RSV, but most parainfluenza infections produce a laryngotracheobronchitis known as croup.",A

A decrease in which of the following is the most likely cause of peripheral edema in a patient with long-term alcoholism and liver disease?,Capillary hydrostatic pressure,Interstitial colloid osmotic pressure,Interstitial hydrostatic pressure,Plasma colloid osmotic pressure,"- Osmotic pressure of a solution is an indicator of the force of water movement resulting from its solute concentration. The higher the solute concentration of a solution, the greater its osmotic pressure. The plasma colloid osmotic pressure is often low in alcoholics with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The diseased liver cannot produce adequate amounts of albumin, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of albumin in the plasma (i.e., hypoalbuminemia).
- Because approximately 75% of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure can be attributed to the presence of albumin in the plasma, the decrease in plasma albumin concentration that occurs in the latter stages of cirrhosis often leads to peripheral edema. Cirrhosis also causes excess fluid to accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites.
- In the case of ascites, the edema results not only from hypoalbuminemia, but also from portal vein obstruction (which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure) and the obstruction of lymphatic drainage of the liver. In fact, ascites is observed more often than peripheral edema in liver disease.",D

In hemoglobin the innate affinity of heme for carbon monoxide is diminished by the presence of,His F8,His E7,GlyB6,ThrC4,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., His E-7 The heme has high affinity for carbon monoxide (about 25000 more than for oxygen)But when heme molecule is associated with Histidine E7 [( as occurs in myoglobin), its affinity for CO is drastically reduced, because the presence of His E7 creates a hindered environment for CO by disturbing the orientation of atoms in the heme moleculeSee what Harper writes- 'Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to isolated heme about 25000times more strongly than does oxygen. The atmosphere contains traces of CO, and normal catabolism of heme itself forms small quantities of CO. Why then does not CO (rather than 02) occupy the sixth coordination position of the heme iron of myoglobin? The answer lies in the hindered environment of heme in myoglobin. The preferred orientation for CO to heme iron is with all three atoms (Fe, C, and O) perpendicular to heme ring.* While this orientation is possible for isolated heme, in myoglobin the distal histidine (His-E7) sterically hinders binding of CO at this angle. *Angles for bonding of oxygen and carbon monoxide to the heme iron of myoglobin. The distal E7 histidine hinders bonding of CO at the preferred (180-degree) angle to the plane of the heme ring. This forces CO to bind in a less favoured configuration and reduces the strength of the heme - CO bond over two orders of magnitude'",B

Which of the following hormones is mainly responsible for skeletal maturation:,Testosterone,Estrogen,Growth hormone,Testosterone/ estrogen ratio,"B i.e. Estrogen Growth spu at pubey occurs because of androgen & estrogens, but estrogen ultimately terminate growth by causing the epiphyses to fuse to the long bones (epiphysial closure). Once the epiphyses have closed, linear growth ceases. Patient with sexual precocity are apt to be dwarfed. On the other hand men who were castrated before pubey tend to be tall because their estrogen production is decreased & their epiphysis remain open. These observation suggest that estrogen, rather than androgen, are responsible for bone maturation that ultimately leads to epiphyseal fusion and cessation of growthQ.",B

Total parathyroid gland in our body are?,1,2,3,4,"ANSWER: (D) 4REF: Gray's Anatomy 40th ed Ch: 32Parathyroid glands:The parathyroid glands are small, yellowish-brown, ovoid or lentiform structures, usually lying between the posterior lobar borders of the thyroid gland and its capsule.They are commonly 6 mm long, 3-4 mm across, and 1-2 mm from back to front, each weighing about 50 mg.Usually there are two on each side, superior and inferior.Variations:There may be only three or many minute parathyroid islands scattered in connective tissue near the usual sites.Normally the inferior parathyroids migrate only to the inferior thyroid poles, but they may descend with the thymus into the thorax or not descend at all, remaining above their normal level near the carotid bifurcation. To help identification, the anastomotic connection between the superior and inferior thyroid arteries along the posterior border of the thyroid gland usually passes very close to the parathyroids.The inferior pair are more variably situated , and may be within the fascial thyroid sheath, below the inferior thyroid arteries and near the inferior lobar poles; or outside the sheath, immediately above an inferior thyroid artery; or in the thyroid gland near its inferior poleThe superior parathyroids are usually dorsal, the inferior parathyroids ventral, to the recurrent laryngeal nerves.Vasculature: The parathyroid glands have a rich blood supply from the inferior thyroid arteries or from anastomoses between the superior and inferior vessels.Approximately one-third of human parathyroid glands have two or more parathyroid arteries. Lymph vessels are numerous and associated with those of the thyroid and thymus glands.Nerve supply: The nerve supply is sympathetic, either direct from the superior or middle cervical ganglia or via a plexus in the fascia on the posterior lobar aspects. Parathyroid activity is controlled by variations in blood calcium level: it is inhibited by a rise and stimulated by a fall. The nerves are believed to be vasomotor but not secretomotorHistology : Contains two types of cellsActive cells or chief cells which produce parathormone. Chief cells differ ultrastructurally according to their level of activity: active chief cells have large Golgi complexes with numerous vesicles and small membrane-bound granules. Glycogen granules are most abundant in inactive cells, which appear histologically as 'clear' cells. In normal human parathyroid glands, inactive chief cells outnumber active cells in a ratio of 3-5:1Second cell type, the oxyphil (eosinophil) cell, appears just before puber ty and increases in number with age. Oxyphil cells are larger than chief cells and contain more cytoplasm, ivhich stains deeply with eosin. Their nuclei are smaller and more darkly staining than those of chief cells, and their cytoplasm is unusually rich in mitochondria. The functional significance of oxyphil cells and their relationship to chief cells are uncertain",D
Which among the following is true about Super antigens?,They bind to the cleft of the MHC,Needs to processed before presentation,They are presented by APC' S to T cells,Directly attached to lateral aspect of TCR B chain,"A group of antigens have been termed superantigens because they stimulate a much larger number of T cells than would be predicted based on the specificity of combining site diversity. This causes a massive cytokine release. The action of superantigens is based on their ability to bind directly to MHC proteins and to paicular V regions of the TCR without involving the antigen combining site. Individual superantigens recognize exposed poions defined by framework residues that are common to the structure of one or more V regions. Any T cells bearing those V sites may be directly stimulated. Ref: Ray C.G., Ryan K.J. (2010). Chapter 2. Immune Response to Infection. In C.G. Ray, K.J.

A 24-year-old female presented with pain during urination. Gram stain of the uncentrifuged urine revealed the presence of gram-negative rods. What virulence factor is essential for the survival of these uropathogenic bacteria in the urinary tract?,Pili,LPS (endotoxin),Heat labile toxin,Flagella,"Pili (a) or fimbriae are hair like structures that are found on the surface of many bacteria. They are composed of repeated subunits of the pilin protein. They promote bacterial adherence to each other and bacterial adherence to different host tissues. Uropathogenic E. coli colonize the urinary tract and resist the washing action of urine through their pili. The tip of the pilus contains a specific protein that recognizes a receptor on the host cell. The other choices are not involved in E. coli uropathogenesis. Capsules (e) are loose polysaccharide or protein layers that surround the gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria. Capsules are antiphagocytic, protect the bacteria from hydrophobic molecules, and promote adhere of certain bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to host tissues. Flagella (d), which are anchored on the bacterial surface, are essential for bacterial motility. The heat-labile (c) and heat-stabile toxins are enterotoxins secreted by the enterotoxigenic E. coli. These toxins produce watery diarrhea by stimulating hypersecretion of fluids. LPS (b) composes the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in gram-negative bacteria and is an endotoxin, which stimulates innate immune responses.",A
A 35-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with pain on swallowing. Imaging reveals a dilated left atrium. Which structure is most likely being compressed by the expansion of the left atrium to result in the patient's symptoms?,Esophagus,Root of the lung,Trachea,Superior vena cava,"The patient's chief complaint is pain upon swallowing. With a dilated left atrium, the most probable structure being compressed is the esophagus. The esophagus descends into the abdomen immediately posterior to the left atrium below the level of the tracheal carina. The root of the lung is the site of junction at the hilum where the pulmonary arteries, veins, and bronchi enter or leave. The lung root is not so intimately associated with the esophagus and would not be associated with pain during swallowing. The trachea ends and bifurcates above the level of the left atrium and therefore would be unaffected by a dilated left atrium. The inferior vena cava ascends from the abdomen to the right atrium and the superior vena cava is quite anterior in position. Neither of these veins is closely related to the esophagus or the left atrium.",A

The Young-Helmholtz theory postulates that the retina contains three types of cones, each with a different photopigment maximally sensitive to one of the primary colors (red, blue, and green). The sensation of any given color is determined by the relative frequency of impulses from each type of cone. Parvocellular ganglion cells receive color-specific signals from the three types of cones and relay them to the brain the optic nerve. Ref: Waxman S.G. (2010). Chapter 15. The Visual System. In S.G.

A 55-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for an iliofemoral bypass. The operation is performed successfully and the blood flow between the iliac and femoral arteries is restored. During rehabilitation which of the following arteries should be palpated to monitor good circulation of the lower limb?,Anterior tibial,Deep fibular (peroneal),Deep plantar,Dorsalis pedis,"The dorsalis pedis is the continuation of the anterior tibial artery into the foot, as it passes the distal end of the tibia and the ankle joint. The pulse of the dorsalis pedis can be felt between the tendon of the extensor hallucis longus and the tendon of the extensor digitorum longus to the second toe. A strong pulse is a positive indicator of circulation through the limb. The fibular (peroneal) artery is a branch of the posterior tibial artery and passes in the calf between the flexor hallucis longus and tibialis posterior, making it difficult to palpate. The deep plantar artery, the extension of the first dorsal interosseous or lateral plantar arteries, passes deep to the aponeurotic tissues and central muscles of the foot, making palpation unlikely. The dorsal metatarsal branches of the dorsalis pedis pass under cover of the extensor digitorum longus and brevis tendons. Palpable pulses of the first or other dorsal metatarsal arteries can therefore be difficult to detect.",D
"Which of the following hormones are increased due to stress during surgery, especially in DM:",Epinephrine,GH,Glucocoicoids,All,"A i.e. Epinephrine; B i.e. GH; C i.e. Glucocoicoid Glucagon, catecholamines (epinephrine & norepinephrine), coisol, ACTH, GH (growth hormone) are increased in stress (infection, surgery, hypoglycemia) whereas, insulin is suppressed (decreased)Q. In maintenance of internal homeostasis (ie avoiding stress) and reproduction processes, multiple hormones cooperate to bring about organized biochemical & physiological responses. Stress Syndrome: CRH - ACTH - Coisol Axis The primitive signal of glucose (substrate) lack is expanded to a broder signal of fright or stress and evokes a coordinated neural and endocrine response. Any stressful event eg. surgery, infection, burn triggers a hypermetabolic state in which a resting energy expenditure is increased alongwith body temperature. CRH-ACTH - coisol axis is central to this integrated response to stress. Features of Stress Syndrome - Coicotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is increased in response to noxious environmental stimuli like pain, trauma, hypoglycemia, infection, surgery, hypovolemia. Various nervous impulses using several neuro transmitters (NTs) like norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, and GABA reach CRH neurosecretory cells and cause release of CRH - In response to CRH, both ACTH and p endorphins (secreted 13-LPH & mature p-endorphin) are released in equimolar quantities 13-endorphin produce central analgesic response. - Glucagon & catecholamines (epinephrine & norepinephrine) are increased, stimulating glycogenolysis (glucose production in liver) for immediate use by critical organs such as the brain. - Coisol production is increased in adrenal coex which induces gluconeogenesis (glucose production from noncarbohydrate source like muscles & other body proteins) - Glucogon, epinephrine, ACTH and growth hormone (GH) stimulate lipolysis and free fatty acids (FFA) & ketones are released into the circulation to be used as an alternative metabolic fuel. - Insulin is suppressedQ that results in decrease in glucose utilization. - One form of stress that is cold, specially in neonate causes increased TRH secretion due to depressed metabolism of neurons in pre- optic area by cooling which release inhibitory discharge, permitting TRH secretion. - ADH (vasopressin), angiotensin & aldosterone synthesis is increased enhancing salt water retention - So increased glucose production (by glycogenolysis & gluconeogenesis) and decreased utilization of glucose results in hyperglycemia. There is marked increase in release of aminoacids from tissue protein, paicularly from skeletal muscle for gluconeogenesis. However, synthesis of specific proteins may increase - These metabolic changes are coordinated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity causing peripheral vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure.",D

New techniques of confocal microscopy demonstrated that dendritic spines are indeed motile and dynamic structures that undergo a constant turnover, even after birthPost natal growth of CNSThough almost all neurons are present at birth, the brain continues to grow for a few years after birth.Though it was believed that neurons do not grow after birth, the CNS growth was attributed to Glial cells.Glial cells continue to divide and multiply even after birth.Glia carries out many important functions for normal brain function including insulating nerve cells with myelin. The neurons in the brain also make many new connections after birth.But recently, there are evidences to show that even Neuron grow and develop after birth.The component of neuron associated with growth is Dendritic spinesParts of NeuronMost neurons have three main parts:DendritesPerikarya (cell bodies)AxonThe dendrites are receptive to stimuli and bring stimuli from the environment (sensory epithelial cells or other neurons) to the cell body.There are usually several dendrites per neuron.The perikaryon (cell body) is also receptive to stimuli, but also serves as the trophic or synthesizing center for the whole nerve.The axon is a long process emerging from the cell body.There is only a single axon for each neuron.The axon transmits impulses to other neurons, or to effectors: muscle or gland cells.The distal portion of the axon is usually branched (terminal arborization).",C

Regarding clostridium perfringens gas gangrene false is ?,Clostridium perfringens is the most common cause of gas gangrene,Naegler reaction positive,Most impoant toxin is hyaluronidase,Food poisoning strain of clostridium perfringens produces heat resistant spores,"Most common toxin is hyaluronidase Clostridium are gram positive spore forming rods. - The spores enable these organisms to survive in adverse conditions e.g. in soil and dust and on skin. - Most species are obligate anaerobes i.e. their spores do not germinate and growth does not normally proceed unless a suitably low redox potential (Eb) exists. Clostridium perfringens Clostridium perfringens cause two impoant diseases:? Gas gangrene 'Clostridium perfringens is the commonest cause of gas gangrene'. The disease is characterized by rapidly spreading edema, myositis and necrosis of tissues, gas production and profound toxemia. Clostridium perfringens produces several toxins and other substance which have a role in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. 'a Toxin a phospholipase lecithinase' is generally considered to he the most impoant toxin in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. -It is produced by all types of clostridium perfringens and most abundantly by type 'A' strains. - It is the most impoant toxin biologically and is responsible .for profound toxemia of the gas gangrene. - It is a 'phospholipase'. Other factors which also have a role in virulence:- Hyaluronida.ve It breaks down intercellular cement substance and promotes the spread of the infection along the tissue planes Collagenases and other proteinases They break down tissues and viually liquefy muscles. Clostridium food poisoning:- Clostridium perfringens is an impoant cause of food poisoning. The .food poisoning is caused due to ingestion of spores. The spores of the clostridium perfringens strains that cause food poisoning are heat resistant. -The unique feature of spores produced by food poisoning strains of clostridium perfringens is that they are heat resistant that can survive boiling for several hours. Remember - Only those strains of clostridia which are associated with food poisoning produce heat resistant spores Where as - The classic strains of this species do not have heat resistant spores. These spores are inactivated within few minutes by boiling. Typical, food poisoning strains of clostridium perfringens occur as carrier state. These strains also occur in animals thus meat is often contaminated with heat resistant spores. The vehicle of infection is usually a precooked meat food that has been allowed to stand at a temperature. The heat resistance of the spores ensures their survival in cooking. - During the cooling period they germinate in the anaerobic environment produced by the cooked meat and multiply. - Anyone who eats this meat will consume the equivalent of cooked meat broth culture of the organisms. - Large numbers of clostridia are thus consumed which may pass unharmed by the gastric acid due to high protein in the meat and reach the intestines where they produce the enterotoxin. - After an incubation period of 8-24 hours abdominal pain diarrhoea set in. Naegeler reaction ft is used to detect alpha toxin which is a phospholipase (lecithinase C) - Lecithinase or phospholipase in the presence of Ca++ and Mg' ions splits lecithin into phosphorylcholine and diacylglycerol. This reaction is seen as an 'opalescence' in serum or egg yolk media. Procedure CI perfringens is grown on a plate where one half of the plate is covered with alpha antitoxin. The half poion of the plate without the antitoxin produces opalescene. - Pho.spholipase or a toxin splits the lecithin into phosphorylcholine and diacyl glycerol. Which is seen as opalescnee. The other half of the plate where alpha antitoxin is present does not demonstrate opalescence because here alpha toxin or phospholipase is neutralized by the toxin.",C

Which of the following represents the primary function of the pentose phosphate pathway in erythrocytes?,Production of NADPH,Production of Ribose-5-phosphate,"Remodeling of dietary carbon atoms into two, three-bisphosphoglycerate",Synthesis of ATP,"Erythrocytes are the specialized oxygen transpoing cells of the body. As such, they are continuously exposed to an oxidizing environment. These conditions can have profound effects on membrane lipids as a consequence of their attack by peroxides (paicularly hydrogen peroxide) prevalent in this environment. During the reduction of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase, glutathione acts as a donor of the necessary reducing equivalent generating oxidized glutathione. Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide of the structure gamma glutamyl cysteinyl-glycine, where the cysteine sulfhydryl side chains can form a disulfide bond between two molecules (designated as GSSG). To again perform the role of cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, the disulfide bond of GSSG must be reduced. This reaction is catalyzed by glutathione reductase which requires NADPH as a cofactor. Therefore, in order to maintain a red cell membrane structure, erythrocytes utilize the pentose phosphate pathway for the generation of large amounts of NADPH. Erythrocytes are enucleate and therefore do not synthesize DNA and have no need for ribose-5-phosphate. Production of 2, 3- diphosphoglycerate occurs through a side reaction of glycolysis, not the pentose phosphate pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway does not generate ATP or result in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Ref: Bender D.A., Mayes P.A. (2011). Chapter 21.

Respiratory burst is due to which enzyme,NADH oxidase,Catalase,SOD,Glutathione peroxidase,"Phagocytosis: Phagocytosis (Greek word-Phagein-to eat) is the engulfment of large paicles like viruses, bacteria, cells, or debris by macrophages and granulocytes. They extend pseudopodia and surround the paicles to form phagosomes which later fuse with lysosomes to form Phagolysosomes in which the paicles are digested. Biochemical mechanism is called respiratory burst, in which O2 consumption is increased and lead to formation of superoxide ion O2-. Superoxide anion O2- is conveed to H2O2 and other free radicals OH* and OCl-, etc. which are potent microbial agent. O2- + O2- + 2H+ - H2O2 + O2 The electron transpo chain system responsible for the 'respiratory burst' is 'NADPH oxidase'. In resting phagocyte it is in an inactive form, consisting of cytochrome b 558 + two polypeptides (heterodimer). The NADPH oxidase system is activated by recruitment in plasma membrane by two more cytoplasmic polypeptides. Thus: 2 Cytoplasmic polypeptides Cytb558 + 2 Polypeptides _______________________ Cytb588 (Inactive NADPH oxidase) + 4 Polypeptides (Active NADPH oxidase) NADPH oxidase is activated upon contact with various ligands like complement fragment C5a, chemotactic peptides, etc. Events resulting in activation of the NADPH oxidase system involve G proteins, activation of phospholipase C and generation of inositol-1, 4, 5-triphosphate (P3). The P3 mediates a transient increase in the level of cytosolic Ca++, which is essential for the induction of the respiratory burst. Killing of bacteria within phagolysosomes appears to depend on the combined action of elevated pH, superoxide ions or other 'free radicals' like H2O2, OH*, and HOCl (hypochlorous acid) and on the action of ceain bactericidal peptides, called defensins and other proteins, e.g. cathepsin G and ceain cationic proteins present in phagocytic cells. Macrophages are extremely active and may ingest 25 percent of their volume per hour. In such a process, a macrophage may internalize 3 percent of its plasma membrane each minute or the entire membrane every 1/2 hour. CLINICAL ASPECT Chronic granulomatous disease has been recently implicated due to defective phagocytosis and respiratory burst. The disease is characterized by * Recurrent infections * Widespread granuloma formation in various tissues like lungs, lymph nodes, skin, etc. Fig. 2.11: Sequence of events that occur in chronic granulomatous disease Defect: The disorder is attributed to mutations in the genes encoding the four polypeptides that constitute the active NADPH oxidase system.

Ion which promotes glucose absorption in the gut region: September 2007,CI ?,K+,Na+,Ca2+,"Ans. C: Na+Glucose enters cells by facilitated diffusion or, in the intestine and kidneys, by secondary active transpo with Na+. In muscle, fat, and some other tissues, insulin facilitates glucose entry into cells by increasing the number of glucose transpoers in the cell membranes.The glucose transpoers that are responsible for facilitated diffusion of glucose across cell membranes are a family of closely related proteins that cross the cell membrane 12 times and have their amino and carboxyl terminals inside the cell. They differ from and have no homology with the sodium-dependent glucose transpoers, SGLT 1 and SGLT 2, responsible for the secondary active transpo of glucose out of the intestine, although the SGLTs also have 12 transmembrane domains. Paicularly in transmembrane helical segments 3, 5, 7, and 11, the amino acids of the facilitative transpoers appear to surround channels that glucose can enter. Presumably, conformation then changes and glucose is released inside the cell.",C

'Umami' is type of,Color blindness,Smell sensation,Taste sensation,Deafness,"Ans. c (Taste sensation) (Ref. Ganong Physiology 23rd/pg. Chapter 10, Figure 10-6.)Umami is the fifth taste sense triggered by glutamate and particularly by the monosodium glutamate (MSG) used so extensively in Asian cooking. The taste is pleasant and sweet but differs from the standard sweet taste. The action of umami receptors explains why foods treated with MSG often taste fuller.UMAMI# Humans have five established basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salt, and umami.# Umami is one of the five basic tastes sensed by specialized receptor cells present on the human tongue.# Umami is a Japanese word meaning 'savory' or 'meaty' and thus applies to the sensation of savoriness--specifically, to the detection of glutamates, which are especially common in meats, cheese and other protein-heavy foods.# Afferent nerves to the nucleus tractus solitarius contain fibers from all types of taste buds, without any clear localization of types.TASTE RECEPTORS# The sour taste is triggered by protons.# Umami taste is due to activation of a truncated metabotopic glutamate receptor, mGluR4, in the taste buds, and the agonists are purine 5-ribonucleotides such as IMP and GMP in the food.# Bitter taste is produced by a variety of unrelated compounds, many of which are poisons. It was originally thought that a single bitter receptor was linked to the heterotrimeric G protein gustducin.# A taste modifier protein, miraculin, has been discovered in a plant. When applied to the tongue, this protein makes acids taste sweet.# A protein that binds taste-producing molecules has been cloned. It is produced by Ebner's glands--glands that secrete mucus into the cleft around vallate papillae and probably have a concentrating and transport function similar to that of the OBP in olfaction.# In humans, the taste buds are located in the mucosa of the epiglottis, palate, and pharynx and in the walls of the fungiform and vallate papillae of the tongue.# The fungiform papillae are rounded structures most numerous near the tip of the tongue; the vallate papillae are prominent structures arranged in a V on the back of the tongue. Each fungiform papilla has up to five taste buds, and they are usually located at the top of the papilla.# The larger vallate papillae each contain up to 100 taste buds, usually located along the sides of the papillae. The small conical filiform papillae that cover the dorsum of the tongue do not usually contain taste buds.# There are a total of about 10,000 taste buds.",C

The most common cause of preventable hospital death is,Acute pulmonary embolism,Hea failure,Myocardial infraction,Cancer,"PE is the most common preventable cause of death among hospitalized patients. Clinical features The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) may be aided by asking three questions: * Is the clinical presentation consistent with PE? * Does the patient have risk factors for PE? * Are there any alternative diagnoses that can explain the patient's presentation? Clinical presentation varies, depending on number, size and distribution of emboli and on underlying cardiorespiratory reserve (Box 17.83). A recognised risk factor is present in 80-90% (see Box 23.65, p. 975). The presence of one or more risk factors increases the risk fuher still. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 619",A

Burkitt's lymphoma is characterized by elevated 'early antigen' tests with a restricted pattern of fluorescence. This disease is caused by,Cytomegalovirus,B. burgdorferi,Epstein-Barr virus,Lymphogranuloma venereum,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus that causes a number of syndromes; the most common is infectious mononucleosis. It is a ubiquitous enveloped DNA virus. Only one serotype of EBV has been recognized, although molecular methods have reorganized a number of genotypes of EBV.Infectious mononucleosis is an acute disease most commonly seen in younger people. It is characterized by a proliferation of lymphocytes, lymph node enlargement, pharyngitis, fatigue, and fever. Infection in young children is usually either asymptomatic or characteristic of an acute upper respiratory infection. Diagnosis is usually made by a positive heterophil test. Heterophil antibodies are those that occur in one species (human) and react with antigens of a different species. The heterophil test may be insensitive (30 to 60%) in children. Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of antibodies to EBV components.EBV causes a variety of other syndromes including Burkitt's lymphoma, the most common childhood cancer in Africa, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, commonly seen in China.Similar mononucleosis-like diseases are caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite. CMV causes fewer than 10% of infectious mononucleosis-like diseases. CMV 'mono' is primarily characterized by fatigue. Congenital infection with CMV almost always causes serious sequelae, such as retardation and hearing loss. T. gondii also causes a variety of clinical problems, among them encephalitis in AIDS patients and food poisoning from the ingestion of raw meat. Although CMV and T. gondii are relatively rare causes of infectious mononucleosis, they must be ruled out, particularly when EBV tests are nonreactive.",C

"A 3-month-old infant was cranky and irritable, became quite lethargic between feedings, and began to develop a potbelly.

This child most likely has a mutation in which one of the following enzymes?",Liver glycogen phosphorylase,Glycogen synthase,Glucose-6-phosphatase,Muscle glycogen phosphorylase,"The child has the symptoms of von Gierke disease, which is caused by a lack of glucose-6-phosphatase activity. In this disorder, neither liver glycogen nor gluconeogenic precursors (e.g., alanine and glycerol) can be used to maintain normal blood glucose levels. The last step (conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose) is deficient for both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Muscle glycogen cannot be used to maintain blood glucose levels because muscle does not contain glucose-6-phosphatase. A defective liver glycogen phosphorylase (Her disease) will not affect the ability of the liver to raise blood glucose levels by gluconeogenesis. In addition, the lack of liver glycogen phosphorylase does not lead to lactic and uric acid accumulation, although mild fasting hypoglycemia can be observed. Defects in liver glycogen synthase (type 0 glycogen storage disease) will lead to hypoglycemia and hyperketonemia, but not lactate acid or uric acid accumulation. Muscle does not contribute to blood glucose levels, so a defect in muscle glycogen phosphorylase (McArdle disease) will not lead to the observed symptoms but will lead to exercise intolerance. A defect in pyruvate kinase will lead to hemolytic anemia, but not the other symptoms observed in the patient.",C

Microorganism motile at 25 degree Celsius but non-motile at 37 degree Celsius and shows actin binding polymerization to escape is:,Listeria monocytogenes,Campylobacter,Yersinia pestis,Streptococcus agalactiae,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Listeria monocytogenes L. monocytogenes is a short, gram positive, non-spore forming rod. The motility test rapidly differentiates listeria from diphtheroids that are members of the normal microbiota of the skin. The organism has several adhesion proteins (Ami, Fbp A, and flagellin proteins) that facilitate bacterial binding to the host cells and that contribute to virulence.It has cell wall surface proteins called internalins A and B that interact with E-cadherin, a receptor on epithelial cells, promoting phagocytosis into the epithelial cells. After phagocytosis, the bacterium is enclosed in a phagolysosome, where the low pH activates the bacterium to produce listeriolysin.This enzyme, along with two phospholipases, lyses the membrane of the phagolysosome and allows the listeriae to escape into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell. The organism proliferates, and ActA, another listerial surface protein, induces host cell actin polymerization, which propels them to the cell membrane. Pushing against the host cell membrane, they cause formation of elongated protrusions called filopods. These filopods are ingested by adjacent epithelial cells, macrophages, and hepatocytes, the listeriae are released, and the cycle begins again. L monocytogenes move from cell to cell without being exposed to antibodies, complement, or polymorphonuclear cells.",A

Erythrocyte glutathione reductase deficiency is seen in deficiency of:,Riboflavin,Folic acid,VitaminC,Vitamin E,"Ans: A (Riboflavin) Ref: Glatzle D, Korner HF Christeiier S. Wiss O. Method for the detection of a biochemical riboflavin deficiency. Stimulation of NADBH2-dependent glutathione reductase from human erythrocytes by FAD in vitro. Investigations on the vitamin B2 status in healthy people and geriatric patients. Int. J Vitam Res 1970:40:166-183Explanation:Glutathione, in reduced form (GSH), maintains cell membrane integrity against oxidative stress by acting as a substrate for the reduction of peroxides to less damaging alcohols by glutathione peroxidase.Glutathione reductase facilitates this process by catalysing the conversion of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to GSH, thereby maintaining an adequate level of intracellular GSH.Optimal glutathione reductase activity depends on adequate availability of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a coenzyme derived from riboflavin (vitamin B-2).Thus glutathione reductase activity is suboptimal in individuals with riboflavin deficiency.Riboflavin (vitamin B-2) is a water soluble B vitamin that serves as a precursor of FAD and flav in mononucleotide.These two compounds are important coenzymes in a variety of electron transfer reactions during energy producing, biosynthetic, detoxifying and electron scavenging processes.",A

The mechanism involved in the absorption of glucose from the small intestine is,Passive diffusion,Facilitated diffusion,Secondary active cotranspo with sodium,Actively by insulin dependent uptake,"Hexoses are rapidly absorbed across the wall of the small intestine. Essentially all the hexoses are removed before the remains of a meal reach the terminal pa of the ileum. The sugar molecules pass from the mucosal cells to the blood in the capillaries draining into the poal vein. The transpo of most hexoses is dependent on Na+ in the intestinal lumen; a high concentration of Na+ in the mucosal surface of the cells facilitates and a low concentration inhibits sugar influx into the epithelial cells. This is because glucose and Na+share the same cotranspoer,or sympo,the sodium-dependent glucose transpoer (SGLT, Na+glucose cotranspoer) The members of this family of transpoers, SGLT 1 and SGLT 2, resemble the glucose transpoers responsible for facilitated diffusion.in that they cross the cell membrane 12 times and have their -COOH and -NH2 terminals on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. However, there is no homology to the glucose transpoer (GLUT) series of transpoers. SGLT-1 is responsible for uptake of dietary glucose from the gut. The related transpoer, SGLT 2, is responsible for glucose transpo out of the renal tubules. Because the intracellular Na+concentration is low in intestinal cells as it is in other cells, Na+moves into the cell along its concentration gradient. Glucose moves with the Na+ and is released in the cell. The Na+is transpoed into the lateral intercellular spaces, and the glucose is transpoed by GLUT 2 into the interstitium and thence to the capillaries. Thus, glucose transpo is an example of secondary active transpo, the energy for glucose transpo is provided indirectly, by the active transpo of Na+ out of the cell. This maintains the concentration gradient across the luminal border of the cell so that more Na+and consequently more glucose enter. When the Na+glucose cotranspoer is congenitally defective, the resulting glucose/galactose malabsorption causes severe diarrhea that is often fatal if glucose and galactose are not promptly removed from the diet.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:453",C

Fascin, a 55-kd actin-bundling protein, represents a highly selective marker for dendritic cells of lymphoid tissues and peripheral blood and is involved in the formation of dendritic processes in maturing epidermal Langerhans cells. Since lesional cells of LCH may represent Langerhans cells arrested at an early stage of activation, immunohistochemical expression offascin in epidermal Langerhans cells and in the lesional cells of 34 cases of LCH was evaluated in paraffin sections using an immunoalkaline phosphatase technique. Though epidermal Langerhans cells were nonreactive for fascin, lesional cells in all LCH cases exhibited immunoreactivityforfascin, CD1a, and S-100 protein. Variation in staining intensity was observed in some cases, possibly reflecting differences in cell maturation or activation. Involved tissues included bone, soft tissue, lymph node, thyroid, orbit, and extradural cranial tissue.

Each GPCR binds to and is activated by a specific ligand stimulus that ranges in size from small molecule catecholamines, lipids, or neurotransmitters to large protein hormones. When a GPCR is activated by its extracellular ligand, a conformational change is induced in the receptor that is transmitted to an attached intracellular heterotrimeric G protein complex. The Gs alpha subunit of the stimulated G protein complex exchanges GDP for GTP and is released from the complex. In a cAMP-dependent pathway, the activated Gs alpha subunit binds to and activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, which, in turn, catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increases in the concentration of the second messenger cAMP may lead to the activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels",A

The distal nephron has a negative luminal potential because it is poorly permeable to negatively charged ions. Therefore, when Na+ is reabsorbed, negatively charged ions, primarily Cl-, lag behind, producing a negative intraluminal potential. Although a similar situation occurs in the proximal tubule, the proximal tubule has a higher permeability to Cl- and, therefore, does not develop as large a negative intraluminal potential. The distal nephron is less permeable to hydrogen than the proximal tubule. Aldosterone increases Na+ reabsorption from the distal nephron but has no effect on the proximal tubule. K+ is reabsorbed from the proximal tubule and secreted by the distal nephron. Although the amount of H+ excreted each day is determined by the amount of H+ secreted into the distal nephron, Proximal tubule secretes much more H+ than the distal nephron.

Squamous cell carcinoma spreads by,Hematogenous route,Lymphatic route,Direct invasion,All,"Ref Robbins 9/e p273 Squamous Cell Carcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma is a common tumor arising on sun- exposed sites in older people. These tumors have a higher incidence in men than in women. In addition to sunlight, predisposing factors include industrial carcinogens (tars and oils), chronic ulcers, old burn scars, ingestion of arseni- cals, and ionizing radiation. As with squamous cell carci- nomas at other sites, those in the skin may be preceded by in situ lesions. PATHOGENESIS The most common exogenous cause of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is UV light exposure, which causes DNA damage (Chapter 5). TP53 mutations caused by UV light- induced DNA damage are common, as are activating mutations in HRAS and loss-of-function mutations in Notch receptors, which transmit signals that regulate the orderly differentiation of normal squamous epithelia. In addition to inducing mutations, UV light (UVB in paicular) may have a transient immunosuppressive effect on skin by impairing antigen presentation by Langerhans cells. This effect may contribute to tumorigenesis by weakening immunosurveil- lance. Patients who are immunosuppressed as a result of chemotherapy or organ transplantation, or who have xeroderma pigmentosum, are at increased risk. Tumors in immunosuppressed persons, paicularly organ transplant recipients, are likely to be associated with HPV infection. TP53 mutations caused by UV light-induced DNA damage are common, as are activating mutations in HRAS. As with squamous cell carcinomas at other sites, those in the skin may be preceded by in situ lesions. MORPHOLOGY Squamous cell carcinomas in situ appear as sharply defined, red, scaling plaques; many arise from prior actinic keratoses. More advanced, invasive lesions are nodular, show variable scale, and may ulcerate (Fig. 23-16, A). Microscopically, squa- mous cell carcinoma in situ is characterized by highly atypical cells at all levels of the epidermis, with nuclear crowding and disorganization. Invasive tumors, defined by penetration of the basement membrane (Fig. 23-16, B), show variable degrees of differentiation, ranging from tumors with cells arranged in orderly lobules that exhibit extensive keratiniza- tion to neoplasms consisting of highly anaplastic cells with foci of necrosis and only aboive, single-cell keratinization (dyskeratosis). Clinical Features Invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the skin often are discovered while small and resectable. Less than 5% have metastasized to regional nodes at diagnosis. The likelihood of metastasis is related to the thickness of the lesion and degree of invasion into the subcutis. Tumors arising in the context of actinic keratoses may be locally aggressive generally metastasize only after long periods of time, while those arising in burn scars, ulcers, and non-sun-exposed skin behave less predictably. Mucosal squamous cell carci- nomas (oral, pulmonary, esophageal, etc.) generally are much more aggressive.",B

Corynebacterium spp. (diphtheroids), just like S. epidermidis, colonize the skin. When these organisms are isolated from cultures of shunts, it is often difficult to be sure if they are the cause of disease or simply contaminants.

"If cellular proteins do not fold into a specific conformation, their function is affected. Ceain disorders arise if specific proteins are misfolded.

Cerebral coex becomes sponge-like in CJD. Thalamus is affected in FFI. In Kuru, cerebellum is affected. It is seen in Fore aborigines in Papua New Guinea. The term 'Kuru' means 'laughing death' in the tribal language. Baruch Blumberg showed that the disease was transmitted by ritual cannibalism (eating of brain of dead person); Carleton Gajdusek isolated the 'unconventional virus' from the affected individuals; both of them were awarded Nobel Prize in 1976 PRIONS The central dogma in molecular biology postulated by Watson and Crick in 1953 was that genetic information passes from DNA to RNA and then to protein. In general, this rule still holds good. In 1970, Temin and Baltimore showed that DNA could be synthesized from RNA by reverse transcriptase. This has paly shattered the central dogma. But could proteins act as an information molecule? Could proteins replicate themselves? This question was considered to be heretical till a few years ago, but no longer so. There are a few diseases characterized by very long incubation period of many years. These 'slow disease agents' were originally thought to be 'unconventional viruses', but now they are proved as prion proteins. Prion Proteins : Abnormal Teiary Structure 'Prions' is the acronym for 'proteinaceous infective paicles'. Stanley Prusiner has described prion proteins (PrP) in 1982, who was awarded Nobel Prize in 1997. PrP is a normal protein of 253 amino acids, found in leukocytes and nerve cells. The matured prion protein (PrP) has 210 amino acids. It exists as asialoglycoprotein, anchored on the cell surface. PrP molecules can undergo a change in structural conformation. The altered molecule is resistant to heat and proteolytic enzymes. The abnormal protein is called PrPsc; 'sc' stands for scrapie, the disease in which it was first isolated. Thus, prions are proteins with correct primary structure, but with abnormal teiary structure. The PrP is in alpha-helical form, but PrPSc is in beta-pleated sheets (Fig. 52.9). Protein folding occurs in a stepwise process. As the polypeptide is being synthesized by the ribosome, the initial segment of protein stas to fold. That in turn ors only ceain folding in the next pa of the protein. By this time, hydrophobic regions aggregate into interior of the protein molecule. Chaperons (Chapter 41) also help in the formation of correct folding of proteins. This process is orderly. Minor alterations in the process may alter the teiary structure. Abnormal Proteins can be infectious A normal gene makes the normal PrP protein. Disease is produced when the gene is mutated or if an abnormal PrPsc is injected or ingested. The 'Seeding Model' explains that the infectious prion induces the nearby normal protein molecules to unfold to abnormal form. It is similar to the conversion of the good 'Dr.Jekyll' to the criminal 'Mr. Hyde' (same person with two personalities, described in the famous novel). These abnormal proteins now conve fuher normal proteins into abnormal varieties, producing a 'chain reaction' that generates new infectious materials. Pathogenesis of Prion Diseases The lysosomal enzymes could break down the normal PrP; but PrPsc cannot be digested. Hence, the prions are accumulated inside the cells, and eventually the cell dies. One pa of prion protein can cause apoptosis (programmed cell death), which also leads to loss of cells. As a group, they are also called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSF), because the brain becomes riddled with small holes like a sponge. Neurons degenerate, protein deposits may accumulate as plaques and glial cells grow larger. Clinically, rapidly progressive dementia sets in with neurological defects and ataxia. All the prion diseases are slowly progressive, but eventually become fatal.Ref: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 6th edition, page no: 588 & 589",A

In which condition hemolysis occurs on oxidation?,G6PD deficiency,Hereditary spherocytosis,Sickle cell anemia,Hemophilia,"ANSWER: (A) G6PD deficiencyREF: Harrison's 17 editions, chapter 101G6PD DeficiencyGlucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a housekeeping enzyme critical in the redox metabolism of all aerobic cells. In red cells, its role is even more critical because it is the only source of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which, directly and via reduced glutathione (GSH), defends these cells against oxidative stress. G6PD deficiency is a prime example of a hemolytic anemia due to interaction between an intra-corpuscular and an extra-corpuscular cause, because in the majority of cases hemolysis is triggered by an exogenous agent. Although in G6PD-deficient subjects there is a decrease in G6PD activity in most tissues, this is less marked than in red cells, and it does not seem to produce symptoms.",A

The most common non-cardiac peripheral factor that leads to decreased cardiac output is:,Decreased blood volume,Acute venous dilation,Obstruction of the large veins,"Decreased tissue mass, especially decreased skeletal muscle mass","Decrease in Cardiac Output Caused by Non-cardiac Peripheral FactorsâDecreased Venous Return. Anything that interferes with venous return also can lead to decreased cardiac output. Some of these factors are the following:
1. Decreased blood volume. By far, the most common non-cardiac peripheral factor that leads to decreased cardiac output is decreased blood volume, resulting most often from hemorrhage. It is clear why this condition decreases the cardiac output: Loss of blood decreases the filling of the vascular system to such a low level that there is not enough blood in the peripheral vessels to create peripheral vascular pressures high enough to push the blood back to the heart.
2. Acute venous dilation. On some occasions, the peripheral veins become acutely vasodilated. This results most often when the sympathetic nervous system suddenly becomes inactive. For instance, fainting often results from sudden loss of sympathetic nervous system activity, which causes the peripheral capacitative vessels, especially the veins, to dilate markedly. This decreases the filling pressure of the vascular system because the blood volume can no longer create adequate pressure in the now flaccid peripheral blood vessels. As a result, the blood âpoolsâ in the vessels and does not return to the heart.
3. Obstruction of the large veins. On rare occasions, the large veins leading into the heart become obstructed, so the blood in the peripheral vessels cannot flow back into the heart. Consequently, the cardiac output falls markedly.
4. Decreased tissue mass, especially decreased skeletal muscle mass. With normal aging or with prolonged periods of physical inactivity, there is usually a reduction in the size of the skeletal muscles. This, in turn, decreases the total oxygen consumption and blood flow needs of the muscles, resulting in decreaseÂ in skeletal muscle blood flow and cardiac output.
5. Decreased metabolic rate of the tissues. If tissue metabolic rate is reduced, such as occurs in skeletal muscle during prolonged bed rest, the oxygen consumption and nutrition needs of the tissues will also be lower. This decreases blood flow to the tissues, resulting in reduced cardiac output. Other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, may also reduce metabolic rate and therefore tissue blood flow and cardiac output.",A

Epidemiologic studies of patients with EM implicated ceain Ixodes ticks as vectors of the disease. Ticks of the I. ricinus complex have larval, nymphal, and adult stages. They require a blood meal at each stage. The risk of infection in a given area depends largely on the density of these ticks as well as their feeding habits and animal hosts, which have evolved differently in different locations. Note - Spirochetes are transmitted in tick-mouse-deer cycle. Ticks must feed on humans in the woods, which is their habitat. Adult and nymph stages can infect humans. Ticks feed on mice and then deer. No deer, no disease. Erythema migrans and febrile aches mark acute disease. A macule or papule appears at the site of the bite and expands to become an annular lesion with a raised, red border and central clearing forming a bull's-eye pattern. As the bull's-eye ring expands, the lesion is known as erythema migrans. Ref: Steere A.C. (2012). Chapter 173. Lyme Borreliosis. In D.L. Longo, A.S. Fauci, D.L. Kasper, S.L. Hauser, J.L. Jameson, J.

Process of coating of pathogen for efficient phagocytosis is known as: September 2011,Agglutination,Transduction,Conjugation,Opsonization,"Ans. D: Opsonization Phagocytosis is largely responsible for depletion of cells coated with antibodies Cells opsonized by the IgG antibodies are recognized by phagocyte Fc receptors, which are specific for the Fc poions of some IgG subclasses Agglutination When a paiculate antigen is mixed with its antibody in the presence of electrolytes at a suitable temperature and pH, the paicles are clumped or agglutinated Transduction Transfer of a poion of the DNA from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage Conjugation It is .a process by whereby a 'male' or 'donor' bacterium 'mates' or makes a physical contact with a 'female' or 'recipient' bacterium and transfers genetic element into it Opsonization It is the process by which a pathogen is marked for ingestion and destruction by a phagocyte. Opsonization involves the binding of an opsonin, e.g., antibody, to a receptor on the pathogen's cell membrane. After opsonin binds to the membrane, phagocytes are attracted to the pathogen. The Fab poion of the antibody binds to the antigen, whereas the Fc poion of the antibody binds to an Fc receptor on the phagocyte, facilitating phagocytosis. The receptor-opsin complex can also create byproducts like C3b and C4b which are impoant components of the complement system. These components are deposited on the cell surface of the pathogen and aid in its destruction. The cell can also be destroyed by a process called antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, in which the pathogen does not need to be phagocytosed to be destroyed. During this process, the pathogen is opsonized and bound with the antibody IgG its Fab domain. Then the antibody binds an immune effector cell its Fc domain and this binding triggers a release of lysis products from the bound immune effector cell (monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and natural killer cells). This process can cause inflammation of surrounding tissues and damage to healthy cells. Opsonin It is any molecule that targets an antigen for an immune response. However, the term is usually used in reference to molecules that act as a binding enhancer for the process of phagocytosis, especially antibodies, which coat the negatively-charged molecules on the membrane. Molecules that activate the complement system are also considered opsonins. Phagocytic cells do not have an FC receptor for IgM, making IgM ineffective in assisting phagocytosis. However, IgM is extremely efficient at activating complement and is, therefore, considered an opsonin. Opsonins can also refer to molecules that target a cell for destruction through the action of Natural Killer cells. Examples of opsonin molecules include: Antibodies: IgG Components of the complement system: C3b, C4b, and iC3b Mannose-binding lectin (initiates the formation of C3b) The most impoant are IgG and C3b.",D
Iron overload,Cannot occur because very efficient excretory mechanism are available,Occur in a deficiency of ferroxidase I,Would be accompanied by an increase in total serum transferrin,Might be caused by an ingestion of large amounts of iron along with alcohol,"Normal plasma contains very little ferritin. Ferritin in plasma is elevated in iron overload. Thus ferritin level in blood is an index of body iron stores. iv. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant protein that is elevated in inflammatory diseases. Estimation of ferritin is also indicated in chronic kidney disease to assess the extent of anemia. v. Synthesis of TfR and ferritin and that of ferritin are reciprocally controlled. Both are controlled by the iron content. When iron levels are high, ferritin is synthesized to store the iron; but the TfR synthesis is blocked. When iron levels are high, iron binds to iron-response-element- binding-protein (IREBP), preventing it from binding to IRE. This will result in synthesis of new ferritin, and suppression of synthesis of TfR. Transferrin receptors (TfR) are present on most of the body cells, especially on cells which synthesize heme. The iron-transferrin complex is taken up by the body cells by the receptor mechanism. The transferrin receptor has a molecular weight of 200 kD. It binds two molecules of transferrin. The iron-transferrin- receptor is internalized. Iron is taken in by the cells, and receptor molecules are externalized. vii. Transferrin is a glycoprotein. Abnormal glycosylation is seen in congenital disorders and in chronic alcohol abuse.Ref: DM Vasudevan, page no: 425",D

Which of the following is an amine hormone?,TSH,T4,Insulin,FSH,"Three general classes of hormone exist : ?1) Proteins and polypentideMost of hormones in the body are polypeptides and proteins. In general, polypeptides with 100 or more aminoacids are called proteins, and those with fewer than 100 amino acids are referred to as peptides.Proteins and peptide hormones are synthesized on the rough ER. They are usually synthesized first as larger proteins (precursors) that are not biologically active (preprohormone) and cleaved in the ER to form smaller prohormones. These are then transferred to the Golgi apparatus for packing into secretory vesicles. In this process, enzymes in the vesicles cleave the prohormones to produce smaller, biologically active hormones and inactive fragments. Vesicles are stored into cytoplasm and secretion of the hormones occur by exocytosis.The peptide/protein hormones are :?Hypothalamus :- Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), coicotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), Growth-hormone releasing hormone (GHRh), Growth hormone inhibitory hormone (GHIn), i.e., somatostatin, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).Anterior pituitary :- Growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone (THS) or thyrotropin, adrenocoicotropin hormone (ACTH), prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leutinizing hormone (LH).Posterior pituitary : - Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)/vasopressin, oxytocin.Thyroid gland : - CalcitoninPancreas : - Insulin, glucagon.Parathyroid : - ParathormonePlacenta : - Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), Human somatomammotropin.Kidney : - Renin, erythropoietinHea : - Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)Stomach : - GastrinSmall intestine : - Secretin, Cholecystokinin (CCK)Adipocytes : - LeptinAngiotensin IISome of these peptide hormones are glycoproteins, i.e., they have sugar associated with proteins. Glycoprotein hormones are FSH, LH, TSH, human chorionic gonadotropin, erythropoietin.2) Steroid hormonesThese hormones are synthesized from cholesterol. Once they are synthesized, they are simply diffuse across the cell membrane (because they are lipid soluble) and enter the interstitial fluid and then the blood. Thus, they are not stored.Steroid hormones are : ?Adrenal coex : - Coisol (Glucocoicoids), Aldosterone (mineralocoicoids).Gonads : - Testosterone, estrogen, progesterone.Kidney : - 1, 25 - Dihydroxycholecalciferol3) Amine hormonesThese hormones are derivatives of amino acid tyrosine.

The internalized shiga toxin hydrolyse the ribosomes, preventing fuher protein synthesis. Shiga toxin is composed of two distinct peptide subunits: The first located on the larger A subnit is an N-glycosidase that hydrolyzes adenine from specific sites of ribosomal RNA of the mammalian 60s ribosomal subunit, irreversibly inhibiting protein synthesis. The second is a binding site on the B subunit that recognizes glycolipids of target cell membranes (glycolipid Gb 3).

Polymer of fructose,Dextrose,Cellulose,Inulin,Glycogen,"Ans. c (Inulin) (Ref. Ganong.-23rd/Ch. 38. 26th/pg. 105).Substances Used to Measure GFRIn addition to the requirement that it be freely filtered and neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a substance suitable for measuring the GFR should be nontoxic and not metabolized by the body. Inulin, a polymer of fructose with a molecular weight of 5200 that is found in dahlia tubers, meets these criteria in humans and most animals and is extensively used to measure GFR. Radioisotopes such as 51Cr-EDTA are also used, but inulin remains the standard substance. In practice, a loading dose of inulin is administered intravenously, followed by a sustaining infusion to keep the arterial plasma level constant. After the inulin has equilibrated with body fluids, an accurately timed urine specimen is collected and a plasma sample obtained halfway through the collection. Plasma and urinary inulin concentrations are determined and the clearance calculated. The GFR in a healthy person of average size is approximately 125 mL/min.CLASSIFICATION OF IMPORTANT SUGARS AldosesKetosesTrioses (C3H6O3)GlyceroseDihydroxyacetoneTetroses (C4H8O4)ErythroseErythrulosePentoses (C5Hl0O5)RiboseRibuloseHexoses (C6H12O6)GlucoseFructoseHexoses of Physiologic ImportanceSugarSourceImportanceClinical significanceD-GlucoseFruit juices.

Erythrocyte transketolase activity is seen in which vitamin?,Riboflavin,Thiamine,Folic acid,Niacine,"Transketolase is an enzyme of both the pentose phosphate pathway in all organisms and the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis. It catalyzes two impoant reactions, which operate in opposite directions in these two pathways. In the first reaction of the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the cofactor thiamine diphosphate accepts a 2-carbon fragment from a 5-carbon ketose (D-xylulose-5-P), then transfers this fragment to a 5-carbon aldose (D-ribose-5-P) to form a 7-carbon ketose (sedoheptulose-7-P). The abstraction of two carbons from D-xylulose-5-P yields the 3-carbon aldose glyceraldehyde-3-P. In the Calvin cycle, transketolase catalyzes the reverse reaction, the conversion of sedoheptulose-7-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P to pentoses, the aldose D-ribose-5-P and the ketose D-xylulose-5-P.The second reaction catalyzed by transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway involves the same thiamine diphosphate-mediated transfer of a 2-carbon fragment from D-xylulose-5-P to the aldose erythrose-4-phosphate, affording fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-P.

Shine dalgarno sequence in prokaryotes is associated with which of the following?,Transcription,Translation,Replication,Translocation,"Shine dalgarno sequence is a ribosomal binding site in the mRNA generally located 8 base pairs upstream of the sta codon AUG. This sequence helps in recruiting the ribosome to the mRNA to initiate protein synthesis by aligning it with the sta codon. Thus this sequence is needed in initation stage of translation. Mutations in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence can reduce translation. There is a complementary sequence called anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence located at the 3' end of the 16S rRNA in the ribosome. The eukaryotic equivalent of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is called the Kozak sequence. Ref: Textbook of Biochemistry By D M Vasudevan, 3rd Edition, Page 357",B

The best-characterized is an autosomal recessive condition called familial Mediterranean fever. This is a febrile disorder characterized by attacks of fever accompanied by inflammation of serosal surfaces, includ- ing peritoneum, pleura, and synol membrane. This dis- order is encountered largely in persons of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. It is associated with widespread tissue involvement indistinguishable from reactive systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid fibril proteins are made up of AA proteins, suggesting that this form of amyloidosis is related to the recurrent bouts of inflamma- tion that characterize this disease. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever is called pyrin and encodes a protein that is a component of the inflammasome (Chapter 2). Patients have gain-of-function mutations in pyrin that result in constitutive overproduction of the pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and persistent inflammation. In contrast with familial Mediterranean fever, a group of autosomal dominant familial disorders is characterized by deposition of amyloid predominantly in the peripheral and autonomic nerves. These familial amyloidotic poly- neuropathies have been described in kindreds in different pas of the world--for example, in Pougal, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. As mentioned previously, the fibrils in these familial polyneuropathies are made up of mutant forms of transthyretin (ATTRs).",B

Gentian violet colouration of gram-positive bacteria is due to -,Peptidoglycan,Capsule,Cell membrane,None of the above,"GRAM STAINING 
The gram stain differentiates bacteria into two broad groups
1. Gram-positive â Resist decolourization and retain primary stain, appear violet.
2. Gram-negative â Decolourised by organic solvents, and therefore, take the counterstain, appearing red. Smear stained with gentian violet (primary stain)

â Counterstaining by carbol fuchsin
â â â Retain primary stain (violet)
â Gram-positive Take colour of counterstain (red)
â Gram-negativeÂ 
Why do gram-positive organisms retain primary stain, but not gram-negative organisms.

Â In gram-positive bacteria, there is a thick layer of peptidoglycan (cell wall) just outside the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane.
Â This thick wall traps the primary stain (crystal violet) which is not decolorized by ethanol.
Â In gram-negative bacteria this peptidoglycan (cell wall) layer is thin and just outside this peptidoglycan layer is outer cell membrane (which is not present in gram-positive bacteria).
Â This outer cell membrane is partially dissolved by ethanol, thus washing out the crystal violet and allowing the counterstain to take",A

Which of the following bacteria act by increasing cAMP.,Vibrio cholera,Staphylococcus aureus,E. coli heat stable toxin,Salmonella,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Vibrio cholera Cholera produces a potent enterotoxin known as cholera toxin.This toxin consists of five B subunits and a single A subunit and has structural, functional and antigenic similarity to heat-labile toxin expressed by strains of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coltThe A subunit of the toxin is made up of two peptides (A1 and A2), linked by a single disulphide bridge.The B subunit binds to sugar residues of ganglioside GM1on the cells lining the villi and crypt of the small intestine (V. cholera never invades the intestinal epithelium but remain within the lumen and secretes the cholera toxin).It is believed that the insertion of the B subunit into the host cell membrane forms a transmembrane channel through which a toxic A subunit can pass into the cytoplasm.The cholera enterotoxin causes the transfer of adenosine diphosphoribose (ADP ribose) from nicotinamide ademine dinucleotide (NAD} to a regulatory protein, which is part of the adenylate cyclase enzyme responsible for the generation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).The result is irreversible activation of adenylate cyclase and overproduction of cAMP.This in turn causes inhibition of uptake of Na+ and Cl- ions by cells lining the villi, together with hypersecretion of Cl- and HCO3-ions.This blocks the uptake of water which normally accompanies Na+ and Cl- absorption and there is passive net outflow of water across mucosal cells leading to serious loss of water and electrolytes.Heat stable toxin of E.coli acts through cGMP.",A

The graph below depicts a polymerase chain reaction in,DNA PCR,PCR,Nested PCR,Real time PCR,"A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), also called real-time polymerase chain reaction, is a laboratory technique of molecular biology based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is used to amplify and simultaneously quantify a targeted DNA molecule. For one or more specific sequences in a DNA sample, quantitative PCR enables both detection and quantification. The quantity can be either an absolute number of copies or a relative amount when normalized to DNA input or additional normalizing genes. The procedure follows the general principle of polymerase chain reaction; its key feature is that the amplified DNA is detected as the reaction progresses in 'real time'. This is a new approach compared to standard PCR, where the product of the reaction is detected at its end. Two common methods for the detection of products in quantitative PCR are: (1) non-specific fluorescent dyes that intercalate with any double-stranded DNA, and (2) sequence-specific DNA probes consisting of oligonucleotides that are labelled with a fluorescent repoer which permits detection only after hybridization of the probe with its complementary sequence to quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding RNA in cells or tissues.",D

Impoant role of distal tubule of kidney in acid-base balance ?,Secretion of Ammonia,Secretion of bicarbonate,Secretion of HCl,Absorption of Ammonia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Secretion of AmmoniaThe H+ ions secreted into the tubule are mopped up by urinary buffers present in the tubular fluid. The three impoant buffers are : -i) Bicarbonate buffer : - Present in proximal segments (Proximal tubules, Thick ascending limb). It is nothing else but filtered HCO3- ions which react with H+ to form H2CO3. This is the most impoant buffer in proximal tubules.ii) Phosphate buffer : - Especially impoant in distal tubules.iii) Ammonia buffers : - Bind to H+ and produce ammonium ion (H+ + NH3 = NH4). The reaction with NH3 occurs in the proximal and distal tubules but the main buffering mechanism is active in distal tubule and this is the most impoant buffer in distal tubule.Thus, these buffers neutralize H+ in the tubules and in exchange HCO2 is reabsorbed. In case of bicarbonate buffer all filtered bicarbonates are reabsorbed. In case of ammonia and phosphate buffers, new HCO3 is generated due to secretion of W. So, ammonia and phosphate buffers are excreted in exchange of HCO3 absorption.",A

Hepatic encephalopathy is caused by an increase of -,Urea,Glutamate,Ammonia,Fattyacid,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Ammonia* Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by altered level of consciousness, caused by liver disorder.* Liver disorder is characterized by elevation of ammonia. As liver is considered with detoxification of ammonia to form urea, in liver failure ammonia level is elevated.* Hepatic encephalopathy basically presents with manifestations of CNS depression* Pathogenesis:# Ammonia crosses Blood Brain Barrier and is taken up astrocytes. Astrocytes contribute to 30% of cells in the Central Nervous System. Within astrocytes, as pKa of ammonia is very high, it sequestrates hydrogen ions to form ammonium ions. Ammonium ions are positively charged. Additionally, ammonia reacts with glutamate to form glutamine. Glutamine is also positively charged. Both ammonium ions and glutamine, being positively charged, they attract water (Ammonium and glutamine are osmotically active). This causes astrocytes swelling. Neuronal swelling in respiratory centre causes hyperventilation and the person presents with repiratory alkalosis.# As glutamate levels are low, the neuronal activity is reduced. This explains depression, coma and EEG abnormalities (characteristic slowing of waves with high amplitude)* Hence, all features of hepatic encephalopathy are explained by hyperammonemia.",C

Triiodothyronine circulates in the plasma, where it is boundmainly to thyroxine-binding globulin and thyroxine-binding prealbumin, proteins that protect the hormone from metabolism and excretion during its half-life of 2 days or less before it is degraded in the liver. The hormone is the most active thyroid hormone and affects all body processes, including gene expressions. It is a component of various drugs, such as liotrix, and liothyronine sodium, used in the treatment of hypothyroidism and simple goiter. Normal adult blood levels are110 to 230 ng/dL.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology; 24th edition; page no-347",D

Which of the following group of proteins assist in the folding of other proteins?,Proteases,Proteosomes,Templates,Chaperones,"Chaperones are proteins that play a role in proper folding of other proteins without themselves being components of latter. Chaperones are proteins that play a role in proper folding of other proteins. Chaperones are proteins that play a role in the assembly and proper folding of synthesized proteins so that the latter proteins gain biological activity. These proteins enable proper folding of other proteins without themselves being components of the latter. Propeies of Chaperone Protein: Present in a wide range of species from bacteria to humans. Many are so-called Heat shock proteins (HSP) Some are inducible by conditions that cause unfolding of newly synthesized proteins (e.g., elevated temperature and various chemicals) They bind to predominantly hydrophobic regions of unfolded and aggregated proteins. They act in pa as a quality control or editing mechanism for detecting misfolded or otherwise defective proteins. Substantial energy as ATP is required during folding of proteins by chaperones ATP is required for protein-chaperone interaction Found in various cellular compaments such as cytosol, mitochondria, and the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Examples of Chaperone proteins: BIP (immunoglobulin binding protein) GRP94 (glucose-regulated protein) Calnerin Calreticulin Examples of Chaperone Enzymes: PDI (Protein Disulphide Isomerase) PPI ( Peptidyl-prolylics-transisomerase) Misfolded proteins can lead to neurodegenrative diseases called Prion diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and Kuru in human.

Causes x Chronic frontal sinusitis which eventually suppurates and extends into subperiosteal region. x Trauma--subperiosteal haematoma. x Chronic suppurative otitis media. Features x Pain and boggy swelling in frontal region which is warm, tender. x Toxicity and drowsiness. x Pitting scalp oedema is typical. x Investigations:  Total leucocyte count--increased. ESR--raised.  X-ray skull. CT scan. x Differential diagnosis: Secondaries in the skull or brain. Complications Osteomyelitis of frontal bone. Spread of infection into intracranial cavity leads to intracranial abscess (Extradural or subdural abscess) (dumb-bell abscess). So may present with features of raised intracranial tension like headache, coning and convulsions. Pott's Puffy tumor can be associated with coical vein throm- bosis, epidural brain abscess/subdural empyema. The cause of vein thrombosis is explained by diplopic veins in frontal bone, which communicates with the dural venous plexus; septic thrombi can potentially evolve from foci within the frontal sinus and propagate through this venous system. Treatment x Antibiotics and drainage under general anaesthesia before it spreads into cranial cavity. x Once it extends into cranial cavity, it is treated accordingly by formal neurosurgical decompression (often using Dandy's brain cannula). x Osteomyelitis of skull bones requires radical removal with recon- struction of skull defect.

"In Ulnar nerve injury in arm, all of the following are seen except:",Hypothenar atrophy,Adduction of thumb,Loss of sensation of medial 1/3 of the hand,Claw hand,"Adduction of thumb Course and branches of Ulnar nerve Ulnar nerve arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus (C8 & T1)In the arnz, no cutaneous or muscular branches arise.As the nerve enters the forearm from behind the medial epicondyle, it supplies- Flexor carpi ulnaris and- Medial half of the flexor digitorum profundusIn the distal third of the forearm, it gives off its palmar and posterior cutaneous branches.The palmar cutaneous branch supplies- The skin over the hypothenar eminenceThe posterior cutaneous branch supplies- The skin over the medial 1/3 of the dorsum of the hand and- Medial 11/2 fingersThe ulnar nerve enters the palm by passing superficial to the flexor retinaculum and divides into its superficial and deep terminal branches.The superficial terminal branch supplies - The palmaris brevis and the skin of the palmar surface of the medial 11/2 fingers, including their nail beds.The deep terminal branch supplies- all the muscles of the hand except the muscles of the thenar eminence and the first two lumbricals, which are supplied by the median nerve Branches of Ulnar NerveMuscularCutaneous- Flexor carpi ulnaris- Medial 1/3 of the palmar and dorsal- Medial half of flexor digitorum profundusaspect of hand- Palmaris brevis- Medial 1 1/2 fingers including the dorsal- Hypothenar eminence musclesdistal phalanges and nail beds.- Medial two lumbricals - All 4 dorsal interossei - All 4 palmar interossei - Adductor pollicis Injury to the Ulnar nerve Ulnar nerve is most commonly injured at the elbow, where it lies behind the medial epicondyle and at the wrist where it lies in front of flexor retinaculum.In high ulnar nerve injury at or proximal to elbow, all the muscles supplied by the ulnar nerve in the forearm and hand are paralyzed whereas in low ulnar nerve palsy, there is sparing of the forearm muscles (in flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus). Sensory deficit are same in both high & low ulnar nerve injury.Clinical findings in injury at Elbow Motor- Flexion of the wrist joint results in abduction d/t paralysis of flexor carpi ulnaris- Medial border of the front of the forearm will show flattening owing to the wasting of the underlying ulnaris and profundus muscles.- The patient is unable to adduct and abduct the fingers d/t paralysis of the interossei (Palmar interossei adduct the fingers - PAD. Dorsal interossei abduct the fingers - DAB). They can be tested by Egawa's Test and Card test. Egawa's Test: (for dorsal interossei)The patient is asked to abduct his fingers, with the hand kept flat on the table, palmar surface down. Card Test: (for palmar interrossei)The patient is asked to hold a card between his two extended fingers. Examiner tries to pull the card out.- Pt. is unable to adduct the thumb because of paralysis of adductorpollicis. This can be checked by Froment's sign or the 'book test'.Froment's sign/book sign: (for adductorpollicis)The patient is asked to grasp a book between the thumb and index finger. Due to paralysis of the adductor pollicis, he does so by strongly contracting the flexor pollicis Langus and thus flexing the terminal phalanx of thumb (A normal person would keep his thumb extended).- The metacarpophalangeal joints become hyperextended because of the paralysis of the lumbricals and interossei muscles, which normally flex these joints. As the first and second lumbricals are not paralyzed, being supplied by the median nerve, the hyperextension of the metacarpophalangeal joints is most prominent in the fouh and fifth fingers. The interphalangeal joints are flexed, owing again to the paralysis of the lumbricals and interossei muscles which normally extend these joints. In long standing cases the hand assumes the characteristic 'claw' deformity (main en griffe)- Wasting of the paralyzed muscle result in flattening of the hypothenar eminence and loss of the convex curve of the medial border of the hand.- Dorsum of the hand shows hollowing between the metacarpal bones d/t atrophy of the dorsal interossei muscle.Sensory- Loss of sensations over medial 1/3 hand and 11/2 digits.Vasomotor changes- The skin areas involved in sensory loss are warmer and drier than normal because of the aeriolar dilatation and absence of sweating resulting from loss of sympathetic tone.Clinical findings in injury at WristThe small muscles of the hand will be paralyzed and show wasting except for the muscle of the thenar eminence and the first two lumbricalsThe claw hand is much more obvious in wrist lesions because the flexor digitorutn profundus muscle is not paralyzed causing marked flexion of the terminal phalanges Sensory loss and Vasomotor change are almost similar to high ulnar nerve injury..",B

First substrate of Kreb&;s cycle is,Pyruvate,Glycine,HCI,Lipoprotein,"Acetyl CoA enters the cycle and is completely oxidized. During this process, energy is trapped. The sources of acetyl CoA are shown in Figure 18.1. Pyruvate derived from glycolysis is oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (Fig. 9.22). This is the link between the TCA cycle and glycolysis. The pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction occurs in the mitochondria. Pyruvate with the help of a carrier can enter the mitochondria from the cytoplasm. The acetyl CoA derived from beta-oxidation is formed in the mitochondria itself.

Receptor for inverse stretch reflex ?,Muscle spindle,Extrafusal fibers,Intrafusal fibers,Golgi tendon organ,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Golgi tendon argan Inverse stretch reflex (golgi tendon reflex) Golgi tendon reflex is a bisynaptic reflex, initiated by the Golgi tendon organ located in muscle tendons. This organ consists of a net-like (ramified) collection of knobby nerve endings among the fascicles of a tendon. There are 3-25 muscle fiber per golgi tendon organ. Golgi tendon organs are also stretch receptors. However, unlike the muscle spindle which acts as a length detecter, the Golgi-tendon organ acts as a muscle tension-detector. This difference in sensory function occurs because muscle spindle is located in parallel to the muscle fibers (extrafusal fibers) while the Golgi tendon organ is located in series to the muscle fibers (extrafusal fibers). Therefore, Golgi tendon organs are stimulated by both passive stretch and contraction of muscle (in contrast to muscle spindle which is stimulated by passive stretch but is inhibited by active contraction of muscle). Stimuli for golgi tendon reflex are both passive strech and active contraction of muscle. The golgi tendon organ is innervated by Aa sensory (afferent) fibers (type lb sensory). These afferent fibers terminate on an inhibitory interneuron in dorsal horn of grey matter in the spinal cord. These inhibitory interneuron terminates on the a-motor neuron (same a-motor neuron on which Ia (Aa) afferent of stretch reflex terminates) and has inhibitory effect on a-motor neuron. So, activation of Golgi tendon reflex results in relaxation of muscle.",D

A 63 year old male with a 75 pack year history of smoking and marked chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) develops fevers and a persistent cough frequently tinged with blood. Chest x-ray reveals a complex cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. Bronchoscopic examination identifies a large lung abscess from which pure Fusobacterium nucleatum is cultured. What is the most likely source of the Fusobacterium?,Blood,Infected aerosols,Oral cavity,Stomach,"Anaerobic lung abscesses commonly arise from aspirated oral secretions in patients with compromised neurological status (e.g., anesthesia, coma, intoxication), or in individuals with a depressed cough reflex. The most common anaerobic organisms isolated from lung abscesses include Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Peptococcus species, all of which are typical oral flora. Bloodborne pathogens producing lung abscesses probably originate as emboli from vegetations on the right hea. The most likely pathogens in endocarditis are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species; Fusobacterium would be very unusual. Fusobacterium usually is not pathogenic and lives in a commensal relationship with the host. Infective aerosols generally contain organisms that are intrinsically pathogenic (e.g., mycobacteria, influenza virus). It is the acidity of the gastric aspirate that most seriously injures the lung, not the gastric bacteria. Fusobacterium do inhabit the gastrointestinal tract, but ble bacteria are much more likely to be transmitted from the oral secretions than from the stomach . Ref: Brooks G.F. (2013). Chapter 21.

Internal carotid artery crosses -,Sigmoid sinus,Straight sinus,Cavernous sinus,Sagittal sinus,"Ans. C. Cavernous sinusThe internal carotid artery arises from the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, ascends in the neck and enters the carotid canal of the temporal bone. Its subsequent course is said to have petrous, cavernous and intracranial parts.Petrous parta. The petrous part of the internal carotid artery ascends in the carotid canal, curves anteromedially and then superomedially above the cartilage that fills the foramen lacerum, and enters the cranial cavity.b. It lies at first anterior to the cochlea and tympanic cavity, and is separated from the latter and the pharyngotympanic tube by a thin, bony lamella that is cribriform in the young and partly absorbed in old age. Further anteriorly, it is separated from the trigeminal ganglion by the thin roof of the carotid canal, although this is often deficient. The artery is surrounded by a venous plexus and by the carotid autonomic plexus, derived from the internal carotid branch of the superior cervical ganglion.c. The petrous part of the artery gives rise to two branches. The caroticotympanic artery is a small, occasionally double, vessel which enters the tympanic cavity by a foramen in the carotid canal and anastomoses with the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery and the stylomastoid artery.d. The pterygoid artery is inconsistent: when present, it enters the pterygoid canal with the nerve of the same name, and anastomoses with a (recurrent) branch of the greater palatine artery.Cavernous parta. The cavernous part of the internal carotid artery ascends to the posterior clinoid process. It turns anteriorly to the side of the sphenoid within the cavernous sinus and then curves up medial to the anterior clinoid process, to emerge through the dural roof of the sinus. The oculomotor, trochlear, ophthalmic and abducens nerves are lateral to it within the cavernous sinus.b. This part of the artery gives off a number of small vessels. Cavernous branches supply the trigeminal ganglion, the walls of the cavernous and inferior petrosal sinuses and the nerves contained therein. A minute meningeal branch passes over the lesser wing of the sphenoid to supply the dura mater and bone in the anterior cranial fossa and also anastomoses with a meningeal branch of the posterior ethmoidal artery. Numerous small hypophysial branches supply the neurohypophysis, and are of particular importance because they form the pituitary portal system.Intracranial parta. After piercing the dura mater, the internal carotid artery turns back below the optic nerve to run between it and the oculomotor nerve. It reaches the anterior perforated substance at the medial end of the lateral fissure and terminates by dividing into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries.b. Several preterminal vessels leave the cerebral portion of the internal carotid. The ophthalmic artery arises from the anterior part of the internal carotid as it leaves the cavernous sinus, often at the point of piercing the dura, and enters the orbit through the optic canal.c. The posterior communicating artery runs back from the internal carotid above the oculomotor nerve, and anastomoses with the posterior cerebral artery (a terminal branch of the basilar artery), thereby contributing to the circulus arteriosus around the interpeduncular fossa.d. The posterior communicating artery is usually very small. However, sometimes it is so large that the posterior cerebral artery is supplied via the posterior communicating artery rather than from the basilar artery ('fetal posterior communicating artery'); it is often larger on one side only. Small branches from its posterior half pierce the posterior perforated substance together with branches from the posterior cerebral artery.e. Collectively they supply the medial thalamic surface and the walls of the third ventricle. The anterior choroidal artery leaves the internal carotid near its posterior communicating branch and passes back above the medial part of the uncus.f. It crosses the optic tract to reach and supply the crus cerebri of the midbrain, then turns laterally, recrosses the optic tract, and gains the lateral side of the lateral geniculate body, which it supplies with several branches. It finally enters the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle via the choroidal fissure and ends in the choroid plexus.g. This small, but important, vessel also contributes to the blood supply of the globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, tuber cinereum, red nucleus, substantia nigra, posterior limb of the internal capsule, optic radiation, optic tract, hippocampus and the fimbria of the fornix.",C

The most impoant factor controlling the rate of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is the:,Concentration of inorganic phosphate.,Concentration of O2.,Number of protons pumped.,Level of ADP.,"Respiratory control refers to the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation by the cellular ADP levels. Electrons do not flow through the electron transpo chain to O2 unless ADP is simultaneously phosphorylated to ATP. This only occurs when there is a need to synthesize ATP. The rate of O2 use increases significantly in experiments where ADP is added to isolated mitochondria. Oxidative phosphorylation requires NADH, O2, ADP, and Pi, but ADP is the most impoant in terms of regulation. ADP increases as ATP is utilized, therefore, high ADP indicates low energy charge in the cell. Ref: Botham K.M., Mayes P.A. (2011). Chapter 13. The Respiratory Chain & Oxidative Phosphorylation.

Fetal Hb shows high pO2 saturation compared to adult Hb because -,Affinity' to binding to DPG is different in fetal Hb,Right shift to Oxygen dissociation curve,Acidic environment,Cooperative binding,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Affinity to binding to DPG is different in fetal Hb o Make it very clear in mind that higher affinity' of fetal hemoglobin for oxygen is due to low affinity of HbF for 2,3- DPG (not due to decreased 2, 3-DPG concentration). HbF does not combines to 2, 3-DPG as avidly as adult hemoglobin.'Fetal hemoglobin is left - shifted because it has a low affinity' for DPG', --Principles of medical physiology''It is worth noting that DPG does not combine with fetal hemoglobin. That is perhaps one reason why HbF has greater affin ity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin (HbF) '.-- Understanding of medical physiology'Fetal hemoglobin binds less 2-3 DPG it has consequently a greater affinity for O2' -- Pediatric physiologyo All other textbooks have mentioned the same thing.o So, high affinity of HbF to O2 is due to low affinity of HbF for 2,3 DPG (and not due to decreased 2,3-DPG concentration).Effect of 2-3 diphosphoglvcerete (2.3 PPG)o Another important factor which influences oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is 2,3 DPG in RBC. DPG is an optional by-product of the glycolytic pathway. DPG binds with deoxygenated hemoglobin but not with oxygenated hemoglobin. Therefore raised DPG concentration releases oxygen from oxyhemoglobin by shifting the following reversible reaction to the right: -HbO2 + DPG - Hb - DPG + O2o One molecule of DPG binds with one mole of deoxyhemoglobin.o That is why in the presence of raised DPG concentration, less oxygen can combine with hemoglobin at a given PO2. Hence an increase in DPG concentration shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right. Thus 2,3 DPG causes delivery (unloading) of O2 to the tissues.o Factors which increases 2,3 DPG level and therefore lower the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin (right shift of O2 dissociation curve and increased delivery of oxygen to tissues) are : -# Hypoxia# High altitude# Alkalosis# Exercise# Pregnancy# Anemia# Hormones (thyroid, GH, androgen)# Cyanotic congenital heart disease# Chemical agents (Inosine, Pyruvate, PEP, phosphate, dihydroxyacetone)o Factors which decrease 2,3 DPG levels and therefore increase oxygen a ffinity of hemoglobin (left shift of O2 dissociation curve and decreased delivery' of O2 to the tissues) are : - Stored blood, and fetal hemoglobin (HbF).o Fetal hemoglobin has considerably less afinity for 2,3 - DPG than does adult hemoglobin therefore fetal hemoglobin has greater affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin. In human blood, the affinity of fetal hemoglobin for 2,3-DPG is only about 40% that of adult hemoglobin. This makes fetal hemoglobin behave as if 2,3-DPG levels are low. Therefore, the oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the left. Although fetal red cells do contain 2,3 DPG, the poor binding of 2,3-DPG by fetal hemoglobin is an important factor in facilitating transport of oxygen across the placenta from mother to fetus. On the maternal side of the placenta, the reduction of hemoglobin effectively shifts the curve to the right, increasing oxygen release. On the fetal side, 2,3-DPG does not interfere with the affinity' of fetal hemoglobin for oxygen and thus the uptake of oxygen by fetal erythrocytes.",A

Receptor for vitamin B12-IF complex is located in,Ileum,Colon,Jejunum,Duodenum,"Methyl-B12 is absorbed by two processes. The first is an intestinal mechanism using intrinsic factor through which 1-2 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a diffusion process by which approximately 1% of the remainder is absorbed. The human physiology of vitamin B12 is complex, and therefore is prone to mishaps leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. Protein-bound vitamin B12 must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. Gastric acid releases the vitamin from food paicles; therefore antacid and acid-blocking medications (especially proton-pump inhibitors) may inhibit absorption of B12. B12 taken in a low-solubility, non-chewable supplement pill form may bypass the mouth and stomach and not mix with gastric acids, but acids are not necessary for the absorption of free B12 not bound to protein; acid is necessary only to recover naturally-occurring vitamin B12 from foods. R-protein (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin) is a B12 binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands. It must wait to bind food-B12 until B12 has been freed from proteins in food by pepsin in the stomach. B12 then binds to the R-protein to avoid degradation of it in the acidic environment of the stomach. This pattern of B12 transfer to a special binding protein secreted in a previous digestive step, is repeated once more before absorption. The next binding protein for B12 is intrinsic factor (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric parietal cells that is secreted in response to histamine, gastrin and pentagastrin, as well as the presence of food. In the duodenum, proteases digest R-proteins and release their bound B12, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B12). B12 must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal ileum of the small bowel only recognize the B12-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from catabolism by intestinal bacteria. Once the IF/B12 complex is recognized by specialized ileal receptors, it is transpoed into the poal circulation. The vitamin is then transferred to transcobalamin II (TC-II/B12), which serves as the plasma transpoer. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B12 and infantile megaloblastic anemia, and abnormal B12 related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B12 levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B12 complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be endocytosed. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a lysosome, and free B12 is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by ceain cellular enzymes.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 458",A

Acetyl CoA carboxylase is stimulated by all except-,Citrate,ATP,Insulin,Acyl CoA,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Acyl Co A* Acetyl coA carboxylase (ACC) is the rate limiting step of fatty acid synthesis.* ACC converts acetyl coA (the building block of fatty acid) to malonylcoA in the presence of ATP (source of energy), Biotin (coenzyme) and bicarbonate (source of CO2)* Acetyl CoA carboxylase is in a monomeric phosphorylated form when it is inactive. In the presence of signals of high energy, monomeric phosphorylated form gets converted into multimeric/ dephosphorylated form and it becomes active.* REGULATION OF ACC:# As ACC is the rate limiting enzyme of an anabolic pathway (Synthesis), it is stimulated by the anabolic hormone insulin. Insulin mediates its enzyme regulation of most of the metabolic pathways through Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A). PP2A dephosphorylates and stimulates Acetyl coA carboxylase.# Glucagon being a catabolic hormone, phosphorylates and inactivates ACC (Glucagon acts through protein kinase A and phosphorylates all enzymes)# Apart from being regulated by hormones through covalent modification, ACC is also allosterically regulated by citrate (tricarboxylic acid), Glutamate (diacarboxylicaminoacid), otherdicarboxylic acids & ATP. All these allosteric regulators stimulate the conversion of monomeric inactive ACC to a multimeric active form.

Minimum separable distance for two-point threshold test is greatest at?,Lips,Palm of hand,Back of scapula,Dorsum of hand,"The size of the receptive fields for light touch can be measured by the two-point threshold test. In this procedure, the two points on a pair of calipers are simultaneously positioned on the skin and one determines the minimum distance between the two caliper points that can be perceived as separate points of stimulation. This is called the two-point discrimination threshold.If the distance is very small, each caliper point touches the receptive field of only one sensory neuron. If the distance between stimulation points is less than this threshold, only one point of stimulation can be felt. Thus, the two-point discrimination threshold is a measure of tactile acuity. The magnitude of two-point discrimination thresholds varies from place to place on the body and is smallest where touch receptors are most abundant.Stimulus points on the back, for instance, must be separated by at least 65 mm before they can be distinguished as separate, whereas on the fingeips two stimuli are recognized if they are separated by as little as 2 mm. Blind individuals benefit from the tactile acuity of fingeips to facilitate the ability to read Braille; the dots forming Braille symbols are separated by 2.5 mm.

This is found to be because lysosomal enzymes are not being directed to the lysosomes. When the lysosomal enzymes are examined it is found that their protein structure is normal, but the carbohydrate chains attached to the enzymes terminate with a mannose, whereas in normal lysosomal enzymes the carbohydrates terminate with mannose-6-phosphate.

Enzyme does not act by ?,Increasing the rate of reaction,Catalyzing the reaction,Increasing activation energy,Forming non-covalent interactions,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Increasing activation energyEnzymes increase the rate of a biochemical reaction, therefore they are called catalysts of reaction.Now the question arises that how does they do that?In a chemical reaction, the substrate has to be conveed to a higher energy form (called transition form) before it can form the reaction products.The transition state is structurally an intermediate between the substrate and the product, and represents the highest energy arrangement of atoms. Therefore, it is unstable; once formed, it decomposes almost immediately to form the reaction product.So, this high energy intermediate acts as energy barrier, separating the substrates and the products.This barrier, called the free energy of action, is the energy difference between the energy of the substrates and high energy intermediates.In other words, initially some energy must be put into the substrate for conversion into transition state (high-energy intermediate); this is the free energy of activation.The enzymes speed up the chemical reaction by lowering the magnitude of the activation energy barrier, i.e., free energy of activation.Most enzyme-substrate combinations are mostly due to weak non-covalent interactions like hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interactions, ionic (electrostate) interaction and Vander waals forces.However, covalent catalysis involves the formation of a covalent bond between the amino acyl residues of active site of enzyme and substrate.Covalent catalysis is used by serine proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsine) which bind their substrate covalently at serine side chain.",C

All are true about histological feature of Kaposi's sarcoma except,Microscopically lesion similar to granulation tissue,Dilated and irregular blood vessels with interspersed infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma,Atypical blood vessels having solid spindle appearance,Nodules is the intial lesion of Kaposi's sarcoma,"Ref Robbins 9/e p254,8/e p529; 7/e p549 Neoplasms. Patients with AIDS have a high incidence of ceain tumors, paicularly Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and cervical cancer in women. The common feature of all of these diverse neoplasms is that the tumor cells in each are typically infected by an oncogenic virus. The basis of the increased risk of virus-associated malignancy is multifactorial, but defective T cell immunity is believed to be the predominant contributor. Kaposi sarcoma, a vascular tumor that is otherwise rare in the United States (Chapter 9), was once the most common neoplasm in AIDS patients but its incidence has decreased significantly with anti-retroviral therapy. The tumor is far more common among homosexual or bisexual males than in intravenous drug abusers or patients belonging to other risk groups. The lesions can arise early, before the immune system is compromised, or in advanced stages of HIV infection. Unlike the lesions in sporadic cases of Kaposi sarcoma, those that occur in patients with AIDS are multi- centric and tend to be more aggressive; they can affect the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, and lungs. The lesions contain spindle cells that share features with endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells and are believed to be lymphatic endothelial cells or mesenchymal cells that can form vascular channels. In dif- ferent patients, the lesions are monoclonal or oligoclonal or even polyclonal, an unusual feature shared by other pro- liferations driven by oncogenic viruses, such as ceain EBV-related B cell proliferations. Kaposi sarcoma is caused by a herpesvirus called Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). The mechanisms by which the virus causes the vascular proliferation are unceain. One hypothesis is that KSHV infects lymphatic endothelial or other cells, and in conce with cytokines produced by HIV-infected immune cells, stimulates proliferation of the endothelial cells. The KSHV genome contains homologues of several human oncogenes and cytokines that may contribute to the growth and survival of the proliferating vessels. B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas constitute the second most common type of AIDS-associated tumors. These tumors are highly aggressive, occur most frequently in severely immunosuppressed patients, and involve many extranodal sites. The brain is the most common extranodal site in late- stage HIV infection, and hence primary lymphoma of the brain is considered an AIDS-defining condition. Close to 100% of these brain lymphomas are EBV-related. In com- parison only 30% to 40% of lymphomas occuring earlier in the course of HIV infection are EBV-related, emphasizing the contribution of other factors, such as chronic B cell hyperstimulation, to lymphoma risk in HIV-infected indi- viduals. Another, less common AIDS-related lymphoma is primary effusion lymphoma, which grows exclusively in body cavities, manifesting as pleural, peritoneal, or peri- cardial effusions. This rare tumor is always associated with KSHV, and in many cases the tumor cells are co-infected with both KSHV and EBV. The incidence of cervical carcinoma also is increased in patients with AIDS. This correlation is attributable to the high prevalence of human papillomavirus infection among patients with AIDS, whose immune systems are compro- mised. This virus is believed to be intimately associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and its precur- sor lesions, cervical dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (Chapter 18). Hence, gynecologic examination should be pa of the routine evaluation in HIV-infected women. In general, the incidence of the classical 'AIDS-defining cancers'--Kaposi sarcoma, EBV-associated tumors, and cervical cancer--has decreased significantly with the use of antiretroviral therapy, but the relative incidence of other tumors considered 'non-AIDS-defining cancers' is ctually increasing. This latter group includes liver cancer, anal cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma, all of which are types of tumors associated with various viral infections.",D

A 62 year old man has a 25 year history of alcoholism and liver disease. He visits his physician complaining of pain and swelling of his legs. A decrease in which of the following is the most likely cause of the peripheral edema?,Capillary hydrostatic pressure,Interstitial colloid osmotic pressure,Interstitial hydrostatic pressure,Plasma colloid osmotic pressure,"The plasma colloid osmotic pressure is often low in alcoholics with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The diseased liver cannot produce adequate amounts of albumin, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of albumin in the plasma, i.e., hypoalbuminemia. Because about 75% of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure can be attributed to the presence of albumin in the plasma, the decrease in plasma albumin concentration that occurs in the latter stages of cirrhosis often leads to peripheral edema. Cirrhosis also causes excess fluid to accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites. In the case of ascites, the edema results not only from hypoalbuminemia, but also from poal vein obstruction (which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure) as well as the obstruction of lymphatic drainage of the liver. In fact, ascites is observed more often than peripheral edema in liver disease. A decrease in capillary hydrostatic pressure would tend to decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, and thereby oppose the development of edema. A decrease in the colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid would decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, thereby opposing the development of edema. A decrease in interstitial hydrostatic pressure would tend to increase fluid loss from the capillaries, but this cannot be considered a primary cause of edema because the interstitial hydrostatic pressure actually increases when a tissue becomes edematous.

After eating, blood glucose levels are only slightly elevated above the normal fasting levels before stabilizing at the fasting levels. The student indicates that he is not drinking or urinating excessively, but that he remembers that his mother had gestational diabetes when pregnant with him. This alteration in glucose homeostasis is best typified by which one of the following types of inheritance?",Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,Sex linked,Mitochondrial,"The patient is displaying the signs of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), which can be caused by a mutation in the pancreatic glucokinase gene, such that its Km is increased. The increase in the Km for glucokinase would lead to glucose only being metabolized at higher-than-normal levels. Once glucose is metabolized in the b cells of the pancreas, and adenosine triphosphate levels increase, then insulin can be released. The glucokinase mutation causes insulin release to occur at higher-than-normal glucose levels. The mother also expresses the mutant glucokinase gene. During pregnancy, the effect of placental hormones tends to inhibit insulin's action, and in a mother with MODY, in which insulin is not being released appropriately owing to the glucokinase mutation, blood glucose levels rise significantly during the pregnancy, leading to gestational diabetes. MODY, in terms of the glucokinase mutation, is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner.",A

Infection with which of the following agents is the most likely cause of these signs and symptoms?",Clostridium perfringens,HIV-1,Shigella dysenteriae,Staphylococcus aureus,"This patient has toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a multisystem syndrome caused by a toxin (TSST-1) formed by ceain strains of S. aureus. TSS usually affects several organ systems (gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, pulmonary) and can result in death. TSS has historically been associated with the use of tampons in young women, but can also occur in other patient populations. Fever, hypotension, diarrhea, and diffuse rash with desquamation of the hands and feet are common symptoms. Management of shock, renal failure, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are a priority if these conditions are present, in addition to appropriate antibacterial treatment.

The enzyme not present in the skeletal muscles :,Creatinine phosphokinase,Hexokinase,Phosphofructokinase,Glucose 6 phosphatase,"D i.e. Glucose -6 - phosphataseThe role of glycogen in liver is to provide free glucose for expo to maintain the blood glucose level; whereas in muscles the role of glycogen is to provide a source of glucose-6-PO4 for glycolysis (to supply ATP for muscle contraction).This difference of fate of glycogen in liver & muscle is d/t absence of glucose -6- phosphatase enzyme in muscleQ. Because of absence of this enzyme, which catalyzes the final step of glycogenolysis, glycogen in muscles can only be conveed upto glucose-6- phosphate. Hence muscle glycogenolysis does not contribute to blood glucose directlyQ. Instead, in muscle, this glucose -6-PO4 can not cross plasma membrane and enters glycolysis producing energy (3ATP) needed for muscle contraction. The gain of an extra (1) ATP is d/t bypass of 1st step of glycolysis which requires 1 ATP (If glycolysis stas from glucose only 2 ATPs are produced). Lactic acid produced d/t glycolysis crosses the plasma membrane & reaches liver to form glucose.In liver glucose -6. phosphate is transpoed by glucose- 6-phosphate translocase into endoplasmic reticulum, where it is conveed to glucose by glucose- 6- phosphatase (this enzyme is also used in last step of gluconeogenesis).

Amino acid carrying ammonia from muscle to liver-,Alanine,Glutamine,Arginine,Lysine,"Ans. is 'a' i.e.. Alanine o Transport of alanine from muscle to liver (glucose-alanine cycle) has two functions :-Providing substrate for giuconeogenesisTransport of ammonia (NH4+) to liver for urea synthesis.o During the first few days of starvation, there is a rapid breakdown of muscle protein, providing aminoacids for giuconeogenesis. The most important gluconeogenic amino acid is alanine0 (through glucose-alanine cycle). Alanine is released due to increased muscle protein breakdownQ and is transported to liver for giuconeogen-esis (glucose alanine cycle). The other important gluconeogenic amino acid in starvation is glutamine,o After some weeks of starvation, the rate of muscle breakdown decreases due to decreased need of glucose as a fuel for brain which has began using ketone bodies as a source of energy'. However, when the triacylglycerol stores are completely exhaused, muscle proteins once again enter in a stage of rapid depletion due to protein breakdown,o Alanine transport from muscle to liver has an important additional role, beside giuconeogenesis. Because muscle is incapable of synthesizing urea, most of the ammonia formed by protein catabolism is transferred to pyruvate to form alanine by transamination. Alanine is transported to liver where amino group of alanine is removed to form urea and the resulting pyruvate is converted to glucose by giuconeogenesis.o Thus, sources of alanine release from muscle are (i) Degradation of protein (ii) Transamination of pyruvate.o Besides alanine, lactate produced in muscles by anerobic use of glucose, also seves as a substrate for giuconeogenesis - cori cycle or lactic acid cycle.",A

Which of the following is the largest protein in the body that connects M line to Z line during active muscle contraction?,Actin,Desmin,Titin,All of above,"Ans. C. Titin. (Ref. Guyton & Hall's Textbook of Medical Physiology 11th/pg. 463)SarcomereThe portion of the myofibril (or of the whole muscle fiber) that lies between two successive Z discs is called a sarcomere. When the muscle fiber is contracted, the length of the sarcomere is about 2 micrometers. At this length, the actin filaments completely overlap the myosin filaments, and the tips of the actin filaments are just beginning to overlap one another.Titin# The side-by-side relationship between the myosin and actin filaments is difficult to maintain. This is achieved by a large number of filamentous molecules of a protein called titin. Each titin molecule has a molecular weight of about 3 million, which makes it one of the largest protein molecules in the body.Myosin Filament.# The myosin filament is composed of multiple myosin molecules, each having a molecular weight of about 480,000.# The myosin molecule is composed of six polypeptide chains--two heavy chains, each with a molecular wt of about 200,000, and four light chains with molecular weights of about 20,000 each.# The myosin filament is made up of 200 or more individual myosin molecules. The protruding arms and heads together are calledcross-bridges. Each cross-bridge is flexible at two points called hinges--one where the arm leaves the body of the myosin filament, and the other where the head attaches to the arm.# The total length of each myosin filament is uniform, almost exactly 1.6 micrometers. Note, however, that there are no cross-bridge heads in the very center of the myosin filament for a distance of about 0.2 micrometer because the hinged arms extend away from the center.# ATPase Activity of the Myosin Head. Another feature of the myosin head that is essential for muscle contraction is that it functions as an ATPase enzyme. As explained later, this property allows the head to cleave ATP and to use the energy derived from the ATP's high-energy phosphate bond to energize the contraction process.Actin Filament.# The actin filament is complex, composed of three protein components: actin, tropomyosin, and troponin.# The backbone of the actin filament is a double- stranded F-actin protein molecule. The two strands are wound in a helix in the same manner as the myosin molecule.# Each actin filament is about 1 micrometer long. The bases of the actin filaments are inserted strongly into the Z discs; Tropomyosin Molecules.# The actin filament also contains another protein, tropomyosin. Each molecule of tropomyosin has a molecular weight of 70,000 and a length of 40 nanometers. These molecules are wrapped spirally around the sides of the F-actin helix. In the resting state, the tropomyosin molecules lie on top of the active sites of the actin strands, so that attraction cannot occur between the actin and myosin filaments to cause contraction.Troponin and Its Role in Muscle Contraction.# Attached intermittently along the sides of the tropomyosin molecules are still other protein molecules called troponin.# One of the subunits (troponin I) has a strong affinity for actin, another (troponin T) for tropomyosin, and a third (troponin C) for calcium ions. This complex is believed to attach tropomyosin to the actin.# The strong affinity of the troponin for calcium ions is believed to initiate the contraction process.",C

"A previously healthy 11 year old girl develops a gastrointestinal infection with cramping and watery stools. After several days, she begins to pass blood per rectum, and is hospitalized for dehydration. In the hospital, she is noted to have decreasing urine output with rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Total blood count reveals anemia and thrombocytopenia, and the peripheral smear is remarkable for fragmented red cells (schistocytes). Infection with which of the following bacterial genera is most likely responsible for this syndrome?",Campylobacter,Clostridium,Salmonella,Shigella,"This patient has developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication of the Shiga toxin or Shiga-like toxin: exotoxins released by Shigella species and the enterohemorrhagic E.coli. HUS in children usually develops after a gastrointestinal or flu-like illness, and is characterized by bleeding, oliguria, hematuria and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Presumably the Shiga toxin is toxic to the microvasculature, producing microthrombi that consume platelets and RBCs, and may fragment the red cell membrane. The incorrect choices are all bacteria which may produce an enterocolitis, but do not elicit HUS. A long-term consequence of Campylobacter infection is a reactive ahritis or full-blown Reiter's syndrome. Clostridial enterocolitis is produced by Clostridium difficile, a normal inhabitant of the gut that produces pseudomembranous colitis when other gut flora are suppressed by treatment with antibiotics.

"When amphotericin B inhibits fungal growth, which mechanism is affected?",Inhibition of cell-wall synthesis,Inhibition of cytoplasmic membrane function,Inhibition of nucleic acid metabolism,Inhibition of protein synthesis,"Amphotericin B is a complex polyene that has no inhibitory effect against bacteria, but strongly inhibits several pathogenic fungi. Amphotericin B binds to sterols on the fungal cell membrane and disturbs cytoplasmic membrane function. Given intravenously as micelles of sodium deoxycholate dissolved in dextrose solution, the drug is widely distributed in tissues. It does not penetrate well to the cerebrospinal fluid. Once attached to the fungal membrane, an amphotericin pore is introduced. Small molecules and ions are lost, eventually resulting in cell death. Mammalian cells are relatively resistant to amphotericin because it binds weakly to the cholesterol in mammalian cell membranes.Amphotericin B is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent with activity against coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, sporotrichosis, cryptococcosis, mucormycosis, and candidiasis.Amphotericin B does not work by any of the other four antimicrobial mechanisms of action.",B

All the following are false regarding physiological dead space except,"In healthy adults, 20-50ml more than anatomical dead space",Detected by Bohr's method,10-15% of tidal volume,Increased by endotracheal intubation,"Ans: b {Detected by Bohr's method) Ref.Gonong 22ndPhysiological dead space is calculated by Bohr's method.In normal healthy adult, physiological dead space = anatomical dead space.Anatomical dead space in a healthy 70kg adult is 150 ml, which is 30% of tidal volume.Total dead space/ physiological dead space = Anatomical dead space + alveolar dead space.Anatomical dead space = The part of the respiratory system that is not available for gas exchange with pulmonary capillary blood. It is 150 ml.Alveolar dead space = Those alveoli that are non functioning and not receiving adequate blood flow.The total dead space can be calculated from the PCO2 of expired air, the PCO2 of arterial blood, and the tidal volume. The tidal volume (VT) times the PCO2 of the expired gas (PECO2) equals the arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) times the difference between the tidal volume and the dead space (VD) plus the PCO2 of inspired air (PICO2) times VD (Bohr's equation):PFCO2 x VT = PaCO2 x (VT - VD) + PICO2 x VDThe term PICO2 x VD is so small that it can be ignored and the equation solved for VD.",B

The rapid depolarization in cardiac muscle is due to,Ca++,Na++,K++,Mg++,"(B) Na++ # Resting membrane potential of individual mammalian cardiac muscle cells is about -90 mV (interior negative to exterior). Stimulation produces a propagated action potential that is responsible for initiating contraction. Depolarization proceeds rapidly, and an overshoot is present, as in skeletal muscle and nerve, but this is followed by a plateau before the membrane potential returns to the baseline. In mammalian hearts, depolarization lasts about 2 ms, but the plateau phase and repolarization last 200 ms or more. Repolarization is therefore not complete until the contraction is half over. With extracellular recording, the electrical events include a spike and a later wave that resemble the QRS complex and T wave of the ECG. As in other excitable tissues, changes in the external K+ concentration affect the resting membrane potential of cardiac muscle, whereas changes in the external Na+ concentration affect the magnitude of the action potential. Initial rapid depolarization and the overshoot (phase 0) are due to opening of voltage-gated Na+ channels similar to that occurring in nerve and skeletal muscle. Initial rapid repolarization (phase 1) is due to closure of Na+ channels. The subsequent prolonged plateau (phase 2) is due to a slower but prolonged opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Final repolarization (phase 3) to the resting membrane potential (phase 4) is due to closure of the Ca2+ channels and K+ efflux through various types of K+ channels. Voltage-gated Na+ channel in cardiac muscle has two gates--an outer gate that opens at the start of depolarization at a membrane potential of -70 to -80 mV; and an inner gate that then closes and precludes further influx until the action potential ends (Na+ channel inactivation). Slow Ca2+ channel is activated at a membrane potential of-30 to -40 mV. There are three types of K+ channels that proc jce repolarization. The first produces a transient, early outward current (lTO) that produces an early incomplete repolarizai on. Second is inwardly rectifying, ie, at plateau potentials it allows K+ influx but resists K+ efflux, and only at lower membrane potentials does it permit K+ efflux. Current it produces is called lKr. The third type is a slowly activating (delayed rectifying) type that produces a current called IKs. The sum of IKr and IKs is a small net outward current that increases with time and produces repolarization",B

Disorder shown in the Illustration is related to:,Mismatch repair,Base excision repair,Nucleotide excision repair,SOS repair,"Ans. C. Nucleotide Excision RepairDisorder shown: Xeroderma pigmentosuma. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of DNA repair in which the ability to repair damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light is deficient.b. In extreme cases, all exposure to sunlight must be forbidden, no matter how small; as such, individuals with the disease are often colloquially referred to as 'Moon child'.c. Multiple basal cell carcinomas (basaliomas) and other skin malignancies frequently occur at a young age in those with XP; metastatic malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the two most common causes of death in XP victims.d. This disease is present in both genders and in all races, with an incidence of 1:250,000 in the United States. XP is roughly six times more common in Japanese people than in other groups.e. Normally, damage to DNA in epidermal cells occurs during exposure to UV light. The absorption of the high-energy light leads to the formation of pyrimidine dimers, namely cyclo butane-pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine-6-4- pyrimidone photoproducts.f. In a healthy, normal human being, the damage is first excised by endonucleases. DNA polymerase then repairs the missing sequence, and ligase 'seals' the transaction.

Frame shift mutation causes -,Transversion,Transition,Termination of protein synthesis,Alteration of whole reading sequence,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Alteration of whole reading sequenceMutationso A mutation is apermanant change in the DMA.o Mutations that affect germ cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease.o Mutations that affect somatic cells are not transmitted to progeny but are important in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations,o Mutations may be classified into three categories -l.Gene mutationsThe vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutationsThese may of different types depending whether it involves complete gene or single base -(a) Point mutationo A single nucleotide base is substituted by a different base.o When a pyrimidine base is substituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine - Transition.o When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa - Transversion,o This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i.e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product.o Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation.o Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in b-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine,o Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon.o Example is b-thalassemia in which CAG codon in b-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation.(b) Deletion and insertionso Deletion or insertion of one or two base lead to alterations in the reading frame of the DNA strand - frame shift mutation.o If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three framshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized.(c) Trinucleotide repeat mutationo Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide.o In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain,o For example in fragile X-syndrome. CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG.Chnomosome mutationo Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome.Genome mutationo Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e.g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",D

A man cannot digest carbohydrate. The enzyme deficient is -,Lipase,Amylase,Pepsin,Trypsin,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Amylase o Principal enzyme involved in digestion of dietary carbohydrate is amylase.Digestion of carbohydrateso The most abundant carbohydrate in our food is starch. The other forms of carbohydrate which are consumed in substantial amounts are sucrose and lactose.o Starch is a polysaccharide composed entirely of glucose units linked by 1,4- alpha linkage and 1, 6 branching points. What it means that carbon atom -1 of a glucose unit is linked to carbon atom - 4 of the adjacent glucose unit, and that bond is of alpha - type. At the branching points, carbon atom-1 is linked to carbon atom-6 of the adjacent glucose unit.o Digestion of starch starts in the mouth itself by salivary amylase (ptylin). But the hydrolysis by salivary amylase cannot proceed much because the optimal pH for the reaction is 6-7 which is very different from the highly acidic environment of the stomach. The process is resumed by 'pancreatic amylase' in the small intestine. Amylase attacks only internal, 1-4 alpha glucose-glucose bondsQ but spares 1-6 linkages and terminal 1-4 alpha linkages. Hence the products of starch hydrolysis are maltose (a disaccharide, two glucose residues linked by 1:4 a bonds), maltoriose (a trisaccharide, three glucose residues linked by 1:4a bonds), and alpha limit dextrins (Polymers of glucose containing 8 glucose molecules with 1-6 a linkages).o Both salivary1 and pancreatic amylases are activated by Cl-Qo Further digestion of starch derivatives occurs by the enzymes (oligosaccharidases) present in the brush border of small intestinal epithelial cells. Maltase (a-glucosidase) breaks 1:4 linkages in maltose and maltotriose and releases glucose (two molecules of glucose from maltose and three molecules of glucose from maltotriose). Isomaltase (a- limit dextrinase) breaks 1:6 a linkages of alpha-limit dextrin and releases glucose. Isomaltase (a-limit dextrinase) is the only enzyme that attacks 1: 6a linkage.o Sucrose is hydrolysed into fructose and glucose by sucrase (an enzyme present in brush border of intestinal epithelium). Lactose is hydrolysed into galactose and glucose by lactase (b-glucosidase). Trehalase hydrolyzes trehelose (a 1:1 a - linked dimer of glucose) into two glucose molecules. Trehalose is found in mushrooms.About other optionso Pepsin and trypsin are invloved in protein metabolism.o Lipase is involved in fat metabolism.",B

Resting membrane potential is mainly due to -,Na+,K+,Cl-,Mg++,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., K+ Genesis of RMPo The cell membrane is selectively permeable. Due to presence of potassium leak channels K+ ions are freely permeable but permeability of Na+ is much less . In the generation of RMP, following sequence of events occur :-i) K+ diffuses out of cell along its concentration gradient (K+ concentration is very high inside the cells and very low in ECF).ii) The diffusion of K+ produces an intracellular negativity (due to non-diffusible protein anion in the cells) which is not nullified by the diffusion of Na+ in the opposite direction (membrane is impermeable to Na+) or diffusion of Cl- in same direction (Cl- concentration is already very high in ECF in comparison to ICF).iii) So, intracellular negativity is produced which opposes outward diffusion of K+ and when the equilibrium is reached, the inward force on K+ due to electrical gradient balances outward force on K+ due to concentation gradient.iv) Finally, at equilibrium inner side of cell is negatively charged with respect to outer side, and resting membrane potential is produced.o So, the RMP is principally due to concentration difference (chemical difference) of K+ in ECF and ICF. In neurons, the resting membrane potential is usually about -70 mV, which is close to the equilibrium potential for K+. Here, it is worth noting that RMP is close to the equilibrium potential of K+ but the value of RMP is exactly same as equilibrium potential of Cl-. It is because other ions also diffuse through membrane, though their effect is very little.",B

Heparin inhibits the active form of the following factors except: September 2009,V,X,XI,XII,"Ans. A: V Antic lo tting mechanisms: Antithrombin III is a circulating protease inhibitor that binds to the serine proteases in the coagulation system, blocking their activity as clotting factors. This binding is facilitated by heparin, a naturally occurring anticoagulant that is a mixture of sulfated polysaccharides with molecular weights averaging 15,000-18,000. The clotting factors that are inhibited are the active forms of factors IX, X, XI, and XII. The endothelium of the blood vessels also plays an active role in preventing the extension of clots into blood vessels. All endothelial cells except those in the cerebral microcirculation produce thrombomodulin, a thrombin-binding protein. In the circulating blood, thrombin is a procoagulant that activates factors V and VIII, but when it binds to thrombomodulin, it becomes an anticoagulant in that the thrombomodulin-thrombin complex activates protein C . Activated protein C (APC), along with its cofactor protein S, inactivates factors V and VIII and inactivates an inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator, increasing the formation of plasmin",A

And similarly promoter induction would increase the transcription rateQ.Capping, tailing, termination and splicing are not associated with promoter and so are not a consequence of promoter mutations. However, capping & tailing defects can result in m RNA with decreased stability and splicing defects in mRNA in which to few or too many introns have been removed.",A

Major metabolism of saturated fatty acids in the mitochondria is called as -,b-oxidation,a-oxidation,o-oxidation,None of the above,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., b-oxidation o b-oxidation is the principal pathway for catabalism of saturated fatty acids. b-oxidation mainly occurs in mitochondrial matrix (whereas fatty acid synthesis occurs in cytosol).o b-oxidatioon consists of repeated cycles of a series of reactions. With each cycle a two carbon unit (i.e. acetyl CoA molecule) is removed, started at the carboxyl end. Thus complete oxidation of the 16-Carbon fatty acid (e.g. palmitic acid) requires seven such cycles and generates eight molecules of acetyl CoA. In first 6 cycle, 6 acetyl CoA molecules (total 12 carbons) are removed leaving 4- carbon molecules for the last (7th) cycle. In 7th cycle, this 4 carbon molecules is cleaved into 2 acetyl CoA, making the total number of acetyl CoA molecules to eighto It is called b-oxidation because oxidation of fatty acids occurs at the b-carbon atom (3rd carbon and cleavage occurs between 2nd carbon (a-carbon) and 3rd carbon (b-carbon).o The pathway occurs in three stages: (i) Activation of fatty acid in the cytosol; (ii) Transport of activated fatty acid into mitochondria; and (iii) Standard b-oxidation process in mitochondrial matrix.",A

Stool examination revealed numerous pus cells and red blood cells. The patient's symptoms are associated with an epidemic of contaminated water and food. The characteristic feature of the organism responsible for the patient's symptoms includes which of the following?,It produces a toxin which inhibits protein synthesis,Gram positive bacilli,Invasion of liver may result in anchovy sauce like hepatic abscess formation,Causes osteomyelitis in sickle cell patients,"The etiologic agent is Shigella species, which is responsible for invasion of colonic mucosa and causes subsequent death and necrosis. Toxins produced by Shigella inhibit protein synthesis by mucosal epithelial cells. Affected patients are feverish and complain of lower abdominal pain along with severe bloody diarrhea. Nausea and vomiting is uncommon. Stool examination gives clues to the invasive nature of the organisms (presence of many pus cells and red blood cells). There is also an association to epidemics of contaminated food and drinks. Ref: Ray C.G., Ryan K.J. (2010). Chapter 33. Enterobacteriaceae. In C.G. Ray, K.J.

Diagnostic test for Enteric Fever is: September 2005,VDRL,Widal test,Urine culture,Gram's staining,"Ans. B: Widal test S. typhi is Gram negative, non acid fast, non capsulated and non-sporing bacilli, which measure approximately 2-4 mm x 0.6 mm. The organism is motile. Typhoid bacilli grow rapidly on ordinary media and optimum temperature of growth is 37degC. Blood culture The organisms can be best isolated during the first 7-10 days of the illness, but in at least half the cases the organisms can still be isolated in the second and the third weeks. Periodic subcultures are made after day 2, 5 and 7 on MacConkey agar. No growth after seven days may be regarded as negative. A positive blood culture is diagnostic, while the same significance cannot be attached to isolation from feces or urine. Cultural characters The growth on MacConkey agar/ DCA is pale yellow (non lactose fermenting) colonies, 2-3 mm in diameter, moist, circular and smooth convex surface. These are catalase positive and oxidase negative. The biochemical reactions which differentiate S. typhi from other genera are: Glucose fermentation + Mannitol fermentation + Lactose fermentation ? Sucrose fermentation - H2S production - Phenylalanine deaminase ?

"A 23-year-old man is admitted to the emergency department with a deep, bleeding stab wound of the pelvis. After the bleeding has been arrested, an MRI examination gives evidence that the right ventral primary ramus of L4 has been transected. Which of the following problems will most likely be seen during physical examination?",Reduction or loss of sensation from the me dial aspect of the leg,Loss of the Achilles tendon reflex,Weakness of abduction of the thigh at the hip joint,Inability to evert the foot,"The ventral ramus of L4 contains both sensory and motor nerve fibers. Injury from a stab wound could result in loss of sensation from the dermatome supplied by this segment. A dermatome is an area of skin supplied by a single spinal nerve; L4 dermatome supplies the medial aspect of the leg and foot. Loss of the Achilles tendon reflex relates primarily to an S1 deficit. The Achilles tendon reflex is elicited by tapping the calcaneus tendon, which results in plantar flexion. The obturator internus and gluteus medius and minimus are responsible for abduction of the thigh and are innervated by nerves L4, L5, and S1 (with L5 usually dominant). Nerves L5, S1, and S2 are responsible for eversion of the foot (S1 dominant).",A
Which of the following test is the best diagnosis in a patient with typhoid?,Blood culture,Widal,Stool culture,Urine culture,"Other than a positive blood culture, no specific laboratory test is diagnostic for enteric fever.

Subhepatic cecum is due to failure of the descent of the cecal bud and results in the absence of an ascending colon. Duplication of the intestine would not cause volvulus because there would still be a fixed mesentery and no free movement of the intestines. Congenital megacolon is due to faulty migration of neural crest cells into the wall of the colon, which causes a lack of parasympathetic postganglionic neurons.",C

Largest trematode infecting man is: March 2013,F. hepatica,F. buski,E. granulosus,Clonorchosis sinensis,"Ans. B i.e. F. buski Fasciolopsis buski It is commonly called the giant intestinal fluke, because it is an exceptionally large parasitic fluke, and the largest known to parasitise humans. Its size is variable and a mature specimen might be as little as 2 cm long, but the body may grow to a length of 7.5 cm and a width of 2.5 cm. It is a common parasite of humans and pigs and is most prevalent in Southern and Southeaster n Asia. It is a member of the family Fasciolidae in the order Echinostomida. The Echinostomida are members of the class Trematoda, the flukes. The fluke differs from most species that parasitise large mammals, in that they inhabit the gut rather than the liver as Fasciola species do. Fasciolopsis buski generally occupies the upper region of the small intestine, but in heavy infestations can also be found in the stomach and lower regions of the intestine. Fasciolopsis buski is the cause of the pathological condition fasciolopsiasis.",B

However, the two differ in that Candida is a human commensal and cannot be excluded by construction practices and environmental air monitoring. On the other hand, aspergilli are ubiquitous in the environment. There are instances of multiple infections in new units that have not been monitored prior to opening or in units adjacent to construction projects. Strict precautions should be taken to exclude dust and debris from the BMTU area during construction, but in any event, the environment should be monitored for airborne microorganisms, especially Aspergillus, prior to opening the unit. Zygomycetes may also be present in the air but are a less frequent cause of opportunistic infection in the BMT patient. While Penicillium organisms are also frequent in air, the species associated with opportunistic infection, P. marneffei, is endemic in Southeast Asia where it causes disease in the AIDS patient.

Which of the following is true regarding total heat production during a muscle contraction?,Activation heat is produced when a muscle is contracting,Initial heat produced is the due of basal metabolic processes,Relaxation heat is present in both isotonic and isometric contractions,Recovery heat of muscle is greater than the initial heat,"Activation heat is the heat that muscle produces whenever it contracts. Heat Production in Muscle Resting Heat: The heat given off at rest due to the basal metabolic processes . Initial Heat: The heat produced in excess of resting heat during contraction. It is made up of two subtypes: Activation Heat: The heat that muscle produces whenever it is contracting, and Shoening Heat: The heat which is propoional in amount to the distance the muscle shoens. Shoening heat is apparently due to some change in the structure of the muscle during shoening. Recovery Heat: This is the heat liberated by the metabolic proccesses that restore the muscle to its precontraction state. The recovery heat of muscle is approximately equal to the initial heat. Relaxation Heat: Heat released in a muscle that has contracted isotonically to restore it to its previous length. This extra heat is in addition to recovery heat.

Mean pulmonary aery pressure is: September 2007,10 mm Hg,15 mm Hg,20 mm Hg,25 mm Hg,"Ans. B:15 mm HgPulmonary aerial pressure is generated by the right ventricle ejecting blood into the pulmonary circulation, which acts as a resistance to the output from the right ventricle. With each ejection of blood during ventricular systole, the pulmonary aery blood volume increases, which stretches the wall of the aery. As the hea relaxes (ventricular diastole), blood continues to flow from the pulmonary aery into the pulmonary circulation. The smaller aeries and aerioles serve as the chief resistance vessels, and through changes in their diameter, regulate pulmonary vascular resistance. In hemodynamic terms, the mean pulmonary aerial pressure (PAP) can be described byPAP = (CO x PVR) + PVPWhere CO = cardiac output, PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance, and PVP = pulmonary venous pressure.The PVP is essentially the same as left atrial pressure. Therefore, increases in CO, PVR or PVP will lead to increases in PAP. Normally, mean pulmonary aery pressure is about 15 mmHg, and the pulmonary aery systolic and diastolic pressures about 25 and 10 mmHg, respectively. Pulmonary venous pressure is about 8 mmHg. Therefore, the pressure gradient driving flow through the pulmonary circulation is rather small at about 7 mmHg (mean pulmonary aerial minus venous pressures).",B

"A 45 years old male patient complaints of double vision when walking upstairs. His past history is significant for Type-ll diabetes, well controlled with glyburide. The nerve most probably involved is",Abducent nerve,Oculomotor nerve,Trochlear nerve,Trigeminal nerve,"Answer: (a) Abducent nerve.* Patient is having an injury to the abducent nerve (CN VI).* It innervates the lateral rectus muscle. Lateral rectus muscle moves the eyeball laterally (outwards). Therefore, a lesion of the abducent nerve results in internal strabismus (medial deviation) and diplopia (double vision).* The innervation of extraocular muscles can be remembered by a simple mnemonic, S04, LR6, 03. Superior oblique is innervated by 4th cranial nerve (trochlear), Lateral rectus by 6th cranial nerve (abducent), and others by 3rd cranial nerve (oculomotor).* The other muscles are superior, inferior and medial recti, and inferior oblique muscles.* The oculomotor nerve also supplies to levator palpabrae and carries parasympathetic fibers.* In abducent nerve lesion, the eye cannot look outwards due to paralysis of the lateral rectus.* The eye is turned inwards when trying to look straight ahead, due to the unopposed action of the medial, superior and inferior recti muscles supplied by the oculomotor nerve.",A
Ketosis is caused by -,Excessine utilization of glucose,Over production of acetyl-CoA,Excessine secretion of insulin,Excessine intake of carbohydrates,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Over production of acetyl-CoA o Ketogenesis occurs when there is high rate of fatty acid oxidation in liver which provides excessine acetyl-CoA.o Normally, rates of ketone body synthesis and their utilization (oxidation) are balanced so that their serum concentration is maintained to very low level (normal is < 0.2 mmol/L or< 1 mg/d1) and urinary excretion is negligible (< 1 mg/ 24 hours).o However, when rate of ketogenesis exceeds their utilization, their concentration in blood rises, and the condition is known as ketonemia (hyperketonemia).o Excess ketone bodies are eliminated in urine, this is known as kenonuria.o The overall condition is called Ketosis.o Ketogenesis is usually associated with excessive fatty acid oxidation^ which occurs most notably in starvation and diabetes (type 1 DM).",B

A pruritic papule develops 1-7 days after entry of the organisms or spores through a scratch. Initially it resembles an insect bite. The papule rapidly changes into a vesicle or small ring of vesicles that coalesce, and a necrotic ulcer develops. The lesions typically are 1-3 cm in diameter and have a characteristic central black eschar. Marked edema occurs. Lymphangitis and lymphadenopathy and systemic signs and symptoms of fever, malaise, and headache may occur. After 7-10 days the eschar is fullydeveloped. Eventually it dries, loosens, and separates; healing is by granulation and leaves a scar. It may take many weeks for the lesion to heal and the edema to subside.

Contraction of muscle can be caused by -,Release of noradrenaline,Release of acetylcholine,Release of serotonin,Release of histamine,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Release of acetylcholine o The process by which excitation (depolarization) of muscle fiber initiates its contraction is known as excitation contraction coupling.o The skeletal muscle fiber is innervated by A-a motor neuron.o When A-a motor neuron is stimulated, it carries the impulse (action potential) to neuromuscular junction where release of acetylcholineQ from presynaptic vesicle occurs. Acetylcholine binds to specific receptors (NmnicotinicQ) on motor-end plate (post-synaptic membrane).o This results in production of end-plate potential. If end-plate potential depolarizes the motor-end plate to firing (threshold) level, action potential is produced.o Once the Ca2+ concentration outside the reticulum has been lowered sufficiently, chemical interaction between myosin and actin ceases and the muscle relaxes,o This is due to reuptake of Ca2+ by sarcoplasmic reticulum,o Thus during relaxation :- Cytoplasmic concentration of Ca^ decreases.Sarcoplasmic reticulum concentration of Ca'2 increases.About option 'a'o Ca2+(ion) does not move out of cytoplasm (i.e. extracellular). Ca'2is taken up by sarcoplasmic reticulum.Mechanism of muscle contractiono The Ca+2 released from the terminal cisterns bind with troponin C and this triggers further steps in muscle contraction(AI 08) Ca+2- Troponin - C complex induces changes in troponin I and Troponin-T, which in turn brings about a lateral shift of tropomyosin awray from active sites of actin. As a result, the binding sites (active sites) on the actin filament are exposed.o ATP binds to myosin and myosin splits this ATP into ADP due to its ATPase activity. The energy released activates the myosin and the activated myosin head binds to active sites of actin filament, i.e.. Cross-bridging of myosin with actin. This cross-bridging immediately produces bending (flexion) of myosin head from 90deg to 45deg. Bending of myosin head produces 'power stroke' that causes sliding of actin on myosin and muscle contraction,o As the myosin head flexes to 45,:' (during power stroke), the ADP present on it is cast off making way for a fresh molecule of ATP. When fresh ATP binds to myosin ATPase, the myosin head detaches from actin and the cross-bridge repeats all over-again till the contraction is complete - So, this is called cross-bridge cycle.o During contraction: -Z lines come closerQ thereby shortenining sarcomereH-band disappearsQ.Width of I band decreasesQ.Width of A band is unchaged.Discharge in motor neuron|Release of acetylcholine at NM junction from presynaptic vesicles|Binding of acetylcholine to nicotinic Ach receptors|Opening of Na+ channels in Motor end plate|Generation of end plate potential|Generation of action potential or sarcolemma adjacent to NM junction|Spread of AP muscle fibers in both direction|Inward spread of depolarization along T-tubules|Interaction of dihydropyridien receptor and Ryanodine receptor|Release of Ca+2 ions from terminal cisterns of sarcoplasmic reticulum through Ryanodine receptor channels|Increased cytoplasmic (sarcoplasmic) Ca+2 concentration|Binding of Troponic C and Ca++|Lateral movement of tropomyosin with uncovering of active sites of actin|Cross-linkage of myosin with actin and muscle contractionMechanism of relaxationo Relaxation is due to removal of calcium ions from sarcoplasm into terminal cisterns by active transport (Ca+2 ATPase).

Epigenetics is-,Alteration in nucleotide sequence,Alteration in chromosome number,Alteration in gene expression,Alteration in chromosome size,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Alteration in gene expression* Epigenetics is a heritable change in the level of gene expression, not caused by changes in DNA sequence.* It includes changes like Histone modification or DNA methylation# Covalent modifications of either DNA (e.g. cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation) or of histone proteins (e.g. lysine acetylation, lysine and arginine methylation, serine and threonine phosphorylation, and lysine ubiquitination and sumoylation) play central roles in many types of epigenetic inheritance.* Histone acetylation is found to cause uncondensation of chromsosomes. Uncondensed chromosomes are more prone to get expressed. Hence Histone acetylation is found to increase the level of gene expression* Methylation of Cytidine of CG islands is found to cause condensation of chromosomes. This in turn decreases the level of gene expression* Epigenetic alterations are preserved during cell division. It is also propogated to progeny by a process called as transgenerational epigenetic inheritance* Thus epigenetics is a heritable change in the levels of gene expression not mediated by changes in DNA or gene sequence.",C

Which of the following is the first immunoglobulin to appear following infection?,IgG,IgM,IgA,IgE,"IgM is the first immunoglobulin to appear after exposure to an antigen. They are relatively sho lived hence their demonstration in the serum indicates recent infection. Normal level of IgM is 1.2mg/ml. It is also the earliest to be synthesized by fetus beginning by about 20 weeks of age. As it cannot cross the placental barrier its presence in fetus or newborn indicates intrauterine infection. Its detection is therefore useful for diagnosis of congenital infections such as syphilis, rubella, HIV and toxoplasma. IgG is the major immunoglobulin in human serum. It is the only class of immunoglobulins which can cross the placenta. It binds to organisms and enhances their phagocytosis.

The autonomic innervation modulates the rate of depolarization of the sinoatrial node, thereby modulating the hea rate. The sinoatrial node is composed of specialized cardiac muscle cells that depolarize spontaneously at a greater rate than that of other cardiac muscle cells. Because cardiac muscle cells contact each other electrically through gap junctions at the intercalated discs, the depolarization of the sinoatrial node drives the other cardiac muscle cells of the atrium to depolarize at the same rate as the node.",B

A 30 year old veterinarian visits her obstetrician for a first-trimester prenatal check-up. She has no complaints.Routine physical exam is significant only for mild cervical lymphadenopathy. She is prescribed spiramycin but is noncompliant. Her baby is born with hydrocephalus and cerebral calcifications. Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible?,Isospora belli,Leishmania donovani,Plasmodium vivax,Toxoplasma gondii,"Humans become infected with Toxoplasma gondii by ingesting cysts in contaminated food or through contact with cat feces. The veterinarian in question was therefore paicularly at risk of infection. T. gondii is especially hazardous in pregnant women because the organism can be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta. (It is pa of the ToRCHeS group of congenital infections;Toxoplasma, Rubella, CMV, Herpes/HIV, Syphilis). Since infected mothers are usually asymptomatic, cases often go unnoticed. Occasionally, patients present with cervical lymphadenopathy, as did the veterinarian, and require treatment to prevent complications in the fetus. Though newborns are also often asymptomatic, they are at risk for developing the classic triad of chorioretinitis (at bih or later in life), hydrocephalus, and cerebral calcifications. Note that T. gondii is also a common cause of CNS infections (e.g., encephalitis) in HIV-positive patients. Isospora belli (choice A) is an intestinal protozoan that causes watery diarrhea, paicularly in the immunocompromised. Fecal-oral transmission of oocysts allows invasion of small intestinal mucosa, destroying the brush border. Leishmania donovani (choice B) causes kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis), which is characterized by fever, weakness, weight loss, splenomegaly, and skin hyperpigmentation. It is prevalent in regions of the Mediterranean, Middle East, Russia, and China. The vector is the sandfly. Plasmodium vivax (choice C) causes malaria and is transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito, which introduces sporozoites into the blood. These differentiate into merozoites that destroy erythrocytes. Splenomegaly ensues. Other species of this organism also cause malaria: P. malariae and P. falciparum (which causes a more severe form of the disease). Note that sickle cell trait confers resistance to this disease.

Node of Ranvier is seen in,Cell body,Dendrites,Axons,Terminal butons,"A cross-section of a typical small nerve has many large nerve fibers that constitute most of the cross-sectional area. However, a more careful look revealsmany more small fibers lying between the large ones. The large fibers are myelinated, and the small ones are unmyelinated. The average nerve trunk contains about twice asmany unmyelinated fibers as myelinated fibers. The central core of the fiber is the axon, and the membrane of the axon is the membrane that actually conducts the action potential. The axon is filled in its center with axoplasm, which is a viscid intracellular fluid. Surrounding the axon is a myelin sheath that is often much thicker than the axon itself. About once every 1 to 3 millimeters along the length of the myelin sheath is a node of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is deposited around the axon by Schwann cells in the following manner: The membrane of a Schwann cell first envelops the axon. The Schwann cellthen rotates around the axon many times, laying down multiple layers of Schwann cell membrane containing the lipid substance sphingomyelin. This substance is an excellent electrical insulator that decreases ion flow through the membrane about 5000-fold. At the juncture between each two successive Schwann cells along the axon, a small uninsulated area only 2 to 3 micrometers in length remains where ions still can flow with ease through the axon membrane between the extracellular fluid and the intracellular fluid inside the axon. This area is called the node of Ranvier.Ref: Guyton and Hall textbook medical physiology, 13th edition.",C

Which of the following is not a potential aetiology of peripheral cyanosis?,Cold exposure,Deep venous thrombosis,Methemoglobinemia,Peripheral vascular disease,"In the evaluation of cyanosis, the first step is to differentiate central from peripheral cyanosis. In central cyanosis, because the etiology is either reduced oxygen saturation or abnormal hemoglobin, the physical findings include bluish discoloration of both mucous membranes and skin.In contrast, peripheral cyanosis is associated with normal oxygen saturation but slowing of blood flow and an increased fraction of oxygen extraction from blood; subsequently, the physical findings are present only in the skin and extremities. Mucous membranes are spared.Peripheral cyanosis is commonly caused by cold exposure with vasoconstriction in the digits.Similar physiology is found in Raynaud's phenomenon. Peripheral vascular disease and deep venous thrombosis result in slowed blood flow and increased oxygen extraction with subsequent cyanosis. Methemoglobinemia causes abnormal haemoglobin that circulates systemically. Consequently, the cyanosis associated with this disorder is systemic.Other common causes of central cyanosis include severe lung disease with hypoxemia, right-to-left intracardiac shunting, and pulmonary aeriovenous malformations.",C

A drop in ECF volume or intra-aerial vascular volume leads to a reflex increase in renal nerve discharge and decreases renal aerial pressure. Both changes increase renin secretion, and the angiotensin II formed by the action of renin increases the rate of secretion of aldosterone. The aldo- sterone causes Na+ and, secondarily, water retention, expanding ECF volume, and shutting off the stimulus that initiated increased renin secretion.renin causes renal vasoconstriction with decreased glomerular filtration and renal blood flow.

Part of colon with no mesentery-,Transverse colon,Sigmoid colon,Ascending colon,Rectum,"Ans. C. Ascending colona. The large intestine develops as a fully mesenteric organ. However, after the rotation of the gut tube in utero, large portions of it come to lie adherent to the retroperitoneum, which means that some parts of the colon are fixed within the retroperitoneum, and other parts are suspended by a mesentery within the peritoneal cavity. Those portions of the colon within the retroperitoneum are separated from other retroperitoneal structures by a thin layer of connective tissue which forms an avascular field during surgical dissection, but which offers little or no barrier to the spread of disease within the retroperitoneum.b. The caecum may be within the retroperitoneum, but more frequently is suspended by a short mesentery. The ascending colon is usually a retroperitoneal structure although the hepatic flexure may be suspended by a mesentery. The transverse colon emerges from the retroperitoneum on a rapidly elongating mesentery and lies, often freely mobile, in the upper abdomen.c. The transverse mesocolon shortens to the left of the upper abdomen and may become retroperitoneal at the splenic flexure. Occasionally the splenic flexure is suspended by a short mesentery. The descending colon is retroperitoneal usually to the level of the left iliac crest.d. As the colon enters the pelvis it becomes increasingly more mesenteric again at the origin of the sigmoid colon, although the overall length of the sigmoid mesentery is highly variable. The distal sigmoid colon lies on a rapidly shortening mesentery as it approaches the pelvis; by the level of the rectosigmoid junction the mesentery has all but disappeared, so that the rectum enters the pelvis as a retroperitoneal structure. The caecum and proximal ascending colon are often more mobile on a longer mesentery in the neonate and infant than they are in the adult.e. The mesorectum is enclosed by meso rectal fascia, a distinct covering derived from the visceral peritoneum that is also called the visceral fascia of the mesorectum, fascia propria of the rectum or the presacral wing of the hypogastric sheath. The fascia bounds the mesorectum posteriorly and thus lies anterior to the retro rectal space and the pre-sacral fascia. The meso rectal fascia is surrounded by a very thin layer of loose areolar tissue which separates it from the posterior and lateral walls of the true pelvis. Superiorly, the meso rectal fascia blends with the connective tissue bounding the sigmoid mesentery. Laterally, it extends around the rectum and mesorectum and becomes continuous with a denser condensation of fascia anteriorly. In males this anterior fascia is known as the rectovesical fascia of Denon Villiers, and in females it forms the fascia of the rectovaginal septum.",C

Allosteric inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase,AMP,Acetyl CoA,ADP,Citrate,"In the complete degradation of pyruvate, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and the citric acid cycle perform the oxidation of all substrate carbon to CO2. The hydrogen is retained in reduced form; it is subsequently oxidized in the respiratory chain Pyruvate is produced by glycolysis in the cytosol, while PDH and all subsequent degradative steps are located in the mitochondria. Therefore, pyruvate needs to be transpoed from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix. The outer mitochondrial membrane contains porins, which are membrane proteins that form non-specific pores and allow free permeation of most small metabolites, including pyruvate. In contrast, the inner mitochondrial membrane is much more restrictive, and it is permeable to only those metabolites for which it contains specific carrier systems. The pyruvate carrier is an active transpoer that co-transpos pyruvate and a proton. Red blood cells and blood platelets lack mitochondria and accordingly cannot degrade pyruvate. These cells reduce pyruvate to lactate, which they then release into the bloodstream",B

Carbamoyl phosphate synthase - 1 acts in -,Purine synthesis,Pyrimidine synthesis,Urea cycle,TCA cycle,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Urea cycle o Biosynthesis of urea occurs in five steps.Carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I (CPS-I), a mitochondrial enzyme, catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl phosphate by condensation of CO, and ammonia. Two molecules of ATP are required for the reaction. CPS- I is the rate limiting enzyme of urea cycle, It is an allosteric enzyme and allosterically activated by N- acetyl glutamate.o There is one cytosolic carbamyl phosphate synthase-II (CPS-II) which uses glutamine rather than ammonia as the nitrogen donor and functions in pyrimidine synthesis.Ornithine transcarbamoylase catalyzes the formation of citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine.Arginosuccinate synthase catalyzes the formation of arginosuccinate from citrulline and aspartate. This reaction requires I ATP, but 2 high energy phosphate bonds are consumed as ATP is converted to AMP + PPi. The amino group of aspartate provides one of the two nitrogen atoms that appear in urea (The other one is provided by ammonia NH4).Arginosuccinate lyase (arginosuccinase) catalyses the cleavage of arginosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. Fumarate enters in TCA cycle.Arginase catalyses the formation of urea from arginine by hydrolytic cleavage of arginine to yield urea and ornithine. Ornithine is thus regenerated and can enter mitochondria to initiate another round of the urea cycle.",C

True statement about calcium :,Absorbed in upper small intestine,Absorbed in lower small intestine,Absorption increased by alkaline pH,All,"A i.e. Absorbed in upper small intestineThe body of young adult contains - 1100gm (27.5mol) of Ca; 90% of it is in skeleton. The plasma calcium, is normally about 10gm/dL (5meq/ L, 2.5 mmol / L)Q, of which 50% is ionized. The remainder is bound ionically to negative charged proteins (predominantly albumin & immunoglobins) or loosly complexed with phosphate, citrate, sulphate. It is the free ionizedcalcium, that is a vital second messengerQ and necessary for blood coagulation, nerve conduction and muscle contractionQ.The level of plasma calcium at which fatal tetany occurs is still above the level at which clotting defect would occur.Since the extent of calcium binding by plasma protein is propoionate to the plasma protein level, it is impoant to know the plasma protein level when evaluating the total plasma calcium. An algorithm to correct for protein changes adjusts the totalserum calcium (in mg / dL) upward by 0.8 times the defecit in serum albumin (in gm/dl) or by 0.5 times the defect in serum immunoglobin (in g/dl). So corrected calcium concentration= Total calcium level (mg/dL) + 0.8 mg/dL (0.2MM) for every decrement in serum albumin of 1.0 gm/dL (below the reference value of 4.1 gm/dL of albumin).= Total calcium level (mg/dL) + 0.5 mg/dL for every decrement in serum immunoglobulin of 1gm/dL.PH affects the calcium level, for example tetany appear at much higher total Ca++ levels, if patient hyperventilates, increasing plasma pH. Plasma proteins are more ionized when the pH is high, providing more protein anion to bind with calcium thus reducing effective amount of ionized calcium. In same way acidosis increases ionized Ca++ levelsQ.Intestinal absorption of calcium involves both active (transcellular) and passive (pa racellular) mechanism. Passive absorption is nonsaturable & approximates 5% of intake, whereas active mechanism controlled by 1, 25, (OH)2 D, normally ranges from 20- 70%. Active absorption occurs mainly in proximal small bowel (duodenum & proximal jejunum)Q. Optical rates of Ca** absorption requires gastric acidQ. This is especially true for weakly dissociable calcium supplements as Ca CO3.Calcium interchange between plasma and rapidly exchangeable reservoir of bone is 500mmol per day.

False about pseudomyxoma peritonei,Recurrence after surgery,Refractory to drugs,Hypehermia intra peritoneal chemotherapy is the treatment option,Most commonly associated with the appendiceal tumor,"Pseudomyxoma peritonei. Pseudomyxoma peritonei describes mucinous ascites arising from a ruptured ovarian or appendiceal adenocarcinoma. In this disease, the peritoneum becomes coated with a mucus-secreting tumor that fills the peritoneal cavity with tenacious semisolid mucus and large, loculated cystic massesThe current treatment of patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei involves resection of as much of the tumor as possible(cytoreduction) and intraperitoneal heated chemotherapy (IPHC). Operative management includes omentectomy, stripping of involved peritoneum, resection of involved organs, and appendectomy, if not previously performed. There should be no residual tumor nodules larger than 2 mm in diameter after resection to facilitate penetration of the chemotherapy into any residual disease. IPHC can be per- formed by an open technique, in which the abdomen is left open to ensure adequate chemotherapy distribution throughout the peritoneal cavity, or a closed technique, in which the abdomen is closed after inflow and outflow cannulas are placed. The latter allows easier maintenance of hypehermia Ref: Sabiston 20th edition Pgno: 1080",B

"Peussis toxin acts by all of the following mechanisms, EXCEPT:",ADP ribosylation of proteins associated with receptors,Increase cyclic AMP,Increased calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum,Acts through G alpha subunit,"Peussis toxin is the major virulence factor of B.peussis. It is an A-B toxin produced from a single operon as an enzymatic subunit & 5 binding subunits that are assembled into the complete toxin on the bacterial surface. B subunit binds to the target cells whereas A subunit acts on the target. The binding subunits mediate attachment of the toxin to the carbohydrate moieties on the host cell surface. The enzymatic subunit is then internalised & ADP- ribosylates a G protein that affects adenylate Cyclase activity. Unlike cholera toxin, which in essence keep cyclase activity turned on peussis toxin freezes the opposite side of the regulatory circuit & cripples the capacity of the host cell to inactivate cyclase activity. Multiple Intracellular signalling pathways are disrupted by this G protein modification. Among the results of this action are lymphocytosis, insulinemia & histamine sensitisation.

Michaelis-Menten hypothesis states that,Rate of enzymatic reaction is independent of substrate concentration,Rate of non enzymatic reaction is propoional to substrate concentration,Km is the enzyme-substrate complex association constant,Enzyme -substrate complex formation is essential in enzymatic reaction,"Michaelis and Menten have proposed a hypothesis for enzyme action, which is most acceptable. According to their hypothesis, the enzyme molecule (E) first combines with a substrate molecule (S) to form an enzyme-substrate (ES) complex which fuher dissociates to form product (P) and enzyme (E) back. Enzyme once dissociated from the complex is free to combine with another molecule of substrate and form product in a similar way. The ES complex is an intermediate or transient complex and the bonds involved are weak non-covalent bonds, such as H-bonds, Van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions. Sometimes two substrates can bind to an enzyme molecule and such reactions are called as bisubstrate reactions. The site to which a substrate can bind to the enzyme molecule is extremely specific and is called as active site or catalytic site. Normally the molecular size and shape of the substrate molecule is extremely small compared to that of an enzyme molecule. The active site is made up of several amino acid residues that come together as a result of foldings of secondary and teiary structures of the enzyme. So, the active site possesses a complex three-dimensional form and shape, provides a predominantly non-polar cleft or crevice to accept and bind the substrate. Few groups of active site amino acids are bound to substrate while few groups bring about change in the substrate molecule.Ref: Textbook of medical biochemistry, MN Chatterji, 8th edition, page no: 124",C

JSB stain is used for both thick and thin smears, and is the standard method used by laboratories under the National Malaria Eradication Programme in India.",A
Rate limiting step in cholesterol synthesis is,HMG CoA synthetase,HMG CoA reductase,Thiokinase,Mevalonate kinase,"Control of Cholesterol BiosynthesisSREBP Pathway The steps in the biosynthesis of cholesterol to HMG-CoA are reversible. The formation of mevalonate, however, in the next step is irreversible and is the committed step. Regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis is exeed near the beginning of the pathway at the HMG-CoA reductase step, the rate limiting step. The reduced synthesis of cholesterol in starving animals is accompanied by a decrease in the activity of the enzyme. However, it is only hepatic synthesis that is inhibted by dietary cholesterol. 'HMG-CoA reductase' in liver is inhibited by mevalonate, the immediate product of the pathway and by cholesterol, the main product.SREBP: Cholesterol and metabolites repress transcription of the 'HMG-CoA reductase' activation of a 'sterol regulatory element-binding protein' (SREBP) transcription factor. SREBPs are a family of proteins that regulate the transcription of a range of genes involved in the cellular uptake and metabolism of cholesterol and other lipids.A second control point appears to be at the cyclisation of squalene and conversion to lanosterol, but details of the regulation at this step is not clear.Effect of starving/fasting: Fasting and/starvation also inhibit the enzyme and activate 'HMG-CoA lyase' to form ketone bodies.Effect of feeding cholesterol: Feeding cholesterol reduces the hepatic biosynthesis of cholesterol by reducing the activity of 'HMG-CoA reductase'. Intestinal cholesterol biosynthesis does not respond to the feeding of high cholesterol diets.Role of hormonesInsulin: Increases HMG-CoA reductase activity. The hormone is required for the diurnal rhythm (diurnal variation) that occurs in cholesterol biosynthesis, a phenomenon probably related to feeding cycles and the need for bile acid synthesis.Glucagon and/glucocoicoids Decreases the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and reduce the cholesterol biosynthesis.Thyroid hormones: Stimulates HMG-CoA reductase activity.Role of cyclic AMP: HMG-CoA reductase may exist in active/inactive forms, which is reversibly modified by phosphorylation/and dephosphorylation mechanisms, which may be mediated by c-AMP dependent protein kinases. Cyclic AMP inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis by conveing 'HMG-CoA reductase' to inactive form.Ref: M.N. Chatterjea - Textbook of Biochemistry, 8th edition, page no: 434",B

Hormones required during puberty -,LSH,Testesterone,Leptin,All of the above,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., All of the above o Puberty is triggered by a release of gonadotropins (FSH and LH) from pituitary gland,o These hormones act as signals to the gonads (testes/ovaries) that trigger the production of -Estrogen, progesterone and some testosterone in women.Testosterone in men.o in both males and females, testosterone is responsible for development of pubic hair, accelerated bone growth, body odor and acne during puberty. For boys, testosterone is responsible for the process of virilization, including the enlargement of the penis, increased libido and growth of facial and chest hair,o Estrogen is the major hormone responsible for female puberal development. It causes development of breast and thickening of endometrium.o Progesterone causes proliferation of acini in mammary glands and converts watery cervical secretion to viscid and scanty.o Leptin facilitates release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). thereby helping in pubertal onset,o Other hormones which are involved in puberty are thyroxine and growth hormone.",D
Which is most lipogenic carbohydrate:,Glucose,Galactose,Fructose,Starch,"All carbohydrates (if in excess), gets conveed to fat in body (endogenous fat). Sucrose is made up of glucose and fructose. So, when sucrose is taken instead of glucose, it increases lipogenesis because: Fructose is most rapidly metabolised sugar It bypasses PFK-1 step (Rate Limiting Enzyme of glycolysis). So fructose forms acetyl CoA and thus fats. So fructose is regarded as most lipogenic sugar. Fructose | Uses the enzymes of Glycolysis | Finally forms Pyruvate | Acetyl CoA | Fats (TG, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol) Fructose is present in fruits, honey, table sugar.",C

3rd heart sound is d/t,Closure of av valve,Closure of aortic valve,Mid diastolic flow r in the ventricle,Atrial contraction,"Occasionally a weak, rumbling third heart sound is heard at the beginning of the middle third of diastole.
A logical but unproven explanation of this sound is an oscillation of blood back and forth between the walls of the ventricles initiated by inrushing blood from the atria.
The reason the third heart sound does not occur until the middle third of diastole is believed to be that in the early part of diastole, the ventricles are not filled sufficiently to create even the small amount of elastic tension necessary for reverberation.
The frequency of this sound is usually so low that the ear cannot hear it, yet it can often be recorded in the phonocardiogram.",C
Drug resistance is not transmitted by -,HFr,Transposons,Plasmid,Chromosomes,Factor: The F factor is a tramsfer factor that contains the genetic information necessary for the synthesis of sex pilus and for self-transfer but is devoid of other identifiable genetic markers such as drug resistance. Cells carrying the F factor have no distinguishing feature other than their ability to mate with F - cells and render them F+. The F factor is actually an episode and has the ability to exist in some cells in the integrated data or inseed into the host chromosome; such cells are able to transfer the chromosomal gene to recipient cells with high frequency and are known as Hfr cells. Following conjugation with an Hfr cell an F- only rarely becomes F+ though it receives chromosomal genes from the donors.

Myoglobin is a monomeric heme protein found mainly in muscle tissue where it serves as an intracellular storage site for oxygen. During periods of oxygen deprivation oxymyoglobin releases its bound oxygen which is then used for metabolic purposes. The teiary structure of myoglobin is that of a typical water soluble globular protein. Its secondary structure is unusual in that it contains a very high propoion (75%) of a-helical secondary structure. A myoglobin polypeptide is comprised of 8 separate right handed a-helices, designated A through H, that are connected by sho non helical regions. Amino acid R-groups packed into the interior of the molecule are predominantly hydrophobic in character while those exposed on the surface of the molecule are generally hydrophilic, thus making the molecule relatively water soluble.",D

Its onset occurs several weeks after a group A alpha hemolytic streptococcal infection, paicularly of the skin, and often occurs with infection due to nephritogenic types of streptococci. The complement level is typically low, suggesting an antigen-antibody reaction with consumption of complement. Lumpy deposits of immunoglobulin and complement component C3 are seen along glomerular basement membranes stained by immunofluorescence, suggesting antigen-antibody complexes. It is likely that streptococcal antigen-antibody complexes are filtered out by glomeruli, fix complement, and attract neutrophils.

The pre-depolarization phase of the SA node Action potential is due to,K+ entry,Ca++ entry,Na+ entry towards the end of repolarization,Cl- efflux,"Effect of Potassium and Calcium Ions on Hea Function In the discussion of membrane potentials in Chapter 5, it was pointed out that potassium ions have a marked effect on membrane potentials, and in Chapter 6 it was noted that calcium ions play an especially impoant role in acti- vating the muscle contractile process. Therefore, it is to be expected that the concentration of each of these two ions in the extracellular fluids should also have impoant effects on cardiac pumping. Effect of Potassium Ions. Excess potassium in the extracellular fluids causes the hea to become dilated and flaccid and also slows the hea rate. Large quantities also can block conduction of the cardiac impulse from the atria to the ventricles through the A-V bundle. Elevation of potassium concentration to only 8 to 12 mEq/L--two to three times the normal value--can cause such weakness of the hea and abnormal rhythm that death occurs. These effects result paially from the fact that a high potassium concentration in the extracellular flu- ids decreases the resting membrane potential in the car- diac muscle fibers, as explained in Chapter 5. That is, high extracellular fluid potassium concentration paially depo- larizes the cell membrane, causing the membrane potential to be less negative. As the membrane potential decreases, the intensity of the action potential also decreases, which makes contraction of the hea progressively weaker. Effect of Calcium Ions. An excess of calcium ions causes effects almost exactly opposite to those of potas- sium ions, causing the hea to go toward spastic con- traction. This is caused by a direct effect of calcium ions to initiate the cardiac contractile process, as explained earlier in the chapter. Conversely, deficiency of calcium ions causes car- diac flaccidity, similar to the effect of high potassium. Founately, calcium ion levels in the blood normally are regulated within a very narrow range. Therefore, cardiac effects of abnormal calcium concentrations are seldom of clinical concern.

Which of the following cofactors is required for decarboxylation of alpha-ketoacids?,Vitamin B1,Vitamin B2,Vitamin B3,Vitamin B5,"Vitamin B1, or thiamine, is the coenzyme required (as the pyrophosphate) for the decarboxylation of alpha-ketoacids. An example of this reaction is pyruvate decarboxylase reaction in alcoholic fermentation. Other reactions such as that catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase also rely on thiamine pyrophosphate for decarboxylation, but require other cofactors as well. Thiamine is also required for the generation of pentose phosphates for nucleotide synthesis in the pentose phosphate pathway (hexose monophosphate shunt), serving as a cofactor for transketolase. Vitamin B2, or riboflavin, is a constituent of FMN (flavin mononucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide). It functions in hydrogen and electron transpo. Vitamin B3, or niacin (nicotinic acid), is a coenzyme that is also involved in hydrogen and electron transpo. Nicotinic acid functions in the form of NAD and NADP. Vitamin B5, or pantothenic acid, is conjugated with coenzyme A to act as a carboxylic acid carrier. Ref: Ender D.A. (2011). Chapter 44. Micronutrients: Vitamins & Minerals. In D.A. Bender, K.M.

Bioavailability of non-heme iron is low compared to heme iron as-,Presence of excess micronutrients,Presence of Phytates,Presence of acid,Presence of vitamin C,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Presence of phvtates Iron absorption o Iron is mainly absorbed in the duodenum. o There are two broad forms of diatary iron, and they are obsorbed differently - Absorption of haem iron Haem iron is the iron present as myoglobin, hemoglobin and related compounds from which the haem is released by proteolytic enzymes of gut, and haem then is converted to haem in. Haemin is taken up by mucosal enterocytes and iron is released from haemin intracellularly by haem oxygenase. Haem iron absorption is not much affected by other dietary constituents. Absorption of non-haem iron Non-haem iron is converted to ferrous form before its absorption. Gastric acid and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) helps in its absorption by keeping it in ferrous form. Uptake of non-haem iron is impaired by phytates and oxalates present in several plant foods, because of formation of complexes of iron with phytates and oxalates. Calcium facilitates iron absorption by competing with iron for forming complexes with phytates and oxalates. Tae also reduces iron absorption due to the formation of insoluble iron tannate complexes.",B

The rickettsia C. burnetii causes Q fever, and humans are usually infected by aerosol of a sporelike form shed in milk, urine, feces, or placenta of infected sheep, cattle, or goats. Lyme disease is caused by a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, and produces the characteristic lesion erythema chronicum migrans (ECM). The etiologic agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is R. rickettsia. It usually produces a rash that begins in the extremities and then involves the trunk. Two human forms of ehrlichiosis can occur: human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), caused by E. chaffeensis; and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE), caused by an as yet unnamed Ehrlichia. Ehrlichiosis was previously recognized only as a veterinary pathogen. HME infection is transmitted by the brown dog tick and A. americanum. HGE infection is transmitted by I. scapularis, the same tick that transmits Lyme disease. Both infections cause fever and leukopenia. A rash rarely occurs. E. chaffeensis infects monocytes, and HGE infects granulocytes; both organisms produce inclusion bodies called morulae. Francisella tularensis is a small, Gram-negative, nonmotile coccobacillus.

Production of bile takes place in:,The gall bladder,Kupffer cells,Hepatic duct,Hepatocytes,"PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMYÂ  OF BILIARY SECRETION
Bile is secreted in two stages by the liver:
1.Â  The initial portion is secreted by the principal functional cells of the liver, the hepatocytes; this initialÂ secretion contains large amounts of bile acids, cholesterol, and other organic constituents. It is secretedÂ into minute bile canaliculi that originate between the hepatic cells.
2.Â  Next,Â theÂ bileÂ flowsÂ inÂ theÂ canaliculiÂ towardÂ the interlobular septa, where the canaliculi empty intoÂ terminalÂ bileÂ ductsÂ andÂ thenÂ intoÂ progressively larger ducts, finally reaching the hepatic duct and common bile duct. From these ducts, the bile either empties directly into the duodenum or is diverted for minutes up to several hours through the cystic duct into the gallbladder. In its course through the bile ducts, a second portion ofÂ  liverÂ secretionÂ isÂ addedÂ toÂ theÂ initialÂ  bile.

Starvation and diabetes mellitus can lead on to ketoacidosis which of the following features is in our of ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus?,"Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose","Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose","Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose","Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose","Ketoacidosis is a high anion gap metabolic acidosis due to an excessive blood concentration of ketone bodies. Ketone bodies (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetone) are released into the blood from the liver when hepatic lipid metabolism has changed to a state of increased ketogenesis. The three major types of ketosis are: Starvation ketosis Alcoholic ketoacidosis Diabetic ketoacidosis Starvation Ketoacidosis: Occurs secondary to starvation, is due to a diminished insulin secretion, that leads to an increase in lipolysis and ketogenesis. The acidosis even with prolonged fasting is only mild to moderate. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a state of absolute or relative insulin deficiency and is defined by the American Diabetes Association's (ADA) diagnostic criteria of Hyperglycemia , Acidosis (aerial pH Ketosis (moderate ketonuria or ketonemia) The metabolic differences between diabetes and starvation include- Insulin levels: The level of insulin is decreased in both diabetes and starvation. It is more decreased in case of diabetes (viually absent in type I diabetes). There is relative excess of glucagon in both the cases. Glucagon acts through elevation in CAMP level. Blood glucose levels: Diabetics exhibit a characteristic hyperglycemia where as in starvation the individual maintain a blood glucose level that is near to normal Ketosis: The mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue and hepatic ketogencsis are greater in diabetes than in starvation. As a result the ketoacidosis observed in diabetes in much more severe than that observed during starvation.

"As pa of a research experiment, a person undergoes two fine needle muscle biopsies to obtain small amounts of tissue for biochemical analysis. The first is taken at the beginning of the experiment while the subject is at rest. The second is taken at the end of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on a stationary bicycle. The activity of the muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes is found to be much higher in the second measurement. Which of the following biochemical changes would be most likely to produce this effect?",Decreased ADP,Decreased intracellular Ca2+,Increased acetyl CoA,Increased pyruvate concentration,"In most biochemical pathways, only one to a few enzymatic reactions are under regulatory control. These often occur either at the beginning of pathways or at pathway branch points. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex controls the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, and decarboxylates pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) with production of NADH and acetyl CoA (the substrate for the citric acid cycle). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in mitochondria is huge, visible as dots by electron microscopy, because it is composed of many copies of at least 5 separate enzymes. Three of these (pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, and dihydrolipoate dehydrogenase) perform the actual biochemical reactions. The other two, PDH kinase and phosphatase, add or remove phosphate groups from the PDH complex, respectively. The more active form of PDH is not phosphorylated; the less active form is. In exercise, high ADP and pyruvate concentrations inhibit PDH kinase, while increased Ca2+ stimulates PDH phosphatase. Both effects produce more of the dephosphorylated, more active form of PDH. Impoant Points - A higher, not decreased, concentration of ADP is seen with exercise and tends to turn PDH on. Intracellular calcium is increased, not decreased, with exercise and tends to turn PDH on. Increased acetyl CoA, as seen in active lipolysis, tends to turn PDH off. Ref: Bender D.A., Mayes P.A.

Ganglion of hay fever is,Otic ganglion,Ptery gopalatine ganglion,Submandibular ganglion,Geniculate ganglion,"In hay fever, the allergen-reagin reaction occurs in the nose. Histamine released in response to the reaction causes local intranasal vascular dilation, with resultant increased capillary pressure and increased capillary permeability. Both these effects cause rapid fluid leakage into the nasal cavities and into associated deeper tissues of the nose, and the nasal linings become swollen and secretory. Pterygopalatine ganglion is also called as hay fever ganglion because it serves as a relay station for secretomotor fibres to the -lacrimal glands -mucous glands of nose -paranasal sinuses -palate -pharynx.

The D gene and J gene recombination event occurs first, followed by V recombination with the D-J region. The cytoplasmic mu chains are the result of immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement, the production of the messenger RNA from this rearrangement, and the ribosomal synthesis of the protein mu chain. This is the second event that occurs in the B-cell maturational sequence. Light chain rearrangement occurs when recombination events occur with the V gene and J gene from the light chain germline. After this recombination has occurred, and the messenger RNA for this germ line has produced the light chain protein, the light chains and heavy chains form.

APC gene is located on which chromosome,Chromosome 5,Chromosome 6,Chromosome 9,Chromosome 11,"Ref Robbins 9/e p296 APC is classified as a tumor suppressor gene. Tumor suppressor genes prevent the uncontrolled growth of cells that may result in cancerous tumors. The protein made by the APC gene plays a critical role in several cellular processes that determine whether a cell may develop into a tumor. The APC protein helps control how often a cell divides, how it attaches to other cells within a tissue, how the cell polarizes and the morphogenesis of the 3D structures, or whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the chromosome number in cells produced through cell division is correct. The APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are involved in cell attachment and signaling. The activity of one protein in paicular, beta-catenin, is controlled by the APC protein (see: Wnt signaling pathway). Regulation of beta-catenin prevents genes that stimulate cell division from being turned on too often and prevents cell overgrowth. The human APC gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 in band q22.2 (5q22.2). The APCgene has been shown to contain an internal ribosome entry site.

Mechanism of analgesia is by,Nocioeptin stimulation,Nooistatln stimulation,Nicotinic & cholinergic receptors,Anadumide receptors,"The degree to which a person reacts to pain varies tremendously. This variation results paly from a capability of the brain itself to suppress input of pain signals to thenervous system by activating a pain control system called an analgesia system. The analgesia system consists of three major components: (1) The periaqueductal gray and periventricular areas of the mesencephalon and upper pons surround the aqueduct of Sylvius and poions of the third and fouh ventricles. Neurons from these areas send signals to (2) the raphe magnus nucleus, a thin midline nucleus located in the lower pons and upper medulla, and the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis, located laterally in the medulla. From these nuclei, second-order signals are transmitted down the dorsolateral columns in the spinal cord to (3) a pain inhibitory complex located in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord. At this point, the analgesia signals can block the pain before it is relayed to the brain. Ref: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition page number:698,699,700",A

"Mechanism of action of cholera toxin: September 2007, 2009",Increase in c-AMP,Decrease in c-AMP,Activates Na+ K+ ATPase,Inhibit Na+ K+ ATPase,"Ans. A: Increase in c-AMP The debilitating loss of intestinal fluid is caused primarily by the release of cholera toxin, the main virulence factor of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Cholera toxin consists of an A subunit coupled to a B subunit: the A subunit consists of an Al domain containing the enzymatic active site, and an A2 domain while the B subunit contains five identical peptides that assemble into a pentameric ring surrounding a central pore. This AB; structure is closely related to the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which causes diarrhoea, often in infants. Symptoms begin when the massive secretion of water and sodium in the small intestine, a consequence of the activation of cyclic AMP, exceeds the resorptive capacity of the colon.",A
HIV affects which of the following most commonly,Helper cells,Suppressor cell,RBC's,Platelets,"Ref Robbins 9/e p246 The entry of HIV into cells requires the CD4 molecule, which acts as a high-affinity receptor for the virus (Fig. 4-27). This requirement explains the tropism of the virus for CD4+ T cells and its ability to infect other CD4+ cells, paicularly macrophages and DCs. However, binding to CD4 is not sufficient for infection; the HIV envelope gp120 must also bind to other cell surface molecules (coreceptors) to facilitate cell entry. Two cell surface chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, serve this role. HIV envelope gp120 (noncovalently attached to transmembrane gp41) binds initially to CD4 molecules (Fig. 4-27). This binding leads to a conformational change that exposes a new recognition site on gp120 for the core- ceptors CXCR4 (mostly on T cells) or CCR5 (mostly on macrophages). The gp41 then undergoes a conformational change that allows it to inse into the target membrane, and this process facilitates fusion of the virus with the cell. After fusion, the virus core containing the HIV genome enters the cytoplasm of the cell.",A
Which is responsible for respiratory drive:September 2007,O2,CO,CO2,Bicarbonate ions,"Ans. C: CO2Although the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels do not stimulate breathing. Rather, respiratory centre is directly stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels or excess hydrogen ions in the blood. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing air hunger.The respiratory centers try to maintain an aerial CO2 pressure of 40 mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the CO2 content of aerial blood may be lowered to 10-20 mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished.",C

Toughest layer in esophagus is,Mucosa,Submucosa,Muscularis,Adventitia,"The wall of oesophagus has the usual four layers viz., mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa and an external adventitia. The oesophagus does not have a serous covering except over a sho length near its lower end. The Mucosa - The mucous membrane of the oesophagus shows several longitudinal folds that disappear when the tube is distended. The mucosa is lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is normally not keratinised. Occasional melanocytes and endocrine cells are present. A columnar epithelium, similar to that lining the cardiac end of the stomach, may extend for some distance into the abdominal pa of the oesophagus. Finger-like processes (or papillae) of the connective tissue of the lamina propria project into the epithelial layer (just like dermal papillae). This helps to prevent separation of epithelium from underlying connective tissue. At the upper and lower ends of the oesophagus some tubuloalveolar mucous glands are present in the lamina propria. The muscularis mucosae is absent or poorly developed in the upper pa of the oesophagus. It is distinct in the lower pa of the oesophagus, and is thickest near the eosophagogastric junction. It consists chiefly of longitudinal muscular fibres, but a few circular fibres are also present. The Submucosa - The only special feature of the submucosa is the presence of compound tubuloalveolar mucous glands. Small aggregations of lymphoid tissue may be present in the submucosa, specially near the lower end. Some plasma cells and macrophages are also present. The Muscularis Externa- The muscle layer consists of the usual circular and longitudinal layers. However, it is unusual in that the muscle fibres are paly striated and paly smooth. In the upper one-third (or so) of the oesophagus the muscle fibres are entirely of the striated variety, while in the lower onethird all the fibres are of the smooth variety. Both types of fibres are present in the middle onethird of the oesophagus. The Adventitia - The muscle layer of the oesophagus is surrounded by dense fibrous tissue that forms an adventitial coat for the oesophagus. The lowest pa of the oesophagus is intra-abdominal and has a covering of peritoneum. REF : Inderbir Singh's Textbook of Human Histology, seventh edition, pg.no., 264,265.",C

Cardiac dominance is determined by coronary aery:,Supplying circulation to the SA node,Supplying circulation to the inferior poion of the interventricular septum,Supplying circulation to the interatrial septum,Supplying circulation to the anterior poion of the interventricular septum,"In 85% of patients the right coronary aery (RCA) is said to be 'dominant' because it supplies circulation to the inferior poion of the interventricular septum the right posterior descending coronary aery/posterior interventricular aery.In these cases the RCA travels to the cross-section of the AV groove and the posterior interventricular (IV groove). Here, it gives rise to the right posterior descending coronary aery (PDA) branch which travels in the posterior IV groove and gives off several septal perforator branches (SP). The SP supply blood to the lower poion of the IV septum. Generally, the dominant RCA also gives rise to the AV nodal branch which supplies blood to the AV nodeThe dominant RCA also provides the right postero-lateral (PLA) branch to the lower postero-lateral poion of the left ventricle.The sinus or sino-atrial (SA) node branch originates in the proximal poion of the RCA in 60% of cases and as a left atrial branch of the Cx in the remaining 40% of cases.

PKU is a congenital amino acid metabolic disorder. In one of the following rare variants of PKU Dihydro Biopterin synthesis is affected. The enzyme deficient is:,Histidine decarboxylase,Phenylalanine hydroxylase,Dihydropterin reductase,Tyrosine deficiency,"Ans:C.)Dihydropterin reductase.METABOLISM OF PHENYLALANINEOverview of pathway:Phenylalanine can be conveed into one of two products.If the a-amino group is removed from phenylalanine, it is transformed into phenylpyruvate, which is eventually broken down into fumarate and entered into the citric acid cycle.Alternatively, phenylalanine can be used to synthesize tyrosine. The conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine is catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase .* Impoant enzymes:Phenylalanine hydroxylase: Hydroxylates phenylalanine to tyrosine. Requires tetrahydrobiopterin and O 2 as cofactors.Dihydrobiopterin reductase: Regenerates tetrahydrobiopterin by reducing dihydrobiopterin to form tetra- hydrobiopterin. Requires a molecule of NADPH.* Diseases: When phenylalanine hydroxylase or dihydropteridine reductase is deficient, phenylketonuria results.Pathophysiology :When this enzyme is deficient, phenylalanine builds up. High levels of phenylalanine lead to severe brain damage by competitively inhibiting amino acid transpo required for protein synthesis, impairing polyribosome stabilization, reducing myelin production, and decreasing the formation of norepinephrine and serotonin.Phenylalanine is also a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the pathway of melanin synthesis, and thereby leads to hypopigmentation of the hair and skin.Clinical ManifestationsMental and growth retardation ; microcephaly; decreased pigmentation (blonde and blue-eyed) ; eczema; 'mousy' body odor; heavy perspiration; musty urine odor; hypeonia, hyperreflexia.Lab findings: Phenylketones detected in urine (phenylacetate, phenyllactate, and phenyl-pyruvate); positive Guthrie test (measures phenylalanine in blood) at bih.Treatment :Decreased intake of phenylalanine (avoid aspaame, which is found in Nutrasweet) and increased dietary tyrosine (essential amino acids for patients with this disorder).",C

All develop from mesoderm except,Skeletal muscle,Testes,Enamel,Ureter,"In all bilaterian animals, the mesoderm is one of the three primary germ layers in the very early embryo. The other two layers are the ectoderm (outside layer) and endoderm (inside layer), with the mesoderm as the middle layer between them. The mesoderm forms mesencyme, mesothelium, non-epithelial blood cells and coelomocytes. Mesothelium lines coeloms. Mesoderm forms the muscles in a process known as myogenesis, septa (cross-wise paitions) and mesenteries (length-wise paitions); and forms pa of the gonads (the rest being the gametes).Myogenesis is specifically a function of mesemchyme. The mesoderm differentiates from the rest of the embryo through inercellular signalling, after which the mesoderm is polarized by an organizng center. The position of the organizing center is in turn determined by the regions in which beta-catenin is protected from degradation by GSK-3. Beta-catenin acts as a co-factor that alters the activity of the transcription factor tcf-3 from repressing to activating, which initiates the synthesis of gene products critical for mesoderm differentiation and gastrulation. Fuhermore, mesoderm has the capability to induce the growth of other structures, such as the neural plate, the precursor to the nervous system. Ref - wikipedia.org",C

MCHC is increased in,Iron deficiency anaemia,Spherocytosis,Thalassemia,All,"Ref Robbins 9/e p633 MCHC can be elevated ('polychromatic') in hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell disease and homozygous haemoglobin C disease, depending upon the hemocytometer. MCHCcan be elevated in some megaloblastic anemias. Spherocytosis most often refers to hereditary spherocytosis. This is caused by a molecular defect in one or more of the proteins of the red blood cell cytoskeleton, including spectrin, ankyrin, Band 3, or Protein 4.2. Because the cell skeleton has a defect, the blood cell contracts to a sphere, which is its most surface tension efficient and least flexible configuration. Though the spherocytes have a smaller surface area through which oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged, they in themselves perform adequately to maintain healthy oxygen supplies. However, they have a high osmotic fragility--when placed into water, they are more likely to burst than normal red blood cells. These cells are more prone to physical degradation.",B
A 38-year-old female presents to the physician with complaints of excessive thirst and urination for the past 4 weeks. Her appetite has been normal and she has not had diarrhea. Blood chemistry showed mildly elevated glucose and glucagon. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the left upper quadrant and an erythematous necrotizing skin eruption on her legs. Radiographic studies show a tumor in the pancreas. Which of the following cells is responsible for this lesion?,Acinar cell,Alpha cell,Beta cell,Delta cell,"The symptoms described are typical for a patient with glucagon excess. Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Increased levels are rare, usually due to carcinoma (70%) or adenoma (30%) of the islets. Two-thirds of patients with carcinoma have liver metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Increased glucagon causes a syndrome similar to diabetes mellitus, due to antagonism of insulin effects. Patients also have migratory skin rashes, alopecia, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and glossitis. Diagnosis is made by measuring glucagon. The acinar cell, the main exocrine cell of the pancreas, contains digestive enzymes. Increases in the release of these enzymes (especially amylase and lipase) occur with pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is considered an emergent medical condition. Chronic pancreatitis is associated with fibrosis and atrophy of the acinar structures. Beta cells are responsible for insulin release. An adenoma of beta cells (insulinoma) would cause hyperinsulinism. 70% are solitary and 10% are multiple. Insulinomas cause hypoglycemia, dizziness, confusion, and excessive sweating. Glucose needs to be given promptly to avoid coma and death. Diagnosis is made by finding increased insulin and hypoglycemia. Delta cells are islet cells that secrete somatostatin. Tumors producing increased somatostatin are usually malignant. Clinically, a diabetes mellitus-like syndrome occurs along with diarrhea. Diagnosis is made from elevated serum somatostatin levels, but can be difficult because of the hormone's sho half-life. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 24.

Metabolic bone disease is caused by excess intake of which vitamin?,A,B,C,D,"Metabolic bone disease is caused by excess intake of vitamin -A.Retinoic acid has a role in the regulation of gene expression and differentiation of tissues. All-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis retinoic acid act like steroid hormones. They bind to nuclear receptors; retinoic acid along with the receptor binds to the response elements of DNA. Retinoic acid receptors (RAR) bind all-trans-retinoic acid, while retinoic x receptors (RXR) bind to 9-cis-retinoic acid. RXRs form dimers with vitamin D-receptor also. This explains why deficiency of vitamin A impairs vitamin D function; when there is lack of 9-cis-retinoic acid to receptor dimers, vitamin D function is not optimal.Ref: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 6th edition, page no: 382,383",A

This makes sense, because with a fight or flight response, heart rate increases, as a consequence of:# | Conduction velocity (Positive dromotropic)# | Refractory period (so that cardiac tissue becomes excitable in a shorter span on time)2. Blood vessels* Stimulation of cq receptors cause vasoconstriction. Stimulation of b2 receptors cause vasodilation. Vasoconstriction (a1 receptors) predominate in skin, mucosal, renal and sphlanchnic blood vessels. Dilatation (b2 receptors) predominate in skeletal muscles, liver and coronary blood vessels. The direct effect on cerebral vessels is not prominent - blood flow through this bed parallels change in BP. Renal vessels contain bothaI (vasoconstriction) and (vasodilatiator) receptor. Therefore sympathetic stimulation cause less increase in vascular resistance as compared to other sites where sympathetic stimulation causes vasconstriction.3. Urinary system* Relaxation of detrusor (b2 action) and contraction of trigone (a1 action) - urinary retention.4. GIT* Relaxation of smooth muscles by direct action of b2 receptors and indirect action of a2 receptors (a2 receptors decrease the release of ACH by acting presynaptically on cholinergic neurons).5. Respiratory system* Bronchial smooth muscles have b2 receptors but no sympathetic supply. b2 receptor agonists (exogenous drugs) can cause bronchodilation.

Release of proenzymes from the pancreatic acinar cells is accomplished by which of the following processes?,Exocytosis,Transcytosis,Apoptosis,Endocytosis,"The membrane of the zymogen granule fuses with the apical cell membrane to release the proenzymes synthesized by the pancreatic acinar cells into the acinar lumen. This is exocytosis. Transcytosis describes the transit through the cytoplasm of ceain materials, such as immunoglobulin A, from one surface of a cell to another. Such materials are taken up into vesicles by receptor-mediated endocytosis and are subsequently released by exocytosis. Endocytosis and phagocytosis are processes by which materials are taken into cells by invagination or other deformation of the plasma membrane. Apoptosis is programmed cell death, an impoant cellular process, but not related to secretion. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 2.

Negative intrapleural pressure is due to?,Lymphatic drainage from plural cavity,Equally distributed surfactant,Negative pressure in alveoli,Presence of cartilaginous ring at the upper airway,"Ans. A. Lymphatic drainage from plural cavityPleural cavity is a closed cavity. And the pressure is always negative due to the following factors:a. The lungs have a tendency to recoil inwards, therefore visceral pleura is pulled inwards.b. Surface tension also help by creating an inward force in alveoli.c. The thorax has a tendency to recoil outwards, pulling parietal pleura with it. Therefore, the pleural cavity is stretched on both sides leading to increase in its volume and decrease pressure inside. And it becomes negative.d. Also there is a continuous Lymphatic drainage from pleural cavity, which creates a suction force in pleural cavity, keeping the pressure negative.e. Note: Surfactant by decreasing Surface tension actually opposes the negative pressure.f. And pressure in alveoli is same as atmospheric pressure, taken as ZERO.",A

Both a- and b- subunits span across the membrane with an intracellular and an extracellular sites.* Na+ and K+ transport occurs through a-subunits. Intracellular portion of a-subunit has three Na+ binding sites (three receptor sites for Na+), an ATP binding site, a phosphorylating site and ATPase activity. Extracellular portion has two K+ binding sites (two receptor sites for K+), and an oubain binding site. The b-subunit has three extracellular glycosylation sites, all of which appear to have attached carbohydrate residue.Function* The Na+ - K+ pump is an electrogenic pump since it produces a net movement of positive charge out of the cell. Thus, besides maintaining the ionic composition of the intracellular fluid, the Na+ - K+ pump helps to maintain the electrochemical potential difference across the cell membrane. However, Na+ - K+ pump contributes only 4 millivolts to total resting membrane potential of 90 volts which is almost negligble.* Active transport of Na+ and K+ is one of the major energy using process in the body. On the average, it accounts for about 24% of the energy utilized by cell and in neurons it accounts for 70%.* Activity of Na+ - K+ pump is stimulated by increased intracellular concentration of Na+, thyroid hormones, aldosterone and insulin. Pump activity is inhibited by CHF, CRF, digoxin toxicity and dopamine.",B

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is classified as,Allergic reaction,Type2 hypersensitivity,Immune complex mediated hypersensitivity,Cell mediated hypersensitivity,"Ref Robbins 9/e p117 Once complexes are deposited in the tissue, the third phase, the inflammatory reaction, ensues. During this phase (approximately 10 days after antigen administration), clini- cal features such as fever, uicaria, ahralgias, lymph node enlargement, and proteinuria appear. Wherever immune complexes deposit, characteristic tissue damage occurs. The immune complexes activate the complement system, leading to the release of biologically active frag- ments such as the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), which increase vascular permeability and are chemotactic for neutrophils and monocytes (Chapter 2). The complexes also bind to Fcg receptors on neutrophils and monocytes, activating these cells. Attempted phagocytosis of immune complexes by the leukocytes results in the secretion of a variety of additional pro-inflammatory substances, includ- ing prostaglandins, vasodilator peptides, and chemotactic substances, as well as lysosomal enzymes capable of digest- ing basement membrane, collagen, elastin, and cailage, and reactive-oxygen species that damage tissues. Immune complexes can also cause platelet aggregation and activate Hageman factor; both of these reactions augment the inflammatory process and initiate formation of micro- thrombi, which contribute to the tissue injury by producing local ischemia (Fig. 4-11). The resultant pathologic lesion is termed vasculitis if it occurs in blood vessels, glomerulo- nephritis if it occurs in renal glomeruli, ahritis if it occurs in the joints, and so on. Predictably, the antibody classes that induce such lesions are complement-fixing antibodies (i.e., IgG and IgM) and antibodies that bind to phagocyte Fc receptors (IgG). During the active phase of the disease, consumption of complement may result in decreased serum complement levels. The role of complement- and Fc receptor-dependent inflammation in the pathogenesis of the tissue injury is suppoed by the observation that experimental depletion of serum complement levels or knockout of Fc receptors in mice greatly reduces the severity of lesions, as does deple- tion of neutrophils.",C

Why is the blind spot on the retina not usually perceived?,"It is very small, below the ability of the sensory cells to detect",It is present only in very young children,Its location in the visual field is different in each eye,Constant eye motion prevents the spot from remaining still,"Ans. C. Its location in the visual field is different in each eyeRods and cones are absent from the area of the retina where the optic nerve exits. The blind spot is of appreciable size, but because its location is off-center and the eyeballs are mirror images, each eye fills in the information missing from the other, even when the gaze is fixed at a point. There are no connections from lateral cells to the blind spot because nerves are exiting there and do not make synapses.",C

ATP is generated in ETC by,Na+ k+ ATPase,Na+ CI- ATPase,FOF1 ATPase,ADP Kinase,"ATP SYNTHASE (COMPLEX V) It is a protein assembly in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is sometimes referred to as the 5th Complex (Figs 19.14 and 19.15). Proton pumping ATP synthase (otherwise called F1-Fo ATPase) is a multisubunit transmembrane protein. It has two functional units, named as F1 and Fo. It looks like a lollipop since the membrane-embedded Fo component and F1 are connected by a protein stalk. Fo Unit: The 'o' is pronounced as 'oh'; and not as 'zero'. The 'o' stands for oligomycin, as Fo is inhibited by oligomycin. Fo unit spans inner mitochondrial membrane. It serves as a proton channel, through which protons enter into mitochondria (Fig.19.14). Fo unit has 4 polypeptide chains and is connected to F1. Fo is water-insoluble whereas F1 is a water-soluble peripheral membrane protein. F1 Unit: It projects into the matrix. It catalyses the ATP synthesis (Fig. 19.14). F1 unit has 9 polypeptide chains, (3 alpha, 3 beta, 1 gamma, 1 sigma, 1 epsilon). The alpha chains have binding sites for ATP and ADP and beta chains have catalytic sites. ATP synthesis requires Mg++ ions. Mechanism of ATP synthesis: Translocation of protons carried out by the Fo catalyses the formation of the phospho-anhydride bond of ATP by F1. Coupling of the dissipation of proton gradient with ATP synthesis (oxidative phosphorylation) is through the interaction of F1 and Fo.Ref: DM Vasudevan Textbook of Medical Biochemistry, 6th edition, page no: 232",C

Which of the following structures has most likely been torn to cause the deviation?,Posterior longitudinal ligament,Tentorium cerebelli,Denticulate ligaments,Ligamentum flavum,The denticulate ligaments are lateral extensions of pia mater between the dorsal and ventral roots of the spinal nerves that attach to the dura mater. These ligaments function to keep the spinal cord in the midline position. The posterior longitudinal ligament supports the posterior aspect of the vertebrae within the vertebral canal. The tentorium cere- belli is a layer of dura mater that supports the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemispheres and covers the cerebellum. The ligamentum flavum helps maintain upright posture by connecting the laminae of two adjacent vertebrae. The nuchal ligament is a thickening of the supraspinous ligaments extending from the C7 vertebra to the external occipital protuberance.,C

Not a premalignant condition,Fragile X syndrome,Down's syndrome,Blount's syndrome,Fanconi's syndrome,"Ref Robbins 9/e p169 Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. Usually, males are more severely affected by this disorder than females. Affected individuals usually have delayed development of speech and language by age 2. Most males with fragile X syndrome have mild to moderate intellectual disability, while about one-third of affected females are intellectually disabled. Children with fragile X syndrome may also have anxiety and hyperactive behavior such as fidgeting or impulsive actions. They may have attention deficit disorder (ADD), which includes an impaired ability to maintain attention and difficulty focusing on specific tasks. About one-third of individuals with fragile X syndrome have features of fragile X syndrome. Most males and about half of females with fragile X syndrome have characteristic physical features that become more apparent with age. These features include a long and narrow face, large ears, a prominent jaw and forehead, unusually flexible fingers, flat feet, and in males, enlarged testicles (macroorchidism) after pubey. Fragile X syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of a gene in each cell causes the disorder. In most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. In women, the FMR1 gene premutation on the X chromosome can expand to more than 200 CGG repeats in cells that develop into eggs. This means that women with the premutation have an increased risk of having a child with fragile X syndrome. By contrast, the premutation in men does not expand to more than 200 repeats as it is passed to the next generation. Men pass the premutation only to their daughters. Their sons receive a Y chromosome, which does not include the FMR1 gene.",A

All are true about Autoimmune disease except ?,T cells recognise self antigen,Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an example,Higher incidence among males,Polyclonal B cell activation,"Ans. is 'c' i.e.Higher incidence among male The essential feature of an autoimmune disease is that tissue injury is caused by the immunologic reaction of the organism with its own tissues. Autoimmunity, on the other hand, refers merely to the presence of antibodies or T lymphocytes that react with self- antigens and does not necessarily imply that the development of self reactivity has pathogenic consequences. . Autoimmune diseases are syndromes caused by the activation of T or B cells or both, with no evidence of other causes such as infections or malignancies. Intense stimulation of T lymphocytes can produce nonspecific signals that bypass the need for antigen-specific helper T cells and lead to polyclonal Bcell activation with the formation of multiple autoantibodies. . It is now known that low levels of autoreactivity of T and B cells with self- antigens in the periphery are critical to their survival. .

Lung compliance is greatest at/during:,Sta of inspiration,Mid-inspiration,End-inspiration,End-expiration,"Static compliance of the lung is 200 mL/cm H2O. However, the compliance goes on changing with stages of a respiratory cycle. This changing compliance is 'dynamic compliance' of the lung. At the sta of inspiration, with smaller diameter of the alveoli, the surfactant molecules are concentrated over a small surface area; it makes the surfactant more effective in reducing the surface tension. Lower the surface tension, less is the collapsibility and greater is the distensibility (i.e., compliance). By the end of inspiration (with enlarged alveoli), surfactant molecules spread, making the surfactant less efficient in reducing surface tension. Greater the surface tension, lower is the compliance. However, if inspiration and expiration are compared, compliance will be more during expiration. During expiration, alveoli are becoming small and concentrating the surfactant molecules. The surface tension will be low; compliance will be high during expiration. So the lung compliance is greatest at the end of expiration.",D

The jejunum begins at the duodenojejunal angle, which is suppoed by a peritoneal fold known as the ligament of Treitz. There is no obvious line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum; however, the jejunum is commonly considered to make up the proximal two fifths of the small intestine, and the ileum makes up the remaining three fifths.

Acetylcholine receptors are decreased in:September 2009,Lambe-Eaton syndrome,Parkinson disease,Alzheimer disease,Myasthenia gravis,"Ans. D: Myasthenia gravisMyasthenia gravis is a serious and sometimes fatal disease in which skeletal muscles are weak and tire easily. It is caused by the formation of circulating antibodies to the muscle type of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These antibodies destroy some of the receptors and bind others to neighboring receptors, triggering their removal by endocytosis. The reason for the development of autoimmunity to acetylcholine receptors in this disease is still unknown. Another condition that resembles myasthenia gravis is Lambe-Eaton syndrome. In this condition, muscle weakness is caused by antibodies against one of the Ca2+ channels in the nerve endings at the neuromuscular junction. This decreases the normal Ca2+ influx that causes acetylcholine release. However, muscle strength increases with prolonged contractions as more Ca2+ is released.",D

Which of the following is not an inflammatory mediator,Tumor necrosis factor,Myeloperoxidase,Interferons,Interleukins,"steps: (1) migration and proliferation of fibroblasts into the site of injury and (2) deposition of ECM proteins produced by these cells. The recruitment and activation of fibroblasts to syn- thesize connective tissue proteins are driven by many growth factors, including PDGF, FGF-2 (described earlier), and TGF-b. The major source of these factors is inflamma- tory cells, paicularly macrophages, which are present at sites of injury and in granulation tissue. Sites of inflamma- tion are also rich in mast cells, and in the appropriate chemotactic milieu, lymphocytes may be present as well. Each of these cell types can secrete cytokines and growth factors that contribute to fibroblast proliferation and activation. As healing progresses, the number of proliferating fibroblasts and new vessels decreases; however, the fibro- blasts progressively assume a more synthetic phenotype, so there is increased deposition of ECM. Collagen synthe- sis, in paicular, is critical to the development of strength in a healing wound site. As described later, collagen syn- thesis by fibroblasts begins early in wound healing (days 3 to 5) and continues for several weeks, depending on the size of the wound. Net collagen accumulation, however, depends not only on increased synthesis but also on diminished collagen degradation (discussed later). Ulti- mately, the granulation tissue evolves into a scar composed of largely inactive, spindle-shaped fibroblasts, dense collagen, fragments of elastic tissue, and other ECM com- ponents (Fig. 2-30, B). As the scar matures, there is proA A gressive vascular regression, which eventually transforms the highly vascularized granulation tissue into a pale, largely avascular scar. Growth Factors Involved in ECM Deposition and Scar Formation Many growth factors are involved in these processes, including TGF-b, PDGF, and FGF. Because FGF also is involved in angiogenesis, it was described earlier. Here we briefly describe the major propeies of TGF-b and PDGF. * Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) belongs to a family of homologous polypeptides (TGF-b1, -b2, and -b3) that includes other cytokines such as bone morphogenetic proteins. The TGF-b1 isoform is widely distributed and is usually referred to as TGF-b. The active factor binds to two cell surface receptors with serine-threonine kinase activity, triggering the phosphorylation of transcription factors called Smads. TGF-b has many and often oppo- site effects, depending on the cell type and the metabolic state of the tissue. In the context of inflammation and repair, TGF-b has two main functions: TGF-b stimulates the production of collagen, fibro- nectin, and proteoglycans, and it inhibits collagen degradation by both decreasing proteinase activity and increasing the activity of tissue inhibitors of pro- teinases known as TIMPs (discussed later on). TGF-b is involved not only in scar formation after ref Robbins 9/e p83",B
"A patient of Acute lymphocytic leukemia with fever and neutropenia develops diarrhoea after administration of amoxicillin therapy, which of the following organism is most likely to be the causative agent -",Salmonella typhi,Clostridium difficile,Clostridium perfringens,Shigella flexneri,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Clostridium difficile It is a case of Clostridium difficile - induced diarrhoea.Clostridium difficile should always be considered as a possible cause of diarrhoea in cancer patients who have received antibiotics.Two factor favours this diagnosis a) Cancer patient - Cancer patients are predisposed to the development of clostridium difficile diarrhoea as a consequence of chemotherapy alone, (do not always require antibiotics).This is much more common among patients with AML and ALL, than among those with other types of cancer.

Monitoring of DNA denaturation in vitro is done by ?,Centrifugation,UV absorption,Chromatography,HPLC,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., UV absorptionDenaturation (melting) of DNADenaturation (melting) refers to separation of the two strands of the DNA into two component strands. When temperature of medium is raised, the hydrogen bonds linking of complementary base pair tends to break. As a result, separation of two strands occur. Melting temperature (Tm) indicates the temperature at which half of the double stranded structure is lost. Normally, Tm is between 85deg C and 95deg C.Since G and C are linked more strongly by three hydrogen bonds, in contrast to two hydrogen bonds linking A and T, G and C linking provides thermostability to DNA. Therefore, DNA molecules having higher GC content have relatively higher Tm. For every 10% increase in GC content, melting temperature increases by 5degC. Simple formula is -Tm (degC ) = 2 (number of AT base pairs) + 4 (number of GC base pairs)In addition to heat, alkali treatment and decrease of salt conentration also cause denatruation. Decrease in salt concentration decreases Tm. Therefore, increase in salt concentration increases DNA duplex stability. Denaturation affects propeies of DNA and these can be used to monitor strand separation -i) Hyperchomicity (hyperchromic effect) : DNA bases (purines and pyrimidines) absorb UV light of 260 nm. Upon denaturation, this optical absorbance is increased and is called hyperchromicity of denaturation or hyperchromic effect.ii) Viscosity : Viscosity of the DNA solution decreases on melting (denaturation) because single strands are more flexible than the stiff, resilient double helix.The separated strands of denatured DNA can rejoin on gradual cooling. This is called renaturation or reannealing.",B

Which one of the following findings is indicative of compromised LV performance?,increased left ventricular ejection time (LVET); normal pre-ejection period (PEP) and normal QS2 duration,PEP/LVET ratio = 0.35; shoened QS2 duration,PEP/LVET ratio > 0.35; no change in QS2duration,"Reduction in PEP, LVET, and QS2 duration","LV systole has the phases of pre-ejection isovolumic contraction and ejection. If total systole duration remains normal, but isovolumic contraction duration increases, it would mean the ejection time has reduced. It is indicative of a compromised LV performance. Exact measurement of the duration of isovolumetric ventricular contraction is done by using the following parameters: Total electromechanical systole (QS2), Pre-ejection period (PEP), and LV ejection time (LVET) These can be measured by recording: ECG ~ for the QRS complex; the Q wave indicates sta of ventricular depolarization or electrical systole, Phonocardiogram ~ to record hea sounds; 2nd hea sound will mark the end of systole, and Carotid pulse ~ to record LVET, which is from the beginning of carotid pressure rise to the dicrotic notch. QS2 = electromechanical systole; from the onset of QRS complex on ECG to the closure of semilunar valves - dicrotic notch on carotid pulse. PEP is calculated as ~ (Total electromechanical systole) - (ejection time) PEP = (QS2) - (LVET) PEP represents the electrical depolarization and isovolumic contraction of LV, that occur before the systolic ejection. The ratio PEP/LVET is normally about 0.35. If QS2 is normal but PEP/LVET ratio has increased, it means pre-ejection period has increased and the ejection time is reduced; it indicates a compromised LV performance.",C

This hepatitis virus is a defective virus in that it cannot replicate independently without the presence of hepatitis B virus.,Hepatitis A,Hepatitis B,Hepatitis C,Hepatitis D,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) possesses a single-stranded linear RNA genome while hepatitis B virus (HBV) contains a double-stranded DNA genome. Detection of anti-HAV IgM in a single serum specimen obtained in the acute or convalescent stage is the quickest and most reliable method to diagnose hepatitis A infection. This antibody is usually present at onset of symptoms and may persist 3 to 6 months. Demonstration of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in serum is the most common method of diagnosing HBV infection. Other serologic markers helpful in characterizing infection with HBV include hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc), anti-hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that immune serum globulin (ISG) can prevent clinical hepatitis A even when given up to 10 days after exposure. Similar studies have shown that ISG was able to decrease the incidence of hepatitis B infection in exposed persons. Purified, noninfectious HBsAg derived from healthy HBsAg carriers has been used as a vaccine for active immunization for HBV infection. Hepatitis C is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae. The viral reservoir is human. Recent retrospective 'lookbacks' suggest that many people were infected with HCV before testing of the blood supply was initiated in the early 1990s. HCV is treatable with combinations of drugs. The genotype of the virus plays an important role in the determination of length of therapy. Hepatitis D virus is an incomplete or defective virus which requires HBsAg as a cofactor. Both coinfection and secondary delta infection exist with secondary infection being the most serious. Hepatitis E virus is an RNA virus.

Professional antigen presenting cells,T-cells,B-cells,Dendritic cells,NK cell,"Antigen-presenting cells fall into two categories: professional and non-professional. Those that express MHC class II molecules along with co-stimulatory molecules and pattern recognition receptors are often called professional antigen-presenting cells. The non-professional APCs express MHC class I molecules.An antigen-presenting cell (APC) or accessory cell is a cell that displays antigen complexed with major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on their surfaces; this process is known as antigen presentation. T cells may recognize these complexes using their T cell receptors (TCRs). These cells process antigens and present them to T-cells. Professional antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells, present foreign antigens to helper T cells, while other cell types can present antigens originating inside the cell to cytotoxic T cells. In addition to the MHC family of proteins, antigen presentation relies on other specialized signalling molecules on the surfaces of both APCs and T cells.Dendritic cells (DC)Dendritic cells have the broadest range of antigen presentation and are necessary for activation of naive T cells. DCs present antigen to both helper and cytotoxic T cells. They can also perform cross-presentation, a process by which they present exogenous antigen on MHC class I molecules to cytotoxic T cells. Cross-presentation allows for the activation of these T cells. Dendritic cells also play a role in peripheral tolerance, which contributes to prevention of auto-immune disease.MacrophagesMacrophages can be stimulated by T cell secretion of interferon gamma. After this activation, macrophages are able to express MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules, including the B7 complex and can, present phagocytosed peptide fragments to helper T cells. Activation can assist pathogen-infected macrophages in clearing the infection.B cellsB cells can internalize antigen that binds to their B cell receptor and presents it to helper T cells. Unlike T cells, B cells can recognize soluble antigen for which their B cell receptor is specific. They can then process the antigen and present peptides using MHC class II molecules. When a T helper cell with a TCR specific for that peptide binds, the B cell marker CD40 binds to CD40L on the T cell surface. When activated by a T cell, a B cell can undergo antibody isotype switching, affinity maturation, as well as the formation of memory cells.",C

True about Cryptosporidium are all EXCEPT:,Spores chlorine resistant,Add fast spores,Spores > 100 micro meters,Enzyme immune assay done,"ANSWER: (C) Spores > 100 micro metersREF: Harrison s 18tK ed ch: 215Cryptosporidiosis is acquired by the consumption of oocystsSporozoites infect intestinal cellsparvum can spread from infected animals to humans. Since oocysts are immediately infectious when passed in feces, person-to-person transmission takes place in day-care centers and among household contacts and medical providers.Waterborne transmission (especially that of C. hominis) accounts for infections in travelers and for common- source epidemics.Oocysts are quite hardy and resist killing by routine chlorination. Both drinking water and recreational water (e.g., pools, waterslides) have been increasingly recognized as sources of infection.Clinical features:[?] Asymptomatic infections can occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts.[?] In immunocompetent persons, symptoms develop after an incubation period of 1 week and consist principally of watery nonbloody diarrhea, sometimes in conjunction with abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, fever, and./ or weight loss. In these hosts, the illness usually subsides after 1-2 weeks.[?] In contrast, in immunocompromised hosts (especially those with AIDS and CD4+ T cell counts <100/L), diarrhea can be chronic, persistent, and remarkably profuse, causing clinically significant fluid and electrolyte depletionDiagnosis:[?] Evaluation starts with fecal examination for small oocysts, which are smaller (4-5 micro meter in diameter) than the fecal stages of most other parasites.[?] Spores are acid fast.[?]Direct immunofluorescent stains and enzyme immunoassays can be done.[?] Cryptosporidia can also be identified by light and electron microscopy at the apical surfaces of intestinal epithelium from biopsy specimens of the small bowel and, less frequently, the large bowel.",C

Increased risk of Myocardial infarction is associated with which amino acid?,Valine,Ornithine,Methionine,Homocystine,"Homocysteine is a metabolite of the methionine cycle, is a strong independant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine is said to have a role in both atherogenesis and thrombogenesis. Risk factors for Atheresclerosis: Hypercholesterolemia Low HDL level Hypeension Male gender Diabetes mellitus Family with premature coronary aery disease High lipoprotein level Cigarette smoking Post menopausal state Hyper fibrinogenemia Hyperhomoeysteinemia Physical inactivity Obesity Angiotensin conveing enzyme polymorphism Homocysteine (Hcy) is a sulfydryl aminoacid that lies at an impoant metabolic branch point of methionine metabolism, between remethylation and transulfuration pathways. This lead to the formation of methionine and cystathionine respectively. Several enzymes regulate these pathways under normal condition in the presence of Vit. B12, B6 and Folic acid. Abnormality in any of the enzymes or vitamin deficiency may give rise to hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been classified as: Moderate (Hcy >15 to 30 mmol/L), Intermediate (Hcy >30 to 100 .mmol/L) and Severe (Hcy >100 mmol/L) Hyperhomocysteinemia and CVD Hyperhomocysteinemia induce smooth muscle proliferation, accelerate oxidation of LDL cholesterol, impair endothelial derived nitric oxide, decrease synthesis of heparan sulphate proteoglycan and also induce proinflammatory changes in the vessel wall. The exact mechanism of atherothrombosis associated with yperhomocysteinemia is not clear. Several studies have pointed to an association with inhibition of thrombomodulin activity, reduction of protein c activation, increased platelet aggregation, and predisposition to endothelial injury.

A. Oncotic pressure is higher in the blood column than that in glomerular capillariesThe factors governing filtration across the glomerular capillaries are the same as those governing filtration across all other capillaries, that is, the size of the capillary bed, the permeability of the capillaries, and the hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients across the capillary wall. For each nephron:GFR-Kf [(PGC -PT )-(pGC -pT )Kf , the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, is the product of the glomerular capillary wall hydraulic conductivity (ie, its permeability) and the effective filtration surface area. PGC is the mean hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, PT the mean hydrostatic pressure in the tubule (Bowman's space), pGC the oncotic pressure of the plasma in the glomerular capillaries, and pT the oncotic pressure of the filtrate in the tubulea. Now the oncotic pressure of the glomerular capillaries is the same as in any other systemic capillary i.e. 25 mm Hgb. Constriction of the afferent arteriole causes a fall in capillary BP resulting in decreased GFRc. Due to filteration of plasma, RBC are more in glomerular capillaries, so the GFR increases Concentration of all freely filtered substances like glucose are equal in glomerular capillaries and ultrafiltrate",A

"A woman who is heterozygous for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a polymorphic enzyme transcribed from the X chromosome, develops chronic myeloid leukemia. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) studies on the tumor cells for G6PD reveal that only a single form of the enzyme is transcribed. This finding suppos which of the following features of neoplasia?",Genetic mutation,Monoclonality,Mosaicism,Oncogene activation,"G6PD is an enzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism-it is neither an oncogene nor a tumor suppressor, and its altered expression in tumor cells is solely due to its location on the X chromosome. Each somatic cell expresses only one X chromosome, and thus only one of the two isotypes of G6PD. The presence of only one form of G6PD in the tumor cells reflects the monoclonal origin of the cells. Cells contained in the neoplasm express only a single isotype of G6PD because they are all derived from a single progenitor cell. Genetic mutation does not underlie the monotypic expression of G6PD in the tumor cells. The allele for G6PD not expressed in the monoclonal cell line was inactivated in embryogenesis (in the Barr body). Although genetic mutation is a requirement of neoplasia, it is not demonstrated by this phenomenon. Mosaicism is the expression of two or more different phenotypes heterogeneously throughout an organ or organism. Mosaicism usually reflects an asymmetry of mitotic division in embryogenesis. G6PD is not an oncogene, it is a metabolic enzyme expressed constitutively in all cells. Altered expression of G6PD does not produce any growth advantage in a cell. Ref: Van Solinge W.W., van Wijk R.

Enzyme responsible for the complete oxidation of glucose to CO2 to water is present in,Cytosol,Mitochondria,Lysosomes,Endoplasmic reticulum,"CITRIC ACID CYCLE Synonyms: TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle), Krebs' cycle, Krebs' citric acid cycle. Points to Remember * It is a cyclic process. * The cycle involves a sequence of compounds interrelated by oxidation-reduction and other reactions which finally produces CO2 and H2O. * It is the final common pathway of break down/catabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. (Phase III of metabolism). * Acetyl-CoA derived mainly from the oxidation of either glucose or b-oxidation of FA and paly from ceain amino acids combines with oxaloacetic acid (OAA) to form citrate the first reaction of citric acid cycle. In this reaction acetyl-CoA transfers its 'acetyl-group' (2-C) to OAA. * By stepwise dehydrogenations and loss of two molecules of CO2, accompanied by internal re-arrangements, the citric acid is reconveed to OAA, which again stas the cycle by taking up another acetyl group from acetyl-CoA. * A very small catalytic amount of OAA can bring about the complete oxidation of active-acetate. * Enzymes are located in the mitochondrial matrix, either free or attached to the inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which facilitates the transfer of reducing equivalents to the adjacent enzymes of the respiratory chain. * The whole process is aerobic, requiring O2 as the final oxidant of the reducing equivalents. Absence of O2 (anoxia) or paial deficiency of O2 (hypoxia) causes total or paial inhibition of the cycle. * The H atoms removed in the successive dehydrogenations are accepted by corresponding coenzymes. Reduced coenzymes transfer the reducing equivalents to the electron-transpo system, where oxidative phosphorylation produces ATP moleculesRef: MN Chatterjea Textbook of Medical Biochemistry, 8th edition, page no: 336",B

Substance which binds to substrate other than catalytic enzyme is,Competitive inhibitor,Non-competitive inhibitor,Reversible inhibitor,None of the above,"Non-competitive inhibition models a system where the inhibitor and the substrate may both be bound to the enzyme at any given time. When both the substrate and the inhibitor are bound, the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex cannot form product and can only be conveed back to the enzyme-substrate complex or the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Non-competitive inhibition is distinguished from generally mixed inhibition in that the inhibitor has an equal affinity for the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex.The most common mechanism of non-competitive inhibition involves reversible binding of the inhibitor to an allosteric site, but it is possible for the inhibitor to operate other means including direct binding to the active site. It differs from competitive inhibition in that the binding of the inhibitor does not prevent binding of substrate, and vice versa, it simply prevents product formation for a limited time.This type of inhibition reduces the maximum rate of a chemical reaction without changing the apparent binding affinity of the catalyst for the substrate",B

"A 40-year-old male is well controlled on warfarin for a factor V Leiden deficiency and recurrent deep vein thrombosis. He presents today with a community-acquired pneumonia and is placed on erythromycin. Three days later, he develops bleeding and his INR is 8.0 (indicating an increased time for blood clotting to occur, where INR is international normalized ratio). Which of the following best explains why this bleeding occurred?",The erythromycin inhibited cytochrome P450,The erythromycin stimulated cytochrome P450,The causative agent of the pneumonia inhibited vitamin K utilization,The causative agent of the pneumonia stimulated vitamin K utilization,"Warfarin is metabolized by a specific subset of induced P450 isozymes. The P450 system is used by cells to modify the xenobiotic (in this case the warfarin) such that it can be more easily excreted. Erythromycin, along with other macrolide antibiotics, inhibits the P450 oxidizing system, which in this case would lead to a higher blood level of warfarin and, therefore, the balance of clotting and bleeding is shifted toward excessive bleeding. A stimulation of P450 production by erythromycin would lead to a lower level of warfarin (because of increased metabolism and loss of warfarin by P450) and the potential for excessive clotting. This effect of P450 is a common drug-drug interaction. The causative agents of community- acquired pneumonia do not affect vitamin K absorption in the small intestine, or distribution throughout the body. Erythromycin does not affect mitochondrial transcription, although it may affect mitochondrial translation. Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, however, will not alter the inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity, and the increased levels of warfarin present, which may lead to increased bleeding.",A

Transfer of an amino group from an amino acid to an alpha keto acid is done by?,Transaminases,Aminases,Transketolase,Decarboxylase,"Ans:A.)TransaminaseTransaminase (Amino-transferases) transfer an a-amino (NH3+) group from L amino acid to an alpha keto acid.OVERVIEW OF AMINO ACID DEGRADATION* There are several steps involved in the degradation of amino acids.1. The a-amino group must be removed from the amino acid. This can be done either transamination or oxidative deamination .In transamination, enzymes, known as aminotransferases, act to remove the amino group from specific amino acids and transfer them to another molecule.Almost every amino acid has a specific aminotransferase. ALT: Transfers amino group from alanine to a-ketoglutarate, resulting in the formation of glutamate and pyruvate.AST: Transfers amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate, resulting in the formation of aspaate and a-ketoglutarate. Oxidative deamination acts to remove the amino group from glutamate and release it as ammonia.Stimulators: ADP and GDP activate glutamate dehydrogenase.Inhibitors: ATP and GTP inhibit glutamate dehydrogenase.2. Once the a-amino group is removed from the amino acid, the ammonia moiety must then be transpoed to the liver for metabolism into urea. This transpo occurs with the help of alanine and glutamine..3. Once in the liver, the ammonia moiety is transformed into urea the urea cycle .4. The remaining carbon skeleton are then degraded into intermediates of the citric acid cycle or can be used as building blocks for other molecules .5. The branched-chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, leucine) require specific enzyme complexes in order to be fully degraded .",A

Which brainstem-derived descending tract produces action similar to the lateral coicospinal tract?,Vestibulospinal,Reticulospinal,Spinocerebellar,Rubrospinal,"Descending motor pathways are organized into two major groups:Lateral pathways control both proximal and distal muscles and are responsible for most voluntary movements of arms and legs. They include thelateral coicospinal tract & rubrospinal tractMedial pathways control axial muscles and are responsible for posture, balance, and coarse control of axial and proximal muscles. They include thevestibulospinal tracts, reticulospinal tracts, and anterior coicospinal tractThe coicorubrospinal pathway serves as an accessory route for transmission of relatively discrete signals from the motor coex to the spinal cord. When the coicospinal fibers are destroyed but the coicorubrospinal pathway is intact, discrete movements can still occur, except that the movements for fine control of the fingers and hands are considerably impaired. Wrist movements are still functional, which is not the case when the coicorubrospinal pathway is also blocked.Therefore, the pathway through the red nucleus to the spinal cord is associated with the coicospinal system. Therefore, the coicospinal and rubrospinal tracts together are called the lateral motor system of the cord.Ref: Guyton; 13th edition; Chapter 56 Coical and Brain Stem Control of Motor Function",D

Which of these is not a method for introducing genes into a cell?,Transfection,Electroporation,FISH,Recombination,"Methods for introducing genes into a cell include, transfection (chemical based), electroporation (physical), infection (viral mediated) and recombination techniques. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescence-tagged probes to detect specific DNA sequences in tissue samples. It is not used for introducing genes into the cells. Methods for genetic manipulation: Transfection is the most commonly used method for introducing transgenes into human embryonic stem (hES) cells. This system is based on the use of carrier molecules that bind to foreign nucleic acids and introduce them into the cells through the plasma membrane. Electroporation is a method that employs the administration of sho electrical impulses that create transient pores in the cell membrane, allowing foreign DNA to enter into the cells. Infection is gene manipulation by viral infection which can produce a very high percentage of modified cells. Advantage over other systems are, high efficiency of DNA transfer (almost 100% efficiency) and single copy integrations. Recombination occurs by physical exchange of DNA. An endogenous gene can be replaced by a transfected gene using homologous recombination. Recombination is the result of crossing-over that occurs at chiasmata and involves two of the four chromatids.

Lipoprotein associated with carrying cholesterol from periphery tissues to liver is -,HDL ',LDL,VLDL,IDL,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., HDL o Lecithine-Cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) esterifes cholesterol in HDL during reverse cholesterol transport,o All nucleated cells in different tissues synthesize cholesterol, but the excretion of cholesterol is mainly by liver in the bile or by enterocytes in gut lumen. So, cholesterol must be transported from peripheral tissue to liver for excretion2. This is facilitated by HDLQ and is called reverse cholesterol transport because it transports the cholesterol in reverse direction to that is transported from liver to peripheral tissues through VLDL - LDL cycle.Processo HDL is synthesized in liver and small intestine. Nascent HDL contain phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol and Apo-Ar, C, E. This nascent HDL is secreted into circulation where it acquires additional unesterified cholesterol from peripheral tissues. Within the HDL particle, the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin - cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) to form cholesteryl ester and additional lipid are transported to HDL from VLDL and chylomicrons. Apo-A, activates LCAT.o There are two pathway by which this cholesterol is transported to liver.Indirect pathwayo Cholesteryl ester is transferred from HDL to VLDL and chylomicrons in exchange with triglyceride by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).o This cholesteryl ester is then transported to liver (see previous explanation).Direct pathwayo HDL cholesterol can also be taken up directly by hepatocytes via the scavenger receptors class BI (SR - BI).",A

D: Deep sleepAlpha waves generally are seen in all age groups but are most common in adults.They occur rhythmically on both sides of the head but are often slightly higher in amplitude on the nondominant side, especially in right-handed individuals.A normal alpha variant is noted when a harmonic of alpha frequency occurs in the posterior head regions.They tend to be present posteriorly more than anteriorly and are especially prominent with closed eyes and with relaxation.Alpha activity disappears normally with attention (e.g., mental arithmetic, stress, opening eyes).In most instances, it is regarded as a normal waveform.An abnormal exception is alpha coma, most often caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy of destructive processes in the pons (e.g., intracerebral hemorrhage).In alpha coma, alpha waves are distributed uniformly both anteriorly and posteriorly in patients who are unresponsive to stimuli.Beta waves are observed in all age groups.They tend to be small in amplitude and usually are symmetric and more evident anteriorly.Drugs, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, augment beta waves.Theta waves normally are seen in sleep at any age. In awake adults, these waves are abnormal if they occur in excess. Theta and delta waves are known collectively as slow waves.Delta waves are slow waves have a frequency of 3 Hz or less.They normally are seen in deep sleep in adults as well as in infants and children.Delta waves are abnormal in the awake adult.Often, they have the largest amplitude of all waves.Delta waves can be focal (local pathology) or diffuse (generalized dysfunction).",D

Which type of hypersensitivity reactions is seen in myasthenia gravis,Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction,Type 2 hypersensitivity reaction,Type3 hypersensitivity reaction,Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction,"Ref Robbins 8/e p203;9/e p 206 Antibodies cause disease by targeting cells for phagocyto- sis, by activating the complement system, and by interfer- ing with normal cellular functions (Fig. 4-10). The antibodies that are responsible typically are high-affinity antibodies capable of activating complement and binding to the Fc receptors of phagocytes. * Opsonization and phagocytosis. When circulating cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, are coated (opsonized) with autoantibodies, with or without complement pro- teins, the cells become targets for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. 4-10, A). These phagocytes express receptors for the Fc tails of IgG anti- bodies and for breakdown products of the C3 comple- ment protein, and use these receptors to bind and ingest opsonized paicles. Opsonized cells are usually elimi- nated in the spleen, and this is why splenectomy is ofclinical benefit in autoimmune thrombocytopenia and some forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. * Inflammation. Antibodies bound to cellular or tissue anti- gens activate the complement system by the 'classical' pathway (Fig. 4-10, B). Products of complement activa- tion serve several functions (see Fig. 2-18, Chapter 2), one of which is to recruit neutrophils and monocytes, triggering inflammation in tissues. Leukocytes may also be activated by engagement of Fc receptors, which rec- ognize the bound antibodies. This mechanism of injury is exemplified by Goodpasture syndrome and pemphi- gus vulgaris. * Antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction. In some cases, antibodies directed against cell surface receptors impair or dysregulate cellular function without causing cell injury or inflammation (Fig. 4-10, C). In myasthenia gravis, antibodies against acetylcholine receptors in the motor end plates of skeletal muscles inhibit neuromuscular transmission, with resultant muscle weakness. Antibodies can also stimulate cellularresponses excessively. In Graves disease, antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor stim- ulate thyroid epithelial cells to secrete thyroid hormones, resulting in hypehyroidism. Antibodies against hor- mones and other essential proteins can neutralize and block the actions of these molecules, causing functional derangements.",B

Stimulation of medial portion of vasomotor centre results in,Increased peripheral resistance,Increased blood pressure,Increased heart rate,Decreased cardiac output,"Ans. d). Decreased cardiac output. (Ref. Ganong Physiology 23rd/Chapter 33)Inflation of the lungs causes vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure. This response is mediated via vagal afferents from the lungs that inhibit vasomotor discharge. Pain usually causes a rise in blood pressure via afferent impulses in the reticular formation converging in the RVLM.VASOMOTOR CONTROL# Spinal reflex activity affects blood pressure, but the main control of blood pressure is exerted by groups of neurons in the medulla oblongata that are sometimes called the vasomotor area / center.# Neurons that mediate increased sympathetic discharge to blood vessels and the heart project directly to sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the intermediolateral gray column (IML) of the spinal cord.# On each side, the cell bodies of these neurons are located near the pial surface of the medulla in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). They contain PNMT, but it appears that the excitatory transmitter they secrete is glutamate rather than epinephrine.# When vasoconstrictor discharge increases, arteriolar constriction also increases and blood pressure rises.# Venoconstriction and a decrease in the stores of blood in the venous reservoirs usually accompany these changes, although changes in the capacitance vessels do not always parallel changes in the resistance vessels. Heart rate and stroke volume are increased because of activity in the sympathetic nerves to the heart, and cardiac output is increased.# Control of heart activity bx vasomotor center:# Lateral portions of vasomotor center transmit excitatory impulses through sympathetic fibers and increases heart rate and contractility.# Medial portion of vasomotor center- Lies in apposition to dorsal motor nuclei of vagus nerves- Transmits parasympathetic impulses through the vagus nerves to the heart to decrease heart rate. Vasomotor center can also decrease heart rate.Factors Affecting the Activity of the Vasomotor Area in the MedullaDirect stimulationCO2 and hypoxiaExcitatory inputsFrom cortex via hypothalamus.From pain pathways and muscles.From carotid and aortic chemoreceptorsInhibitory inputsFrom cortex via hypothalamus.From lungs.From carotid, aortic, and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors.",D
Lipopolysaccharide of gram negative bacteria ?,Hapten,Heterophile antibody,Stimulator for B lymphocytes,Induce cell mediated immunity,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Stimulator for B lymphocytes The biological activity of endotoxin is associated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). i) Toxicity is associated with lipid component (Lipid A). ii) Immunogenicity is associated with polysaccharide component. The cell wall antigen (0 antigen) of Gram-negative bacteria are components of LPS. LPS elicits a variety of inflammatory responses and activates alternate complement pathway. The susceptibility to infections induced by Gram-negative bacteria is largely determined by innate immune response to bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The stimulation of B-cells by LPS enhances their antigen-presenting capacity and is accompanied by B-cell proliferation and secretion of large qunatities of LPS neurilizing antibodies.",C

A 53-year-old white woman with end-stage renal disease received a kidney transplant and was maintained on an immunosuppressive regimen. Three months later she had a fever (38.3degC) and was found to have acute renal failure. Renal transplant biopsy was performed. Periodic acid-Schiff staining of a biopsy section showed yeast cells and hyphae. The most likely diagnosis for this patient is infection with,Aspergillus fumigatus,Candida albicans,Candida glabrata,Cryptococcus neoformans,"Immunosuppressive agents have reduced the incidence of rejection of transplanted solid organs but have increased risk of opportunistic infection. Fungal infections, while not the majority of infections in these patients, carry a high risk of mortality. Candida and Aspergillus are responsible for most of these opportunistic infections that can occur within a month or after several months. A. fumigatus (most common species) infections are primary pulmonary infections that may be a rapidly necrotizing pneumonia with a potential to disseminate. The organism is a mold in the environment and in the host. The hyphae are septate with acute angle, dichotomous, branching. Candida infections generally start as candidemia, which may reach the blood stream by catheters or translocation from the gut. C. albicans is the most frequent Candida isolate. This component of normal flora is generally in the yeast form as a commensal and when infection occurs the additional presence of hyphae and pseudo-hyphae is observed. C. glabrata, which is seen with increasing frequency, does not form hyphae. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast. Other fungi have been reported with less frequency.",B

Non-vitamin coenzyme is,Lipoic acid,CoA,S-adenosyl methionine,Niacin,"Vitamins are organic molecules that function in a wide variety of capacities within the body. The most prominent function of the vitamins is to serve as cofactors (co-enzymes) for enzymatic reactions. The distinguishing feature of the vitamins is that they generally cannot be synthesized by mammalian cells and, therefore, must be supplied in the diet. The vitamins are of two distinct types, water soluble and fat soluble Alpha-lipoic acid, LA, (chemical name: 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid; also known as thioctic acid), is a naturally occurring dithiol compound synthesized enzymatically in the mitochondrion from the medium-chain fatty acid octanoic acid. Because LA can be synthesized in the body it is not technically considered a vitamin but because of its vital role in overall cellular metabolism, it is considered as an impoant, but not necessary, dietary supplement. Given that LA is a necessary cofactor for mitochondrial a-ketoacid dehydrogenases, it thus serves a critical role in mitochondrial energy metabolism. In addition to de novo synthesis, LA is also absorbed intact from dietary sources, and it transiently accumulates in many tissues",A

Which of the following is the most sensitive test for Treponema?,VDRL,RPR,FTA-ABS,Kahn,"Treponemal tests detect antibody specific to T pallidum, such as an indirect immunofluorescent procedure called the fluorescent treponemal antibody (FTA-ABS), which uses spirochetes fixed to slides. ABS refers to an absorption step that removes nonspecific anti spirochetal antibodies often found in normal serum. FTA-ABS is the most sensitive test in all stages of syphilis, and is the best confirmatory test for a serum reactive to a screen such as RPR or VDRL. FTA-ABS antibodies rise more quickly in primary syphilis and remain positive in teiary syphilis. In late syphilis, approximately 1/3 of these patients may have a nonreactive VDRL or RPR. Therefore, if there is clinical suspicion of late syphilis and the VDRL or RPR is nonreactive, the FTA-ABS should be performed. This test is both sensitive and specific for syphilis infection. Less than 1% false positives are due to SLE, RA or old-age. All 1+ or minimally reactive results are considered equivocal; in the absence of historical or clinical evidence of treponemal infection, a second specimen should be submitted for serological testing.

So, cholesterol must be transported from peripheral tissue to liver for excretion. This is facilitated by HDL and is called reverse cholesterol transport because it transports the cholesterol in reverse direction to that is transported from liver to peripheral tissues through VLDL - LDL cycle.Processo HDL is synthesized in liver and small intestine. Nascent HDL contain phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol and Apo-A, C, E. This nascent HDL is secreted into circulation where it acquires additional unesterified cholesterol from peripheral tissues. Within the HDL particle, the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin - cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) to form cholesteryl ester and additional lipid are transported to HDL from VLDL and chylomicrons. Apo-A , activates LCAT.o There are two pathway by which this cholesterol is transported to liver1. Indirect pathwayCholesteryl ester is tranfered from HDL to VLDL and chylomicrons in exchange with triglyceride by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).This cholesteryl ester is then transported to liver (see previous explanation).2. Direct pathwayHDL cholesterol can also be taken up directly by hepatocytes via the scavenger receptors class BI (SR-BI).o This question is a direct repeat from NiBE based AJ 2013-14.",A

Isoenzymes can be differentiated from each other by,Agar gel electrophoresis,Heat stability,Substrate specificity,All of these,"Identification of Isoenzymes: In Agar gel or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the isoenzymes have different mobility. LDH, CK and ALP isoenzymes can be separated by electrophoresis. Heat stability: One of the isoenzymes may be easily denatured by heat, e.g. bone isoenzyme of ALP (BALP). Inhibitors: One of the isoenzymes may be sensitive to one inhibitor, e.g. tarate labile ACP. Km value or substrate specificity may be different for isoenzymes, e.g. glucokinase has high Km and hexokinase has low Km for glucose. glucokinase specifically acts on glucose as substrate while hexokinase can phosphorylate any hexose sugar. Co-factor requirements may be different for isoenzymes. Mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase is NAD+ dependent and the cytoplasmic isoenzyme is NADP+ dependent Tissue localization may be different for isoenzymes. H4 form of LDH is present in hea, while M4 variety is seen in skeletal muscle. Specific antibodies may identify different types of isoenzymes. For example, CK isoenzymes are separated by antibodies.",D

Which process involves formation of non essential amino acid from keto acid ?,Deamination,Transamination,Dehydrogenation,Oxidation,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Transamination o Transamination interconverts pairs of a-amino acids and a-keto-acids, i.e. one a-amino acid is converted to a keto- acid along with conversion of a keto-acid into an cx-amino-acid.Transaminationo Transamination involves the reversible transfer of a-amino group of a-amino acid to an a-keto acidQ to form a new amino acid and a new keto acid. The enzyme catalyze the reaction is called aminotransferase (transaminase). Most transaminases use a-ketoglutarate (a-keto acid) as a common acceptor of a-amino group of a-amino acids. All transaminases require pyridoxal phosphate (Vitamin B6) as a coenzymneQ. Some of the most important transaminases are: -i) Alanine transaminase (ALT) also called glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT): - It catalyzes the transfer of amino group of alanine to a-ketoglutarate resulting in formation of pyruvate and L-glutamate Q.ii) Aspartate transaminase (AST) also called glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) : It catalyzes the transfer of amino group of aspartate to a-ketoefutarate resulting in formation of oxaloacetate and L-glutamate. Qo Most amino acids undergo transamination reaction except lysine, threonine, proline and hydroxvproline.o All the amino groups from amino acids that undergo transamination are collected into one common amino acid, i.e., glutamate. This is important because L-glutamate is the only amino acid that undergoes oxidative deamination at an appreciable rate in mammalian tissue. Thus, formation of ammonia from amino acids occurs mainly via the a-amino nitrogen of glutamate. Transamination is not restricted to a-amino groups. The d-amino group of ornithine (but not the e-amino group of lysine) undergoes transmination,",B

B: Glutamtic acid, at position No.6 of beta-globin chain of haemoglobin is replaced by valine Sickle haemoglobin (HbS) is a structural variant of haemoglobin in which glutamic acid, an amino acid, at position No.6 of beta-globin chain of haemoglobin is replaced by valine. This happens due to change of a nucleotide, adenine to thymine (GAGgGTG) of codon 6 of beta-globin gene. This substitution of amino acid changes the net charge of haemoglobin, oxygen affinity and three-dimensional structure thus rendering it as unstable haemoglobin. Sickle haemoglobin gets polymerized at low oxygen tension and deforms the red blood cell from discoid shape to sickle like (crescent) form",B

"A 62-year-old woman is admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pains of uncertain origin. A CT scan reveals an aortic aneurysm affecting the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, resulting in ischemia to an abdominal organ. Which of the following organs is most likely affected?",Ileum,Transverse colon,Spleen,Stomach,"The ileum can become ischemic when arterial supply from the superior mesenteric artery is compromised. The superior mesenteric artery arises from the aorta posterior to the neck of the pancreas. It descends across the third part of the duodenum and enters the root of the mesentery behind the transverse colon. This artery gives origin to the following branches: inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery, middle colic artery, ileocolic artery, right colic artery, and intestinal arteries. The ileocolic artery descends behind the peritoneum toward the right and ends by dividing into the ascending colic artery, anterior and posterior cecal arteries, the appendicular artery, and ileal branches. The ileum is supplied by the ileal branches, which do not have any anastomoses with another major source vessel. The transverse colon is supplied by the marginal artery, which possesses anastomoses of the right colic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery, and the left colic artery arising from the inferior mesenteric artery. The spleen, stomach, and duodenum are all supplied by branches of the celiac trunk, which arise from the abdominal aorta just below the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm.",A
True about torsion of testis is all except,Presents with sudden pain in testis,Commonly associated with pyuria,Doppler U/S shows decreased blood flow to testis,Simultaneous orchidpexy of the other side should also be done,"Pyuria is associated with epidydimo-orchitis, not with torsion of testis. Torsion is the twisting of the testis on the spermatic cord, resulting in strangulation of the blood supply and infarction of testis. It is seen commonly in adolescents (10-25 yrs) Symptoms - it presents as sudden agonizing pain in the groin and the lower abdomen. Nausea and vomiting are very common. It must be differentiated from epidydimo-orchitis by: Prehn's sign - on elevation of testis the: pain increases -in torsion pain decreases in epidydimoorchitis Colour Doppler-detects the decreased blood flow to testis in torsion. It is the inv. of choice to exclude torsion from the epididymo-orchitis. Tc99m peechnate scan - it demonstrates decreased blood flow Management Immediate surgical exploration is indicated if testicular torsion is suspected because if treated within the first 4 to 6 hrs of onset of symptoms, the chances of testicular salvage is high. During surgical exploration the testis is detorsed to restore blood flow to the testicle. If ble, orchipexy of the affected and the contralateral testis is done. If the affected testicle is nonble, orchiectomy of the affected testicle and orchipexy of the contralateral testis is done. If the operating facility is not immediately available, manual detorsion can be tried. Ref : Bailey & Love 25/e p1379",B

Rossmann fold associated NADH domain is found in which enzyme?,Lactate dehydrogenase,Pyruvate dehydrogenase,Malate dehydrogenase,Isocitrate dehydrogenase,"Lactate dehydrogenase is comprised of two domains, an N-terminal NAD+ -binding domain and a C-terminal binding domain for the second substrate, pyruvate. Lactate dehydrogenase is one of the family of oxidoreductases that share a common N-terminal NAD(P)+ -binding domain known as the Rossmann fold. By fusing a segment of DNA coding for a Rossmann fold domain to that coding for a variety of C-terminal domains, a large family of oxidoreductases have evolved that utilize NAD(P)+ /NAD(P)H for the oxidation and reduction of a wide range of metabolites.

Which of the following clinical laboratory observations is suggestive of Hartnup disease?,Burnt-sugar smell in urine,High plasma phenylalanine levels,Extremely high levels of citrulline in urine,High fecal levels of tryptophan and indole derivatives,"Ans. D. High fecal levels of tryptophan and indole derivativesa. In Hartnup disease, a defect in the transport process for neutral amino acids is most pronounced in intestinal and renal transport. Neutral aminoaciduria is observed as well as increased fecal excretion of indole derivations due to bacterial conversion of unabsorbed dietary tryptophan.b. Pellagra-like symptoms can be seen-because of the lack of tryptophan for niacin biosynthesis. Hyper ammonia can be caused by a variety of urea cycle defects including carbamoyl phosphate synthase I deficiency (237300).c. The high levels of NH/ in the blood lead to very high levels of glutamine synthesis that may well be responsible for the subsequent brain damage. Deficiency of liver phenylalanine hydroxylase causes phenylketonuria . Consequently, high levels of phenylalanine are not converted to tyrosine.d. Phenylalanine and its metabolites accumulate in blood, leading to mental retardation if infants are not placed on a phenylalanine-restricted diet. Urine darkens upon standing because of the high levels of Homogentisate that result from of a deficiency in Homogentisate oxidase in the disease alkaptonuria (203500). This is a deficiency in the pathway of tyrosine breakdown.",D
Shock lung is characterized by,Alveolar proteinosis,Bronchiolitis obliterans,Diffuse pulmonary haemorrhage,Diffuse alveolar damage,"ref Robbins 7/r p715,9/e p134 Harrison 17/e p1680_1681 The cellular and tissue effects of shock are essentially those of hypoxic injury (Chapter 1) and are caused by a combina- tion of hypoperfusion and microvascular thrombosis. Although any organ can be affected, brain, hea, kidneys, adrenals, and gastrointestinal tract are most commonly involved. Fibrin thrombi can form in any tissue but typically are most readily visualized in kidney glomeruli. Adrenal cor- tical cell lipid depletion is akin to that seen in all forms of stress and reflects increased utilization of stored lipids for steroid synthesis. While the lungs are resistant to hypoxic injury in hypovolemic shock occurring after hemorrhage, sepsis or trauma can precipitate diffuse alveolar damage (Chapter 12), leading to so-called shock lung.",D

Where does capacitation of sperms occur in the reproductive tract?,Epididymis,Vas deferens,Vagina,Uterus,"After ejaculation into the female, spermatozoa move up the uterus to the isthmus of the uterine tubes where they slow down and undergo capacitation. Capacitation involves two components : increasing the motility of spermatozoa and facilitating their preparation for the acrosome reaction. From the isthmuses the capacitated spermatozoa move rapidly to the tubal ampullas, where feilization takes place. Spermatozoa attain progressive motility in the epidydimis. It involves activation of a unique set of proteins from the CatSper family, which are localized to the principal piece of the sperm tail. Ejaculation of the spermatozoon involves contractions of the vas deferens mediated in pa by P2X receptors, ligand-gated cation channels that respond to ATP.

Umami taste is evoked by ?,Glucose,Glutamic acid,Quinine,Sodium chloride,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Glutamic acidThere are four basic tastes namely Sweet, bitter Salty and Sour. There mechanisms of sensory transduction are :1) Sweet receptor is a G protein coupled receptor and leads to an increase in cAMP concentration in the sensory cells which results in closure of K+ channels and depolarization.2) Bitter receptors are also G protein coupled receptors and causes rise in intracellular Ca' by IP3-DAG system. Rise in intracellular Ca+2 triggers neurotransmitter release.3) Salty-tasting substances depolarize taste cells by activating amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels.4) Sour-tasting substances depolarize taste cells by raising the intracellular H + ion concentration, which causes closure of K+ channels.The umami taste is the fifth taste which is unique. The proposed mechanism of umami taste is through glutamate taste sensors (glutamate receptors) with release of neuronal glutamic acid.In nature, there are three umami substances :-i) Monosodium glutamate (MSG)ii) Disodium 51-guanosine mosphosphate (GMP)iii) Disodium 51-ionsine monophosphate (IMP)",B

It increases the synthesis of calcium binding protein calbindin.Calcitriol has opposite effects on bone, increasing both bone deposition and bone resorption. However, its net effect is increased mineralization of bone. Calcitriol stimulates osteoblasts which cause mineralization of bone. Activated osteoblasts secrete osteoclast stimulating factor which induce development of osteoclasts from their precursors (Osteoclasts themsleves do not have any calcitriol receptorQ). Osteoclastic activation promotes bone resorption.iii) In kidney calcitriol stimulates reabsorption of phosphate in proximal tubule and reabsorption of Ca+2 in the distal tubule.",C

Gene that encodes the toxin for cholera is transmitted by: September 2007,Protozoa,Bacteria,Bacteriophage,Fungus,"Ans. C: Bacteriophage A bacteriophage/phage is a virus that infects a bacterial cell, taking over the host cell's genetic material, reproducing itself, and eventually destroying the bacterium. Bacteriophages have two main components, protein coat and a nucleic acid core of DNA or RNA. Most DNA phages have double-stranded DNA, whereas phage RNA may be double or single-stranded. A filamentous bacteriophage transmits the gene that encodes the toxin for cholera. Cholera toxin genetic element CTX constitutes the genome of a filamentous bacteriophage (CTXf).

Salvage purine synthesis refers to ?,Synthesis of purine from ribose-5-phosphate,Synthesis of purine from pyrimidine,Synthesis of purine nucleotides from purine bases,None of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Synthesis of purine nucleotides from purine bases Two impoant purine nucleotides are synthesized : (i) adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and (ii) guanosine monophosphate (GMP). Then AMP and GMP are conveed to other purine nucleotides like ADP, ATP, GDP, GTP etc. Purine nucleotides can be synthesized by two pathways - (1) De novo synthesis and (2) Salvage pathway. De novo pathway (De novo synthesis) In de novo pathway, the purine nucleotides are synthesized from amphibolic intermediates. Amphibolic intermediates are the intermediary metabolites of amphibolic pathways (eg. citric acid cycle) which have dual purposes, i e. they serve in catabolism as well as in anabolism. In de novo synthesis, purine ring is formed from variety of precursors is assembled on ribose-5-phosphate. Precursors for de novo synthesis are ? Glycine provides Ca, C5 and N7 Aspaate provides N, Glutamine provides N3 and N9 Tetrahydrofolate derivatives furnish C2 and C8 Carbon dioxide provides Co Salvage pathway of purine nucleotide synthesis Free purine bases (adenine, guanine and hypoxanthine) and purine nucleosides are formed in cells during the metabolic degradation of nucleic acids and nucleotides. These free purine bases and purine nucleosides are reused in the formation of purine nucleotides. This is called salvage pathway (salvage means propey saved from loss).

"Per TCA with 3 NADH and 1 FADH2, generates how many ATP-",6,9,12,15,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., 9 o One N ADH produces 2.5 ATP and one FADH2 produces 1.5 ATP. Thus 3 NADH and 1 FADH2 will produce 9 ATP.o There is production of ATP at substrate level also. Thus total 10 ATP molecules are produced per cycle.Energetics of TCA cycles iKreb's cycle)o One turn of the TCA cycle, starting with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the starting molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2[?]5 ATPs and therefore, 12[?]5 ATPs are produced when starting compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle,o Note : Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from starting. Recent experiments shoiv that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2[?]5 ATPs and FADH produces T5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.o Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per moleeule of glucose wrhen it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows :- Method ofATP formationNo of ATPs gained perglucose (new calculation)No of ATPs As per old calculationPathwayStepEnzymeSource Glycolysis1 Hexokinase.Minus 1Minus 1Do3Pbosphofructoki nase-Minus 1Minus 1Do5Glyceraldehyde-3-p DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2 = 53x2=6Do61,3-BPG kinaseATPSubstrate level1x2= 21x2=2Do9Pyruvate kinaseATPSubstrate level1x2= 21x2=2Pyruvate to-PyruvateNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53x2=6Acetyl CoA Dehydrogenase TCA cycle3Isocitrate DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53x2=6Do4Alpha keto giutarate DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53x2=6Do5Succinate thiokinaseGTPSubstrate level1x2= 21x2=2Do6Succictnate DHFADH2Respiratory chain1-5x2= 32x2=4Do8Malate DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53 x 2= 6Net generation in glycolytic pathway 9 minus 2=710 minus 2=8Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction=5 =6Generation in citric acid cycle=20 =24Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole=32 =38",B
Cyanosis in trauma is interpreted as:,Early sign of hypoxia,Late sign of Hypoxia,Absence of cyanosis means adequate tissue ventilation,Absence of cyanosis means adequate tissue oxygenation,"late sign of Hypoxia Cyanosis is a late sign of hypoxia. In a trauma patient one should not wait for cyanosis to identify hypoxia and other signs of hypoxia should be looked for. If cyanosis is seen it means that hypoxia is profound. Reason- Cyanosis is seen when more than 5 g of hemoglobin per 100 mL of blood are desaturated. For a person with a normal hemoglobin concentration of 15 g/100 mL, cyanosis appears only when one-third of the blood is desaturated. Thus cyanosis appears late. Cyanosis may appear even later in a person with anemia. He may have a significant poion of the hemoglobin desaturated without displaying cyanosis. This individual will not appear cyanotic but may be profoundly hypoxic. (e.g. if an anemic person has haemoglobin conc. of 8 gm/100 mL, he will develop cyanosis only when more than 60% of his blood is desaturated.)

Which of the following physiological factor increases the urinary concentrating ability of the kidney?,ECF volume contraction,Increase in RBF,Reduction of medullary hyperosmolarity,Increase in GFR,"When a person is dehydrated, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is somewhat low and levels of ADH are high. The extraction of water in the coical collecting duct removes most of the water from the lumen (and makes it iso-osmotic with the coical interstitium ie, about 300 mOsm/kg). Then, as the remaining but greatly reduced, volume flows through the high osmolality medulla, fuher concentration occurs. The increased urea permeability signaled by ADH greatly assists in generating the medullary osmotic gradient by permitting the recycling of urea. Ref: Eaton D.C., Pooler J.P. (2009). Chapter 6.

First polar body is formed after -,Mitosis,First meiosis,Second meiosis,Fertilization,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., First meiosisOogenesiso Oogenesis refers to the process of formation of ova from the primitive germ cells. Unlike fetal testis (in which spermatogenesis beings at puberty ), the fetal ovary begins oogenesis by 10 weeks of gestation.o The sequence of events in oogenesis are :The primitive germ cells undergo mitotic divisions to form oogonia (diploid cells). Oogonium is unique in that it is the only female cell in which both 'X' chromosomes are active.The oogonia proliferate by mitosis to form primary oocytes (diploid cells).Primary oocytes formed from the oogonia enter a prolonged prophase (diplotene stage) of the first meiotic division and remain in this stage until ovulation occurs after puberty .Primary oocytes completes the first meiotic division at puberty just before ovulation to form secondary oocyte (haploid cell) and 1st polor body.Secondary oocyte immediately begins second meiotic division but this division stops at metaphase and is completed only if the mature ovum (ootid) is fertilized with sperm. At that time second polor body (polocyte) is extruded and the fertilized ovum proceeds to form a new individual. Fertilization normally occurs in the ampulla of fallopian tube.",B

Metabolites produced during this phase are 6- phosphoglucanolactone, 6-phosphogluconate and ribulose-5-phosphate. ii) Phase II (Non-oxidative reversible phase) : - During this phase, pentose phosphate is conveed to intermediates of glycolysis, i.e., glucose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Intermediary metabolites of this phase are xylulose-5-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, erythrose-4- phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. HMP shunt occurs in the cytosol. It is highly active in liver, adipose tissue, adrenal coex, lens, cornea, lactating (but not the nonlactating) mammary gland, Gonads (testis, ovary) and erythrocytes. Activity of this pathway is minimal in muscle and brain, where almost all of the glucose is degraded by glycolysis.",C
Fever occurs due to,IL1,Endorphin,Enkephalin,Histamine,"ref Robbins 8/e p61,66,9/e p83,90 IL-1 is intensely produced by tissue macrophages, monocytes, fibroblasts, and dendritic cells, but is also expressed by B lymphocytes, NK cells, microglia, and epithelial cells. They form an impoant pa of the inflammatory response of the body against infection. These cytokines increase the expression of adhesion factors on endothelial cells to enable transmigration (also called diapedesis) of immunocompetent cells, such as phagocytes, lymphocytes and others, to sites of infection. They also affect the activity of the hypothalamus, the thermoregulatory center, which leads to a rise in body temperature (fever) . That is why IL-1 is called an endogenous pyrogen. Besides fever, IL-1 also causes hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity), vasodilation and hypotension",A

This type of lesion occurs in weakness of which muscle?,Deltoid,Pectoralis major,Serratus Anterior,Infra scapular,"Ans. C. Serratus Anteriora. Winged scapula occurs due to damage to the serratus anterior muscle causes the deformation of the back.b. The serratus anterior muscle attaches to the medial anterior aspect of the scapula (i.e. it attaches on the side closest to the spine and runs along the side of the scapula that faces the ribcage) and normally anchor the scapula against the rib cage.c. When the serratus anterior contracts, upward rotation, abduction, and weak elevation of the scapula occurs, allowing the arm to be raised above the head.d. The long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior; therefore, damage to or impingement of this nerve can result in weakening or paralysis of the muscle.e. If this occurs, the scapula may slip away from the rib cage, giving it the wing-like appearance on the upper back.f. This characteristic may particularly be seen when the affected person pushes against resistance. The person may also have limited ability to lift their arm above their head.Causes:a. The most common cause of scapular winging is anterior paralysis. This is typically caused by damage (i.e. lesions) to the long thoracic nerve.b. This nerve supplies the serratus anterior, which is located on the side of the thorax and acts to pull the scapula forward.c. Serratus anterior palsy is a dysfunction that is characteristic of traumatic, non-traumatic, and idiopathic injury to the long thoracic nerve",C

Which of the following relays interneurons on anterior horn cell ?,Muscle spindle,Coicospinal tract,Spinothalamic tract,Spinocerebellar tract,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Coicospinal tractCoicospinal tract terminates on a-motor neuron (anterior or ventral horn cells) interneuron.PYRAMIDAL TRACT (COICOSPINAL TRACT)Coicospinal tract is the most impoant tract through which the motor coex controls the activity of the ventral horn cells (a-motor neurons) in the spinal cord. It is also called pyramidal tract because they form the pyramid of the medulla.The coicospinal tract originates about 30 percent from primary motor coex, 30 percent from premotor areas (premotor coex & supplementary motor area) and 40% from the somatosensory area. So, there are 40% sensory fibers in the coicospinal tract.After leaving the coex, it passes through the posterior limb of internal capsule and then downward through the brainstem, forming the pyramids of medulla. The majority (80%) of the pyramidal fibers then cross the lower medulla to the opposite side and descend as the lateral coicospinal tract and finally terminating principally on the interneuron in the intermediate region of gray matter. Some also terminate directly on the a-motor neuron, especially those concerned with skilled movement.A few fibers (20%) do not cross to the opposite in the medulla and descend ipsilaterally as anterior (ventral) coicospinal tract.The most impressive fibers in the pyramidal tract are a population of large (16 pm) myelinated fibers which originate from Giant pyramidal cells, called Betz cells, that are found only in primary motor coex. These fibers transmit the nerve impulses to the spinal cord at fastest speed. However, these fibers form only 3% of the total. The other 97% are mainly fibers smaller than 4 m in diameter that conduct background tonic signals to the motor areas of the cord.Coricospinal tract is concerned with voluntary activities of body- Voluntary control of movement is absolutely dependent on the activity of coicospinal fibers.",B

They permit movement of several molecules that are important for cellular function, such as ATP, H+, malate, pyruvate, citrate, glutamate, aspartate, a-ketoglutarate and phosphate.
It should be remembered that though shuttle systems move NADH produced in the cytosol into the mitochondria, there is no direct transporter for NADH. First reducing equivalent of NADH is transferred to malate which then is transported into the mitochondria and returns the reducing equivalent to mitochondrial NAD+ to form NADH. So, NADH is not transported but for one NADH produced in the cytosol one NADH is produced inside the mitochondria after transport of reducing equivalent by shuttle system.",D

Epigenetic deals with genetic modifications that do not alter the sequence of DNA. All of the following can detect epigenetic modification except:,HPLC,Methylation specific PCR,Bisulphite method,ChIP on Chip,"Ans. a. HPLC (Ref: Robbins 9/e p180, 319-320 8/e p180-181)Methylation specific PCR, Bisulphite method and ChlP on Chip can detect epigenetic modification but not the HPLC.'Epigenetics is defined as the study of heritable chemical modification of DNA or chromatin that does not alter the DNA sequence itself Examples of such modification include the methylation of DNA, and the methylation and acetylation of histones. Since traditional Sanger sequencing alone cannot detect DNA methylation; other techniques have been developed to uncover these chemical modifications. One common approach is to treat genomic DNA with sodium bisulfite, a chemical that converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil, white methylated cytosines are protected from modification. An assay termed methylation-specific PCR uses two PCR primer sets to analyze single DNA loci: one to detect a DNA sequence with unmethylated cytosines (which are converted to uracils after bisulfite treatment) and the other to detect DNA sequences with methylated cytosines (which remain cytosines after bisulfite treatment).Additional techniques are evolving that provide a genome-wide snapshot of epigenetically altered DNA. These techniques are based on the ability to detect histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation (which, like DNA methylation, are important regulators of gene expression) by using antibodies against specifically modified histones. Such antibodies can be used to pull down bound DNA sequences, a method termed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). These pulled- down sequences can be amplified and analyzed by hybridizing to microarrays ('ChIP on Chip') or sequencing ('ChIP- Seq') to map epigenetically modified genes throughout the genome. - Robbins 8/e p180 Isolation of cells of the immune response* Use the correct number of cells: 1 x 106 x to 10 x 106* Collect biological replicates of cells* Choose an appropriate control for antibody specificity (knockout or RNAi knockdown)Fragmentation by sonication or MNase treatment* Shear chromatin to a size range of ~ 150-300 bp* Sonicate chromatin extracts for non-histone proteinsSonication conditions should be determined empirically for each cell typeTreat chromatin extracts with MNase for analysis of histone modificationsDo not overdigest chromatinChIP analysis of histone modifications, transcription factors or epigenetic regulators* Select antibody: monoclonal versus polyclonal* Choose reference control (Input or IgG)* Perform ChIP with established protocols* Purify DNALibrary construction* Do end repair and adapter ligation* Perform PCR using primers compatible with sequencing platformAvoid overamplifying DNA Sequencing* Determine sequencing depth on the basis of the prevalence of binding throughout the genome: more sequencing tags may be needed for diffuse signals (such as H3K27me3)* Perform single-end or paired-end sequencingEpigenetic AlterationsEpigenetics is defined as the study of heritable chemical modification of DNA or chromatin that does not alter the DNA sequence itself.Examples of such modification include the methylation of DNA. and the methylation and acetylation of histonesQ.Since traditional Sanger sequencing alone cannot detect DNA methylation, other techniques have been developed to uncover these chemical modifications.One common approach is to treat genomic DNA with sodium bisulfite, a chemical that converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil, while methylated cytosines are protected from modificationQ.An assay termed methylation-specific PCR uses two PCR primer sets to analyze single DNA loci: one to detect a DNA sequence with unmethylated cytosines (which are converted to uracils after bisulfite treatment) and the other to detect DNA sequences with methylated cytosinesQ (which remain cytosines after bisulfite treatment).Additional techniques are evolving that provide a genome-wide snapshot of epigenetically altered DNA.These techniques are based on the ability to detect histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation (which, like DNA methylation, are important regulators of gene expression) by using antibodies against specifically modified histones.

"A 42-year-old man presents to his doctor with complaints of left-sided flank pain radiating into his groin. The pain began suddenly and has increased in intensity. He had a similar problem several years ago, but he did not seek medical attention, and his symptoms resolved spontaneously. He denies fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. He has had no diarrhea or difficulty urinating. Physical examination is remarkable for tenderness along the left flank and into the groin, but is otherwise normal. There are no inguinal hernias detected on examination. A urinalysis reveals microscopic hematuria without casts. Serum chemistry reveals: Sodium: 143 mEq/L Potassium: 2.4 mEq/L Bicarbonate: 17 mEq/L Chloride: 115 mEq/L Blood urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL Glucose: 85 mg/dL Which of the following is MOST likely present in this patient?",Normal acid-base status,Metabolic acidosis,Metabolic alkalosis,Respiratory acidosis,"This patient's bicarbonate is lower than the normal range of 22-28 mEq/L. This means that there is less bicarbonate in his blood than usual. If his breathing is normal, then his CO2 level should be about normal. Bicarbonate is produced when CO2 binds to an H2O molecule, which then splits into a H+ ion and a HCO3- (bicarbonate) ion. This reaction is governed by an equilibrium constant propoional to the concentrations of the products multiplied together over the concentrations of the reactants multiplied together. By convention, the 'water' concentration is ignored because it is 'constant.' So, in order for the equilibrium constant to not change value, the H+ concentration must increase if the bicarbonate decreases and the CO2 remains the same. This means that an acidosis is produced. In this case, it is a metabolic acidosis, since there is no indication of respiratory disease in this patient. Neither a normal acid-base status nor a metabolic alkalosis would have a low bicarbonate. Note: The hallmark of metabolic acidosis is decreased HCO3-. Metabolic acidosis are classified by the anion gap, either normal or increased. The anion gap is the difference between readily measured anions and cations. Ref: Cho K.C. (2013). Chapter 21.

Cortisol (glucocorticoid), growth hormone, adrenal medullary catecholamines (epinephrine), thyroxine and antidiuretic hormone (ADH).o Increased sympathetic discharge to the renal vessels coupled with hypovolemia (due to blood loss etc.) increase the secretion of renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone (because of activation of renin-angioensin system). Increased sympathetic discharge to the pancreas depresses insulin secretion and promotes the secretion of glucagon,o There is a decrease in the secretion of pituitary gonadotropin (LH, FSH).",C

Erythropoietin is secreted by -,Pituitary,Lung,Spleen,Kidney,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., KidneyErvthropoitino Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein hormone which stimulate erythrocyte production. Erythropoietin increases the number of erythropoietin sensitive committed stem cells in the bone marrow that are converted to red blood cells precursors and subsequently to mature erythrocytes. In the absence of erythropoietin, erythroid stem cellsundergo apoptosis.o In adults, about 85% of erythropoietin comes from the kidney (interstitial cells in peritubular capillary bed) and 15% from liver (Perivenous hepatoevtes). Small amount is also produced in brain; and uterus and oviducts. Certain tumors also produce erythropoietin, .e.g., Renal cell carcinoma. Hepatoma and cerebellar hemangioblastoma.o The most important stimulus for erythropoietin secretion is hypoxia. Other stimulus that can increase its secretion are cobalt salts, androgens, alkalosis due to high altitude, and catecholamines via b-adrenergic mechanism.o Pregnancy (due to placental lactogen), testosterone and prolactin increase the activity of erythropoietin. Estrogen inhibits utilization of erythropoietin by marrow cells and also impairs its production. Progesterone increase the effect of erythropoietin by enhancing the effect of placental lactogen and by antagonizing the effect of estrogen.",D

Which type of mutations usually involves mutation of a gene coding for the following molecule?,Silent mutation,Nonsence mutation,Missense mutation,Nonsense suppressor mutation,"A nonsense suppressor mutation is a secondary mutation that reverses the effect of a primary nonsense or chain-termination mutation. Ordinarily, no transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule can recognize a nonsense codon; therefore, protein synthesis terminates when the ribosome reaches such a codon. A nonsense suppressor mutation usually involves the mutation of a tRNA gene, so that the anticodon of the tRNA is altered to a sequence that is complementary to a nonsense codon. The altered tRNA can then bind to the nonsense codon and inse an amino acid at that point in the protein sequence. Thus, protein synthesis is allowed to continue, and the nonsense mutation is suppressed. A silent mutation is one that causes no change in the amino acid sequence of a protein. A missense mutation causes a single amino acid change. A frameshift mutation is the result of an inseion or deletion that alters the reading frame of the ribosome, leading to the production of a garbled amino acid sequence. Ref : Biochemistry by U.

Haldane effect is:,Effect of O2 on CO2 carriage in blood,Effect of CO2 on O2 carriage in blood,Effect of PCO2 on CO2 carriage in blood,Effect of pH on oxygen carriage in blood,"In the tissues, Hb unloads its oxygen and takes up CO2. CO2 enters red cells and combines with water to form H2CO3. CO2 + H2O - H2CO3 - H+ + HCO3- The H+ ions are taken up by the Hb (to form HHb); it is aided by the fact that deoxyhemoglobin is a better acceptor of H+. Also, deoxyhemoglobin more readily forms carbamino compounds. In lungs, the reactions are reversed. The inhaled O2 combines with Hb. Oxyhemoglobin is a better donor of H+; H+ is now released by Hb. H+ combines with HCO3- to form H2CO3. H2CO3 - CO2 + H2O. CO2 will be exhaled out. Thus, unloading of O2 in peripheral capillaries facilitates the loading of CO2, and oxygenation, in the lung-enhances the unloading of CO2. This has been termed 'Haldane effect'.

All of the following are increased in starvation except:,Lipolysis,Ketogenesis,Gluconeogenesis,Glycogenesis,"Ans.: D (Glycogenesis) STARVATIONWhen food intake decreases, the body enters the starvation response. Initially, the body's glycogen stores are used up in about 24 hours. The level of insulin in circulation is low and the level of glucagon is very high.The main means of energy production is lipolysis. Cluconeogenesis converts glycerol into glucose and the Cori cycle converts lactate into usable glucose.Two systems of energy enter the gluconeogenesis: proteolysis provides alanine and lactate produced from pyruvate, while acetyl CoA produces dissolved nutrients (Ketone bodies), which can be detected in urine and are used by the brain as a source of energy.In terms of insulin resistance, starvation conditions make more glucose available to the brain.",D

Which of the following does not undergo phosphorylation by protein kinases?,Threonine,Tyrosine,Asparagine,Serine,"Phosphorylation occurs at the hydroxyl groups of serine, threonine, and tyrosine. A protein kinase is a kinase enzyme that modifies other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups to them (phosphorylation). Phosphorylation usually results in a functional change of the target protein (substrate) by changing enzyme activity, cellular location, or association with other proteins. The chemical activity of a kinase involves transferring a phosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate (usually ATP) and covalently attaching it to one of three amino acids that have a free hydroxyl group.Most kinases act on both serine and threonine, others act on tyrosine, and a number (dual specificity kinases) act on all three. There are also protein kinases that phosphorylate other amino acids, including histidine kinases that phosphorylate histidine residues.",C

"All are true about Vitamin B12, except",Active form is methylcobalamine,Requires for conversion of homocysteine to methionine,Requires in metabolism of methylmalonyl CoA,Requires for conversion of pyruvate to lactate,"Vitamin B12 is required in humans for two essential enzymatic reactions: the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and the isomerization of methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA) that is produced during the degradation of some amino acids (isoleucine, valine, threonine, and methionine), and fatty acids with odd numbers of carbon atoms (Figure 28.5). When the vitamin is deficient, unusual fatty acids accumulate and become incorporated into cell membranes, including those of the nervous system. This may account for some of the neurologic manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency. A. Structure of cobalamin and its coenzyme forms Cobalamin contains a corrin ring system that differs from the porphyrins in that two of the pyrrole rings are linked directly rather than through a methene bridge. Cobalt is held in the center of the corrin ring by four coordination bonds from the nitrogens of the pyrrole groups. The remaining coordination bonds of the cobalt are with the nitrogen of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole and with cyanide in commercial preparations of the vitamin in the form of cyanocobalamin (Figure 28.6). The coenzyme forms of cobalamin are 5&;-deoxy adenosylcobalamin, in which cyanide is replaced with 5&;-deoxyadenosine (forming an unusual carbon-cobalt bond), and methylcobalamin, in which cyanide is replaced by a methyl group Reference: Lippincott edition 5: page no: 375",D

Myosin and actin filaments are kept in place by -,Tropomyosin,Troponin,Actinin,Titin,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Titin o The side-by-side relationship between the myosin and actin filaments is difficult to maintain.o This is achieved by a large number of filamentous molecules of a protein called titin.o Titin molecules act as a framework that holds the myosin and actin filaments in place so that the contractile machinery of the sarcomere will work.Important muscle proteins1. Myosin Myosin is the protein that constitutes the thick filaments. Myosin of skeletal muscle is myosin-II. Myosin participates in the contractile mechanism and also acts as an ATPase.2. Actin :- Actin is the major protein of thin filament. It is the actin which slides over myosin during contraction.3. Tropomyosin : - It is the other protein of thin filament. It covers the active sites (myosin binding sites) on actin. When Ca+2 concentration of cytoplasm (sarcoplasm) is raised, it uncovers the active sites of actin and allow the contraction So, the 'cross-bridge cycling ' is switched off 'or on by the tropomyosin molecule which slides on the actin molecule to cover or uncover the active sites on it.4. Troponin It is a protein also associated with thin filament. The regulatory action of Ca+2 on tropomysin is mediated by troponin, a Ca+2 binding protein. When the cytoplasmic (sarcoplasmic) Ca+2 concentration rises Ca+2 ions bind to troponin-C. The troponin - Ca+2- complex induces changes in Troponin-I and Troponin-T, which in turn brings about a shift of tropomyosin away from the active sites of actin. When the sarcoplasmic Ca+2 concentration falls, Ca+2 dissociates from troponin-C and tropomyosin slides back on the actin filament to cover the active sites. Thus, the first event during muscle contraction, after cytoplasmic rise in Ca+2 concentration, is binding of troponin C to Ca+2 which trigers the further steps by sliding the tropomysin away from the active sites of actin.o There are additional structural proteins in skeletal muscles.Actinin : It binds actin to Z-lines.Thin : It is the largest known protein and connects Z-Iines to M-linesand is responsible for passive stiffness of muscle, by limiting range of motion of sarcomere in tension.Desntin : It adds structures to Z-lines in part by binding the Z-lines to plasma membrane.",D

In caissons disease pain in joint is because of -,Nitrogen bubble,Oxygen bubble,Carbon monoxide,Air in joint,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Nitrogen bubble Caisson's diseaseo Caisson's disease, (also called decompression sicknessQ, Bendst Diver's Paralysis, Dysbarism) is a particular form of gas embolism, which occurs when individuals are exposed to sudden lowering of atmospheric pressure like - rapid ascend of scuba and deep sea divers0, individuals in unpressurized aircraft in rapid ascent (e.g., in pilotsQ), underwater construction workers and extra-vehicular activity from spacecraft.o When air is breathed at high pressure (e.g., during a deep sea dive), increased amounts of gas (particularly nitrogen) become dissolved in the blood and tissues. If the diver then ascends (depressurizes) too rapidly, the nitrogen expands in the tissues and bubbles out of solution in the blood to form gas emboli.o Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of the body, it can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from joint pain, ischemia in tissues to paralysis and death,o The rapid formation of gas bubbles within skeletal muscles and supporting tissues in and about joints is responsible for the painful condition called the bends. In the lungs, edema hemorrhages, and focal atelectasis or emphysema may appear, leading to respiratory distress, the so-called chokes,o Treatment of gas embolism requires placing the individual in a compression chamber where the barometric pressure may be raised, thus forcing the gas bubbles back into solution.

Counter current multiplier system is primarily driven by ?,Concentration of Na+,H+ at loop of Henle,Concentration of Na+-,"H+ at ascending loop of henle, Osmolality at Loop of Henle","Ans. is 'a' i.e., Concentration of Na+Countercurrent multiplierThe loop of HenleQ gives the nephron a peculiar shape. The descending limb, in which the tubular fluid flows towards the hairpin bend (downwords) and the ascending limb, in which the tubular fluid flows 'upwards' lie close to each other. Two such tubes with fluid flowing through them in opposite directions provide an oppounity for the countercurrent multiplication.The thick ascending limb of loop of Henle is impermeable to water but it actively reabsorbs NaCI. The thin descending limb of loop of Henle is relatively impermeable to solutes but highly permeable to water. The most impoant cause of the high medullary osmolarity is active transpo of sodiumQ and co-transpo of potassiumQ, chlorideQ and other ions out of the thick ascending limb of loop of HenleQ into the medullary interstitium. Most impoant among all these is NaClQ, for maintenance of high medullary interstitium.Consider the Na+ is continuously flowing in from glomerulus into the tubule. However, most of the Na+, instead of flowing out, gets trapped in a circular path and recycles between the ascending and descending limbs of the loop of Henle. Consequently, the Na+ concentration becomes very high at the tip of the loop.",A

Equilibrium potential for an ion is calculated using-,Gibbs-Donnan equation,Nernst equation,Goldman equation,Fick's law,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Nernst equation Nernst equation o When two ionic solutions (ions) A and B of different concentration (CA and CB) of an ion separated by a permeable membrane, the ions tend to diffuse along their concentration gradient. Since ions are charged particles their diffusion can be stopped by an appropriate electrical potential (E) applied across the membrane o The magnitude and polarity of the potential (equilibrium potential) that must be applied to side A of the membrane for stopping the diffusion of ions (EA) is given by Nernst equation, i.e., the equilibrium potential for an ion is calculated by Nernst equation. o For example, if solution A contains an ion with a negative charge in more concentration than the concentration of the same ion in solution B, the ion will diffuse from A to B along the concentration gradient. If an electric gradient is created in opposite direction, the magnitude of the potential that completely counteracts this diffusion (from A to B) is called equilibrium potential. # EMF = +- 61 CA/CB # Where EMF is electromotive force or equilibrium potential in millivolts. o For example, the application of Nernst equation to the concentration of K+ in ICF (150 mEq/L) and in ECF (5 mEq/L) gives a value of - 90 mV. This is called the Nernst potential for K+ (EK).

"A 48 year old male patient comes to the clinic for routine general checkup. He is a known diabetic and is on insulin. On general examination, truncal obesity is seen.
The agent used in the treatment of this patient has all the following actions except:",It inhibits the release of FFA from adipose tissue,It enhances the uptake of glucose into adipose cells via the GLUT4 transporter,"In adipose tissue, it inhibits the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase",Adipose tissue is less sensitive to it than many other tissues,"The rate of release of FFA from adipose tissue is affected by many hormones that influence either the rate of esterification or the rate of lipolysis. Insulin inhibits the release of FFA from adipose tissue, which is followed by a fall in circulating plasma free fatty acids. Insulin also enhances lipogenesis and the synthesis of acyl-glycerol and increases the oxidation of glucose to CO2 via the pentose phosphate pathway. All of these effects are dependent on the presence of glucose and can be explained, to a large extent, on the basis of the ability of insulin to enhance the uptake of glucose into adipose cells via the GLUT-4 transporter.Â 
Another principal action of insulin in adipose tissue is to inhibit the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase, reducing the release not only of FFA, but also of glycerol.Â Adipose tissue is much more sensitive to insulin than many other tissues, which points to adipose tissue as a major site of insulin action in vivo.
Â 
Key Concept:
Adipose tissue is much more sensitive to insulin than many other tissues, which points to adipose tissue as a major site of insulin action in vivo.

Weber-Fechner law is -,Magnitude of sensation is proportional to number of receptor stimulated,Magnitude of sensation is proportional to amplitude of action potential or receptor,Magnitude of sensation is proportional to logarithm of intensity of stimulus,Intensity of frequency of stimulus,"Ans. C. Magnitude of sensation is proportional to logarithm of intensity of stimulusWeber-Fechner Principle--Detection of 'Ratio' of Stimulus Strength. In the mid-1800s, Weber first and Fechner later proposed the principle that gradations of stimulus strength are discriminated approximately in proportion to the logarithm of stimulus strength. That is, a personal ready holding 30 grams' weight in his or her hand can barely detect an additional 1-gram increase in weight. And, when already holding 300 grams, he or she can barely detect a 10-gram increase in weight. Thus, in this instance, the ratio of the change in stimulus strength required for detection remains essentially constant, about 1 to 30, which is what the logarithmic principle means.a. To express this mathematically.b. Interpreted signal strength = Log (Stimulus) + Constantc. More recently, it has become evident that the Weber-Fechner principle is quantitatively accurate only for higher intensities of visual, auditory, and cutaneous sensory experience and applies only poorly to most other types of sensory experience. Yet the Weber-Fechner principle is still a good one to remember, because it emphasizes that the greater the background sensory intensity, the greater an additional change must be for the psyche to detect the change.d. Power Law. Another attempt by physio psychologists to find a good mathematical relation is the following formula, known as the power law.e. Interpreted signal strength = K * (Stimulus - k) yf. In this formula, the exponent y and the constants K and k are different for each type of sensation. When this power law relation is plotted on a graph using double logarithmic coordinates, and when appropriate quantitative values for the constants y, K, and k are found, a linear relation can be attained between interpreted stimulus strength and actual stimulus strength over a large range for almost any type of sensory perception.",C

It consists of a protein opsin and a carotenoid called retinal or retinene (aldehyde of vitamin A). The light absorbed by the rhodopsin conves its 11-cis-retinal into all-trans-retinal. This light-induced isomerization of 11-cis-retinal into all-trans-retinal occurs through formation of many intermediates which exist for a transient period. In the retina, under constant light stimulation, a steady state must exist under which the rate at which they are regenerated.

Most common site of biopsy in amyloidosis,Liver,Spleen,Kidney,Lung,"Ref Robbins 9/e p261 Kidney. Amyloidosis of the kidney is the most common and most serious feature of the disease. Grossly, the kidney may appear unchanged, or it may be abnormally large, pale, gray, and firm; in long-standing cases, the kidney may be reduced in size. Microscopically, the amyloid deposits are found principally in the glomeruli, but they also are present in the interstitial peritubular tissue as well as in the walls of the blood vessels. The glomerulus first develops focal deposits within the mesangial matrix and diffuse or nodular thickenings of the basement membranes of the capillary loops. With progression, the deposition encroaches on the capillary lumina and eventually leads to total obliteration of the vas- cular tuft (Fig. 4-34, A). The interstitial peritubular deposits frequently are associated with the appearance of amorphous pink casts within the tubular lumens, presumably of a pro- teinaceous nature. Amyloid deposits may develop in the walls of blood vessels of all sizes, often causing marked vascular narrowing. renal biopsy is useful in the presence of urinary abnormalities. Rectal and gingival biopsy specimens contain amyloid in as many as 75% of cases with generalized amyloidosis.

Sleep spindles are seen in which stage of sleep -,REM,Stage 1 NREM,Stage 2 NREM,Stage 3 NREM,"Ans is 'c' i.e., Stage 2 NREM Stages of sleepo Sleep is basically divided into two phases :-Non-REM (NREM) or slow-wave sleep It is called Non-REM sleep because no rapid eye movement (REM) is there on eletrooculogram, rather there is slow or quiscent eye movement. It is also referred as S- sleep (synchronized sleep) or quiet sleep or orthodox sleep because there is diminished physiological functions and a low level of overall activity. It is further divided into : -Stage I It is a transition from wakefulness to sleep and is characterized by disappearance of alpha activity and appearance of theta activity. There is slow eye movements.Stage 2 It is characterized by typical EEG activity i.e., Sleep spindles and 'K-complex' .No eye movement occurs.Stage 3 & 4 Stage 3 & 4 are stages of deep sleep. These are also called slow wave sleep as these stages are characterized by slow delta waves. Delta wrave appearance starts in stage 3 and dominated in stage 4.REM sleep The REM sleep is so named as there is rapid roving movements of eye, i.e., rapid eye movement (REM)on electro-oculogram. It is also called paradoxical sleep because there is a paradoxical elevation of brain activity & metabolism and physiological activity. The high-amplitude slow waves seen in stage 3,4 of REM sleep is replaced by rapid lowr voltage activity (Beta wave). Features of REM sleep are:-EEG - Beta-wave, Reappearance of alpha wave. Saw-tooth wave (low voltage fast activity), Ponto-genital-occipital spikes.Dreamingiii) Other features :- Generalized muscular atony. Penile erection, autonomic hyperactivity (Increased pulse rate & BP) and intermittent movement of small muscle groups.o The NREM (with its four stages) and REM sleep repeat several times a night in cyclic manner, 4-6 times depending on the length of sleep. A typical cycle starts with stage 1 of the NREM sleep which is followed by second, third and fourth stages. After this the sleep returns to stage 3 and 2. The first REM sleep occurs now, 70-90 minutes after the the commencement of sleep (Note : - Stage 1 NREM sleep occurs only once at the start of the sleep as this is only a transition phase between wakefulness and sleep. Once the sleep starts the cycle rotates between stage 2, 3, 4 NREM and REM sleep). REM sleep occupies 20-30% of total sleep and NREM sleep occupies 60-70% (Stage-1 - 5-10%; Stage 2 - 40-50%; Stage 3 & 4 - 15-20%).",C

Chlamydia pneumoniae is not identified on the basis of Gram's stain, but rather, can be seen with Giemsa or immunofluorescence. Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative rod. Staphylococcus aureus is also a gram-positive coccus, but the classic description of this organism typically includes a reference to 'grape-like clusters.' Also know: In 2000, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced in which polysaccharide was conjugated with protein. This 7-valent vaccine stimulates T-dependent TH2 responses and is effective beginning at 2 months of age and is thus the standard for childhood immunization. Ref: Ray C.G., Ryan K.J. (2010).

During which phase of cardiac cycle is coronary blood flow maximum?,Isovolumetric contraction,Rapid ejection,Slow ejection,Isovolumetric relaxation,"Coronary blood flow is maximum during the isovolumetric relaxation phase of cardiac cycle. During this phase, coronary flow is maximum because of maximum fall of coronary vascular resistance or due to minimal compression of coronary aery by myocardium during this period. Must know: Variation of Coronary flow with Cardiac cycle: During the phase of isometric ventricular contraction: coronary flow falls sharply and reaches minimum or even falls below the level of zero due to back flow. During the maximum ejection phase: coronary inflow rises sharply due to the sudden rise of aoic pressure. During the reduced ejection phase: coronary inflow again falls below the previous level. This is because, aoic pressure is falling but myocardium is still compressing the coronary vessel. During isovolumetric relaxation: coronary blood flow rises sharply.

All of the following functions are associated with myelination except,Decreases energy expenditure,Increases speed of conduction,Provide protective covering for the axon,Decreases the release of neurotransmitter from the nerve endings,"The main purpose of a myelin layer (or sheath) is to increase the speed at which impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber. Along unmyelinated fibers, impulses move continuously as waves, but, in myelinated fibers, they 'hop' or propagate by saltatory conduction. Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane (the axolemma). Thus, myelination helps prevent the electric current from leaving the axon. It has been suggested that myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication between distant body pas.Myelinated fibers lack voltage-gated ion channels (approximately 25 mm-2) along the myelinated internodes, exposing them only at the nodes of Ranvier. Here, they are found far more abundantly (between 2,000 and 12,000 mm-2). Myelinated fibers succeed in reducing sodium leakage into the extracellular fluid (ECF), maintaining a strong separation of charge between the intracellular fluid (ICF) and the ECF. This increases sodium's ability to travel along the axon more freely. However, the sodium diffuses along the axolemma rapidly but is decremental by nature. The sodium cannot trigger the opening of the voltage-gated sodium channels as it becomes weaker. The nodes of Ranvier, being exposed to the ECF every 1 mm or so, contain large amounts of voltage-gated sodium channels and allow enough sodium into the axon to regenerate the action potential. Each time the action potential reaches a node of Ranvier, it is restored to its original action potential (+35 mV).When a peripheral fiber is severed, the myelin sheath provides a track along which regrowth can occur. However, the myelin layer does not ensure a perfect regeneration of the nerve fiber. Some regenerated nerve fibers do not find the correct muscle fibers, and some damaged motor neurons of the peripheral nervous system die without regrowth. Damage to the myelin sheath and nerve fiber is often associated with increased functional insufficiency.Unmyelinated fibers and myelinated axons of the mammalian central nervous system do not regenerate.Some studies have revealed that optic nerve fibers can be regenerated in postnatal rats. This regeneration depends upon two conditions: axonal die-back has to be prevented with appropriate neurotrophic factors, and neurite growth inhibitory components have to be inactivated. These studies may lead to fuher understanding of nerve fiber regeneration in the central nervous system.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology, 23rd edition, Page no:82",D
Transducin is a protein found in?,Glomerulus,Retina,Skeletal muscle,Adrenal medulla,"ANSWER: (B) RetinaREF: Ganong 22nd edition, chapter 8, http://en.mkipedia.org/uiki/TransducinRepeat from December 2010Repeat (***)'Transducin (also called Gt) is a heterotrimeric G protein that is naturally expressed in vertebrate retina rods and cones'Mechanism of action: Heterotrimeric Transducin (alpha-beta-gamma subunits) is activated by a conformational change in rhodopsin due to the absorption of a photon by rhodopsins active group retinal. Activation causes the GDP bound to the alpha subunit to be exchanged with GTP from solution and results in activated alpha dissociating from beta-gamma. Active Transducin-alpha then causes cyclic GMP Phosphodiesterase to increase its activity, thereby lowering the concentration of cGMP, an intracellular second-messenger molecule. Decrease in cGMP concentration leads to the closure of cGMP-regulated Na+ and Ca2+ ion channels and a hyperpolarized membrane potential. This chain of signaling events is also called 'the vertebrate photo transduction cascade'",B

Which of the following substances would most likely be elevated in this patient's plasma following a fatty meal?,Albumin-bound free fatty acids,Chylomicrons,HDL,LDL,"After eating a high fat meal, triglycerides are processed by the intestinal mucosal cells. They are assembled in chylomicrons and eventually sent into the circulation for delivery to adipocytes and other cells. Chylomicrons are too large to enter cells, but are degraded while in the circulation by lipoprotein lipase. A defect in this enzyme would result in the accumulation of chylomicrons in the plasma. Albumin-bound free fatty acids (choice A) is incorrect because fatty acids leave the intestine esterified as triglycerides in chylomicrons. HDL is not a carrier of dietary fat from the intestine. LDL would be not be elevated in this patient after a high fat meal. However, VLDL would be elevated if the patient ate a high carbohydrate meal. In this situation, the carbohydrate would be conveed into fat in the liver and sent out into circulation as VLDL. VLDL would be unable to be degraded to LDL and, therefore, would accumulate.

Surfactant is produced by: March 2010,Alveolar macrophages,Lymphocytes in the alveoli,Type I alveolar cells,Type II alveolar cells,"Ans. D: Type II alveolar cells The low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence in the fluid lining the alveoli of surfactant, a lipid surface-tension-lowering agent. Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. Surfactant is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells. Typical lamellar bodies, membrane-bound organelles containing whorls of phospholipid, are formed in these cells and secreted into the alveolar lumen by exocytosis. Tubes of lipid called tubular myelin form from the extruded bodies, and the tubular myelin in turn forms the phospholipid film. Some of the protein-lipid complexes in surfactant are taken up by endocytosis in type II alveolar cells and recycled. Surfactant is impoant at bih. The fetus makes respiratory movements in utero, but the lungs remain collapsed until bih. After bih, the infant makes several strong inspiratory movements and the lungs expand. Surfactant keeps them from collapsing again. Surfactant deficiency is an impoant cause of infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS, also known as hyaline membrane disease), the serious pulmonary disease that develops in infants born before their surfactant system is functional. Maturation of surfactant in the lungs is accelerated by glucocoicoid hormones. Fetal and maternal coisol increase near term, and the lungs are rich in glucocoicoid receptors. Patchy atelectasis is also associated with surfactant deficiency in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery involving use of a pump oxygenator and interruption of the pulmonary circulation. In addition, surfactant deficiency may play a role in some of the abnormalities that develop following occlusion of a main bronchus, occlusion of one pulmonary aery, or long-term inhalation of 100% 0,. Cigarette smoking also decreases lung surfactant.",D

Weakest suppo of uterus is?,Broad ligament,Levator ani,Uterosacral ligamnet,Round ligament,"Peritoneal ligaments are mere peritoneal folds which do not provide any suppo to the uterus. 1 The anterior ligament consists of the uterovesical fold of peritoneum. 2 Theposterior ligament consists of the rectovaginal fold of peritoneum . 3 The right and left broad ligaments are folds of peritoneum which attach the uterus to the lateral pelvic wall. When the bladder is full, the ligament has anterior and posterior surfaces, and upper, lower, medial and lateral borders. The upper border is free. The anterior and posterior layers of peritoneum forming the ligament become continuous here. The lateral and inferior borders of the ligament are attached to the corresponding pas of the pelvic wall. The medial border is attached to the lateral margin of the uterus. The ovary is attached to the posterior layer of the broad ligament through themesouarium. The ligament of the ovary passes from the lower pole of the ovary to the lateral angle of the uterus. The pa of the broad ligament lying between the uterine tube and the ligament of ovary is called the mesosalpinx, while the pa below the ligament of ovary is called the mesometrium. The pa of the broad ligament that stretches from the upper pole of the ovary and the infundibulum of the uterine tube to the lateral pelvic wall is called the suspensory ligament of the oaary or the infundibulopelvic ligament .

E coli causing hemolytic uremic syndrome ?,Enteropathogenic,Enterotoxigenic,Enteroinvasive,Enterohemorrhagic,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Enterohemorrhagic SCHERICHIA COLI At least six distinct 'pathotypes' of intestinal pathogenic E. coli exist : Enteropathogenic E. coli lEnteroadherent E. colil It causes diarrhoea in infants and children usually occuring as institutional out breaks. It does not produce enterotoxin, nor are they invasive. They adhere to the mucosa of small intestine and cause disruption of the brush border microvilli. These strains can be identified by their adhesion to HEP - 2 cells. Enterotoxigenic E. coli It causes traveller's diarrhoea [ETEC is the most common cause of traveller's diarrhea!. It produces enterotoxins. They can produce heat labile toxin (LT) or heat stable toxin or both. Toxin production alone may not lead to illness. The strain should first be able to adhere to intestinal mucosa. This adhesiveness is medicated by fimbrial or colonisation factor antigen (CFA). Enteroinvasive E. coli They themselves resemble shigella and their infection resembles shigellosis (remember : shiga like toxin is elaborated by enterohemorrhagic E. coli). They produce mild diarrhoea to frank dysentry and occur in adult as well as in children. They have been termed enteroinvasive because they have the capacity to invade intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and penetrate HeLa or HEP - 2 cells in tissue culture. This ability of penetration is plasmid determined which codes for outer membrane antigens called the 'virulence marker antigen' (VMA). The detection of plasmid can be diagnostic. For laboratory diagnosis of EIEC, the sereny test used to be employed. These strains are non motile, do not ferment lactose or ferment it late with acid without producing any gas. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli or verotoxigenic E. coli These strains produce verocytotoxin (VT) or shiga like toxin (SLT) They can cause mild diarrhoea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis. Shiga like toxin belongs to class ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). It inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomal function. This toxin also acts on vascular endothelium to promote the synthesis of coagulation factor VIII, vWF -* Platelet aggregation. They can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome paicularly in young children and the elderly. 0 157 : H 7 is the most prominent serotype of EHEC, associated with HUS, but 06, 026, 055, 091, 0103, 0111, 0113 and OX3 have also been associated with this syndrome. The primary target for VT is vascular endothelium. The typical EHEC is serotype 0157: H7 which does not ferement sorbital unlike majority of E. coli (but Harrison writes that few species of this serotype can ferment sorbital). Some other serotype like 026 : H1 also belongs to this group. Laboratory diagnosis of VIEC diarrhea is established by demonstration of the bacilli or VT in feces directly or in culture.",D

UAC to UAG-,Nonsense mutation,Frameshift mutation,Deletion,Missense mutation,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Nonsense mutation o Appearance of stop codon (UAG) due to mutation results in premature termination and is called nonsense mutation.Point mutation (Base substitution mutation)o Substitution of a single base by another is known as point mutation. If a purine is replaced by another purine base or if a pyrimidine base is replaced by another pyrimidine base, it is known as transition. Substitution of a purine base by a pyrimidine base or vice versa is known as transversion. A point mutation mil affect only one codon. Point mutation can be of following types >Silent mutationo If the substitution occurs in the third base of a codon, the code word may remain unchanged due to degeneracy of the genetic code. For example, GGC to GGG mutation has no effect as both code for glycine thus, codon containing the changed base codes for the same amino acidQ, therefore there is no change in amino acid sequence of the protein. The gene is expressed in term of same protein, Le. there is no change in expression of proteinQMis-sense mutationso If the base substitution changes the code words, i.e. codon containing the changed base codes for different amino acid(AIIMS-02),it is called mis-sense mutation. The sequence of amino acids in the protein changes. The effect of amino acid substitution is variable :-i) Acceptable missense mutation:- The substitution of amino acid has minimal or no effect because either the substituted amino acid is similar to that of original amino acid or the substitution occurs in non critical area. For example, normally hemoglobin (HbA) has valine at position 67 of b-chain in place of valine. This is non-critical position, i.e. substitution of different amino-acid 'at this position produces normally functional hemoglobin. For example, 'hemoglobin Milwaukee' has glutamic acid at this positionQ (in place of valine), 'hemoglobin bristoF has aspartic acidQ and hemoglobin Sydney' has alnine (in place of valine).Partially acceptable mis-sence mutation:- Substitution of one amino acid with other is partially acceptable, i.e. the resultant protein functions normally under certain conditions but not always. For example, substitution of glutamate by valine at position six of b-chain produces HbS. HbS is able to function normally at high oxygen tension but gets precipitated at low oxygen tension.Unacceptable mis-sense mutation:- Substitution of one amino acid with other produces non-functional protein. For example, in methemoglobin (HbM) histidine is replacement by tyrosine at position 58 of a- chain. HbM is incapable of combining with oxygen.C) Nonsence MutationQo Base substitution changes a sense codon into a nonsense (stop or termination) codon. In such cases, protein synthesis will be terminated prematurely and the resulting protein will be usually non-functional.Frame-shift mutationo Frameshift mutationsQ occur due to insertion or deletion0 of one or two bases which causes change in the reading frame distal to the mutation. If 1 or 2 base pair change, whole reading frame is changed distal to the mutation, resulting into entirely different protein molecule.If 3 base pairs change, single amino acid is incorporated or deleted. The rest of amino acid sequence is same.Trinucleotide repeat mutationQo In this type of mutation a codon (i.e. trinucleotide sequence) undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain. Diseases associated with trinucleotide repeat mutation are Huntington's diseaseQ (CAG repeat), Spinocerebellar ataxiaQ (CAG repeat), friedreich ataxia (GAA repeat), fragile-X-syndrome (GGG or GCC repeat), dystrophia myotonica (CTG/CUG repeat), X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (CAG repeat) and dentorubral pallidoiusian atrophy (CAG repeat).",A
Adult form of Echinococcus is found in:,Dog,Humans,Sheep,Felines,"The adult forms of Echinococcus Granulosus (3 to 6 mm long) resides in the small bowel of the definitive hosts (dog or other canids). Humans are accidental hosts and human echinococcosis (hydatid disease) is caused by the larval stages of Cestodes (tapeworms) of the genus Echinococcus. Adult form of Echinococcus (Adult worm/Mature Cestode) : Lives in the small intestine of the definitive host. Definitive host: Dogs/foxes/other canines.(Dog is the principle definitive host) Embryonated eggs are passed in the feces of Definitive host. Eggs ingested by intermediate host (sheep, cattle, Goat, swine). Intermediate hosts for the parasite, enable the worms to develop, but not to pass infectious eggs. Eggs ingested by Accidental host (humans). Accidental intermediate hosts also enable the worms to develop, but not to pass infectious eggs. They fuher usually represent dead end for the parasite. Egg shell disintegrates (Egg hatches) and each egg released &;an embryo&; called 'Oncosphere' Oncosphere penetrates intestinal wall and enters blood strain where it is distributed to various tissues (Liver/Lung/Brain) Once the Oncosphere arrive in their end organs they gradually develop into fluid filled cysts called Hydatid cysts. Hydatid cysts represent parasitic larval stages in their viscera. The innermost layer of the Hydatid cyst contains germinal membrane from which offsprings will bud. The offsprings are called protoscolices because they contain the hooklets and suckers found in the scolex of adult however, the protoscolices are folded in upon themselves.('invaginated') No fuher development happens in the intermediate hosts.

How many nuclei is present in the mature cyst of E. histolytica?,1,2,4,8,"Mature cyst of Entamoeba histolytica has 4 vesicular nuclei. Such cyst represents the infective form and pass out of the host in feces, after which the glycogen and chromatoidal substance are slowly metabolized and disappear. Initial cyst of E histolytica contains a single nucleus, a glycogen vacuole, and one or more large cigar shaped ribosomal cluster known as chromatoid bodies. Cysts of E.histolytica are highly resistant to desiccation and even to ceain chemicals. Cysts in water can survive for a month while those in feces on dry land can survive for more than 12 days. They tolerate temperatures up to a thermal death point of 50 C, chlorine concentrations normally found in municipal water supplies, and normal levels of gastric acid. Humans are the principal hosts and reservoirs of E histolytica. Transmission from person to person occurs when a parasite passed in the stool of one host is ingested by another.

Which of the following processes is required for HPV to lead to the development of cancer?,Integration of the viral genome,Loss of HPV E6 and E7 genes,Mutation of the virus,Viral replication,"HPVs cause non-genital cutaneous and anogenital or mucosal syndromes. Mucosal and anogenital syndromes include cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer; conjunctival, oral, and laryngeal papillomas, and anogenital warts or condyloma accuminatum. HPV types 16, 18, 31, and 45 are high-risk strains associated with CIN and cancer, although additional types have also been found in such lesions. HPV types 6 and 11 cause the majority of papillomas and condyloma accuminatum. HPV infect the basal keratinocytes of the epithelial layer of skin and mucous membranes. Expression of viral proteins E5, E6, and E7 stimulates cell growth and results in thickening of the layers. As the cells mature, genome replication takes place and mature virions are released at the epithelial surface. The oncogenic mechanism of HPV involves integration of the viral genome (a) into the host chromosome. This results in inactivation of genes required for viral replication (d), which does not occur in these cells, and overexpression of HPV E6 and E7 proteins, which bind p53 and p105RB cellular growth suppressor proteins, a production of a clone of replicating cells with possible progression to neoplasia. Loss of HPV E6 and E7 (b) would forestall oncogenic changes; mutation of the virus (c) is not part of the process.",A

The following substance acts as a 'satiety signal' for lipids,Apo-A,HCL,Fastrine,Enterostatin,"Enterostatin, a peptide that selectively reduces fat intake. It is formed in the intestine by the cleavage of secreted pancreatic procolipase, the remaining colipase serving as an obligatory cofactor for pancreatic lipase during fat digestion. After feeding, enterostatin appears in the lymph and circulation. Enterostatin will selectively inhibit fat intake during normal feeding and in experimental paradigms that involve dietary choice. Both peripheral and central sites of action have been proposed. The peripheral mechanism involves an afferent vagal signaling pathway to hypothalamic centers. The central responses are mediated through a pathway that includes both serotonergic and opioidergic components. Chronically, enterostatin reduces fat intake, body weight, and body fat. This response may involve multiple metabolic effects of enterostatin, which include a reduction of insulin secretion, an increase in sympathetic drive to brown adipose tissue, and the stimulation of adrenal coicosteroid secretionReference: Enterostatin-a peptide regulating fat intake; Erlanson-Albesson C, York D; Obes Res.1997 Jul;5(4):360-72",D

Enzymes stored in muscle is,Alkaline phosphatase,SGOT,SGPT,CPK,"SGOT is normally present in a number of tissues such as hea, liver, muscle, brain, and kidney. It is released into the bloodstream whenever any of these tissues get damaged. For instance, blood AST level is increased in conditions of muscle injury and hea attacks. Hence, it is not highly specific liver tissue damage indicator as it can be elevated in conditions other than liver damage. The aminotransferases catalyze the chemical reactions involving the amino acids, where an amino group is transferred from the donor amino acid to the recipient molecule. Aminotransferases are also referred to as transaminases. Another name for AST is serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Similarly, another name for ALT is serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT). Hence, AST is also referred to as SGOT and ALT is also referred to as SGPT. By contrast, SGPT is normally present in large concentrations in the liver. Hence, due to liver damage, its level in the blood rises, thereby, serving as a specific indicator for liver injury. To regard SGOT and SGPT as liver function tests is a misnomer that is commonly prevalent in the medical community as they do not reflect the functioning of the liver. They only detect any type of liver injury or damage done to the liver due to any type of infection and inflammatory changes. The liver may keep functioning normally even in cases when both of these enzymes are highly raised.",B

All of the following disease show Mitochondrial diseases except,Leigh syndrome,Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy,Myoclonic epilepsy,Huntington's disease,"Huntington&;s disease (HD), also known as Huntington&;s chorea, is an inherited disorder that results in death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can sta at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases sta before the age of 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson&;s disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems. HD is typically inherited from a person&;s parents, with 10% of cases due to a new mutation. The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual&;s two copies of a gene called Huntingtin. This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called 'huntingtin'. Expansion of CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein, which gradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Diagnosis is by genetic testing, which can occur at any point in time, regardless of whether or not symptoms are present. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results.Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington&;s_disease",D
Zymogen activation by partial proteolysis is an example of -,Allosteric modification,Enzyme induction,Enzyme repression,Covalent modification,"Ans. D. Covalent modificationRegulation of Enzyme Activity: -A. Allosteric binding sites: -1. Allosteric enzymes are regulated by molecules called effectors (also called modifiers) that bind noncovalently at a site other than the active site. These enzymes are usually composed of multiple subunits, and the regulatory site that binds the effector may be located on a subunit that is not itself catalytic.2. The presence of an allosteric effector can alter the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, or modify the maximal catalytic activity of the enzyme, or both. Effectors that inhibit enzyme activity are termed negative effectors, whereas those that increase enzyme activity are called positive effectors. Allosteric enzymes frequently catalyze the committed step early in a pathway.3. Homotropic effectors: When the substrate itself serves as an effector, the effect is said to be homotropic. Most often, an allosteric substrate functions as a positive effector. In such a case, the presence of a substrate molecule at one site on the enzyme enhances the catalytic properties of the other substrate-binding sites--that is, their binding sites exhibit cooperativity.4. These enzymes show a sigmoidal curve when reaction velocity (vo) is plotted against substrate concentration (). This contrasts with the hyperbolic curve characteristic of enzymes following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, as previously discussed. Positive and negative effectors of allosteric enzymes can affect either the Vmax or the Km, or both.5. Heterotropic effectors: The effector may be different from the substrate, in which case the effect is said to be heterotropic. The enzyme that converts D to E has an allosteric site that binds the end product, G. If the concentration of G increases (for example, because it is not used as rapidly as it is synthesized), the first irreversible step unique to the pathway is typically inhibited.6. Feedback inhibition provides the cell with a product it needs by regulating the flow of substrate molecules through the pathway that synthesizes that product. Heterotropic effectors are commonly encountered, for example, the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 is allosterically inhibited by citrate, which is not a substrate for the enzyme.B. Regulation of enzymes by covalent modification: -1. Many enzymes may be regulated by covalent modification, most frequently by the addition or removal of phosphate groups from specific serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues of the enzyme. Protein phosphorylation is recognized as one of the primary ways in which cellular processes are regulated.2. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation: Phosphorylation reactions are catalyzed by a family of enzymes called protein kinases that use adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a phosphate donor. Phosphate groups are cleaved from phosphorylated enzymes by the action of phosphoprotein phosphatases.3. For some enzymes, an inactive precursor called a zymogen is cleaved to form the active enzyme. Many proteolytic enzymes (proteases) of the stomach and pancreas are regulated in this way. Chymotrypsin and trypsin are initially synthesized as chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen. Specific cleavage causes conformational changes that expose the enzyme active site.C. Induction and repression of enzyme synthesis: -1. The regulatory mechanisms described above modify the activity of existing enzyme molecules. However, cells can also regulate the amount of enzyme present--usually by altering the rate of enzyme synthesis. The increase (induction) or decrease (repression) of enzyme synthesis leads to an alteration in the total population of active sites. Enzymes subject to regulation of synthesis are often those that are needed at only one stage of development or under selected physiologic conditions.2. For example, elevated levels of insulin as a result of high blood glucose levels cause an increase in the synthesis of key enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. In contrast, enzymes that are in constant use are usually not regulated by altering the rate of enzyme synthesis.3. Alterations in enzyme levels as a result of induction or repression of protein synthesis are slow (hours to days), compared with allosterically regulated changes in enzyme activity, which occur in seconds to minutes.",D

"Respiration stops in the last stage of expiration, in forced expiration b/c of:",Respiratory muscle fatigue,Collapse of alveoli,Dynamic compression of airways,Breaking effect of inspiratory muscles.,"Ans. is 'c' i.e. Dynamic compression of airways. When a forceful expiratory effort is made following changes are seen-In the beginning, when the lung is fully expanded, air flow rate is very high but as the lung volume shrinks (due to continuance of expiration), air flow rate reduces continually.A time, thus comes when despite a maximal expiratory effort, virtually no more air is driven out of the lungs. This volume of lung, at which no air flow from the lung occurs despite effort, is called the closing volume.ReasonA negative intrapleural pressure is required to keep the bronchioles stretched open.As the lung deflates, the intrapleural pressure (Ppl) rises from negative value to 'zero' - this creates a situation when the walls of the bronchioles are no more stretched - bronchodilation ceases - bronchial narrowing - increased air flow resistance - drop of rate of airflow.When the lung volume has sufficiently shrunken, the finest bronchioles are virtually closed - closing volume.",C

"An increase in the concentration of 2-3 Biphosphoglycerate (2, 3 DPG) may be seen in all of the following except.",Anemia,Hypoxia,Inosine,Hvpoxanthine,"D i.e. Hyoxanthine2, 3 Bisphosphoglycerate (2, 3- BPG) or 2, 3 Diphosphoglycerate 2, 3- DPG)It is most abundant organic phosphate in RBC5 where its concentration is approximately that of hemoglobin. It is synthesized from glycolytic intermediates 3-phosplzoglyceraldehyde by means of Rapopo- leubering shunt.It is highly charged anion that binds to the /3 chains of deoxy hemoglobin. One mole of deoxyhemoglobin binds to one mole of 2, 3 BPG. A single molecule of 2, 3 - BPG binds to a positively charged pocket (cavity) formed by two 13-chains, in the centre of deoxyhemoglobin. Positively charged aminoacids of pocket form ionic bonds with negatively charged phosphate group of 2, 3- BPG.It decreases 02 affinity of hemoglobin by binding to deoxyhemoglobin but not to oxyhemoglobin and stabilizing the taut conformation of deoxy hemoglobin.Oxyhemoglobin + 2, 3 - BPG ____________ Deoxyhemoglobin + 02(HbO2) (Hb - 2, 3 - BPG)In this equilibrium, an increase in the concentration of 2, 3 - BPG shifts the reaction to right causing more oxygen to be released.Hemoglobin from which 2, 3 - BPG is removed has a high affinity for oxygen. However, the presence of 2, 3 - BPG significantly reduces the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to right. This reduced affinity enable hemoglobin to releases oxygen efficiently at the paial pressure found in tissues.Role of 2, 3 - BPG in stored & transfused blood: ?Storing blood in acid- citrate - dextrose leads to a decrease of 2, 3- BPG in RBC. Hemoglobin deficient in 2, 3 - BPG displays an abnormally high 02 affinity & fails to unload its bound 02 in tissues properly and thus acts as an oxygen trap rather than as oxygen transpo system. However, transfused RBCs are able to restore their depleted supplies of 2, 3BPG in 24-48 hours; this may be a serius issue in critically ill patiens. This decrease in 2, 3 - BPG can be prevented by adding inosine (hypoxanthine - ribose) to the storage mediumQ. Uncharged inosine molecule enters RBC, releases its ribose moiety, gets phosphorylated and enters HMP pathway to become 2, 3-BPG. Hypoxanthine is formed during utilization of inosine to maintain or increase 2, 3 - BPG content. Thus while inosine increase/ maintain 2, 3 - BPG content, hypoxanthine does notQ.In chronic hypoxia & anemia the concentration of 2, 3- BPG increases whereas, when pH falls (or is low), 2 3- BPG concentration falls because acidosis inhibits red cell glycolysis.Increasing 2, 3 - BPGChronic hypoxia eg- Obstructive pulmonary emphysema- High altitudes- Cyanotic congenital hea diseaseAnemia eg sickle cell HbAcidosis (1- pH)Exercise (in non athletes)Harmones- Thyroid hormone- Growth hormone- AndrogensPregnancyRejuvenating chemical agentsInosineQDihydroxyacetonePyruvatePhosphatePhosphoenol, pyruvate",D

Topographically, it is intimately related to the mandibular nerve, but functionally it is a pa of the glossopharyngeal nerve. The motor or parasympathetic root is formed by the lesser petrosal nerve. The preganglionic fibres are derived from the inferior salivary nucleus - the ninth nerve, its tympanic branch, the tympanic plexus -the lesser petrosal nerve to reach the ganglion. The postganglionic or secretomotor fibres pass through the auriculotemporal nerve to the parotid gland. The sympathetic root is derived from the plexus on the middle meningeal aery.

True about collagen is all Except,Triple helix,Beta pleated sheet,Vit C is necessary for post translational modification,Glycine residue at every third position,"COLLAGENS HAVE A TRIPLE HELIX STRUCTUREAll collagen types have a triple helical structure. A striking characteristic of collagen is the occurrence of glycine residues at every third position of the triple helical poion of the alpha chain. This is necessary because glycine is the only amino acid small enough to be accommodated in the limited space available in the central core of the triple helix.This repeating structure, represented as (Gly-X-Y)n, is an absolute requirement for the formation of the triple helix. While X and Y can be any other amino acids, about 100 of the X positions are proline and about 100 of the Y positions are hydroxyproline. Proline and hydroxyproline confer rigidity on the collagen molecule. Hydroxyproline is formed by the post-translational hydroxylation of peptide-bound proline residues catalyzed by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase, whose cofactors are ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and a-ketoglutarate.Ref: Harper&;s Biochemistry; 30th edition; Chapter 50 The Extracellular Matrix",B

What is the best method for confirming amyloidosis,Colonoscopy,Sigmoidoscopy,Rectal biopsy,Tongue biopsy,"Ref Robbins 9/e p262 Amyloidosis may be an unsuspected finding at autopsy in a patient who has no apparent related clinical manifesta- tions, or it may be responsible for serious clinical dysfunc- tion and even death. The clinical course depends on the paicular sites or organs affected and the severity of the involvement. Nonspecific complaints such as weakness, fatigue, and weight loss are the most common presenting manifestations. Later in the course, amyloidosis tends to manifest in one of several ways: by renal disease, hepato- megaly, splenomegaly, or cardiac abnormalities. Renal involvement giving rise to severe proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) (Chapter 13) often is the major cause of symp- toms in reactive systemic amyloidosis. Progression of the renal disease may lead to renal failure, which is an impor- tant cause of death in amyloidosis. The hepatosplenomeg- aly rarely causes significant clinical dysfunction, but it may be the presenting finding. Cardiac amyloidosis may mani- fest as conduction disturbances or as restrictive cardiomy- opathy (Chapter 10). Cardiac arrhythmias are an impoant cause of death in cardiac amyloidosis. In one large series, 40% of the patients with AL amyloid died of cardiac disease. The diagnosis of amyloidosis may be suspected from the clinical signs and symptoms and from some of the findings mentioned; however, more specific tests must often be done for definitive diagnosis. Biopsy and subsequent Congo red staining is the most impoant tool in the diag- nosis of amyloidosis. In general, biopsy is taken from the organ suspected to be involved. For example, renal biopsy is useful in the presence of urinary abnormalities. Rectal and gingival biopsy specimens contain amyloid in as many as 75% of cases with generalized amyloidosis. Examination of abdominal fat aspirates stained with Congo red is a simple, low-risk method. In suspected cases of AL amyloi- dosis, serum and urinary protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis should be performed. Bone marrow examination in such cases usually shows plasma- cytosis, even if skeletal lesions of multiple myeloma are not present. Proteomic analysis of affected tissue is now being widely used for detection of small amounts of amyloid (from fat aspirates) and for definitive identification of the type of amylo",C

You might have remembered that the virus responsible for croup is the parainfluenza virus. The toughest pa was remembering that parainfluenza virus (along with measles virus, mumps virus, and respiratory syncytial virus) belongs to the paramyxovirus family. These viruses all have negative-strand RNA and an enveloped helical nucleocapsid. The papovaviruses are DNA viruses with a naked icosahedral nucleocapsid. This family includes the human papilloma viruses (which cause was and are associated with penile, laryngeal, and especially, cervical cancer), the BK virus that can affect immunosuppressed patients, the JC virus associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and the simian SV40 virus. The parvoviruses are small, single-stranded DNA viruses. Only one serotype (B19) causes diseases in humans. It causes erythema infectiosum in children (characteristic 'slapped cheek' rash), aplastic crises in patients with hemolytic diseases, and hydrops fetalis or stillbih in anemic fetuses.

Aldosterone acts chiefly on which of the following cells: September 2011,DCT,PCT,Loop of Henle,Glomerulus,"Ans. A: DCT Aldosterone acts on the principal (P) cells of DCT and collecting tubules Aldosterone It increases the reabsorption of sodium ions and water and the secretion of potassium ions in the collecting ducts and distal convoluted tubule of the kidneys' functional unit, the nephron. This increases blood volume and, therefore, increases blood pressure. Drugs that interfere with the secretion or action of aldosterone are in use as antihypeensives. One example is spironolactone, which lowers blood pressure by blocking the aldosterone receptor. Aldosterone is pa of the renin-angiotensin system. Aldosterone is a yellow steroid hormone (mineralocoicoid family) produced by the outer-section (zona glomerulosa) of the adrenal coex. The overall effect of aldosterone is to increase reabsorption of ions and water in the kidney. Its activity is reduced in Addison's disease and increased in Conn's syndrome.",A

Into which of the following spaces is the patient hemorrhaging?,Between the epicardium and the parietal pericardium,Between the parietal pericardium and the fibrous pericardium,Between the fibrous pericardium and the parietal pleura,Between the myocardium and the epicardium,"The pericardial space is located between the epicardium (also known as the visceral pericardium) and the parietal pericardium. A tear of a blood vessel immediately outside of the hea will cause bleeding into the pericardial space. This accumulation of blood in the pericardial space causes increased pressure on the hea, which restricts filling of the hea during diastole (cardiac tamponade). This reduced filling results in reduced cardiac output and reduced blood pressure. The region between the fibrous pericardium and the parietal pleura is outside of the pericardial space. It is pa of the mediastinum and it is in this region in which structures such as the vagus nerve and the phrenic nerve are found.

Peristaltic reflex of the small intestine is controlled by the following:,Vagus nerve,Enteric nervous system,Sympathetic system,Parasympathetic system,"Peristaltic reflex results from localized chemical or mechanical stimulation of the small intestine results in a contraction on the oral side of the stimulus and relaxation on the anal side. These responses are controlled by the enteric nervous system. Sensory neurons that respond to chemicals (eg, acids) or mechanical stimuli (stroking the mucosa or stretch of the muscle with a bolus of digesta) activate excitatory ascending interneurons, which then innervate excitatory motor neurons. These neurons release excitatory neurotransmitters, acetylcholine, and the neuropeptide substance P, which activates receptors on circular muscle cells to trigger contraction. The sensory neurons also excite descending interneurons that innervate inhibitory motor neurons. They, in turn, release inhibitory neurotransmitters, VIP, and nitric oxide, which relax circular muscle. Ref: Mills J.C., Stappenbeck T.S., Bunnett N. (2010). Chapter 13. Gastrointestinal Disease.

Slope of pressure volume curve of lung represents:,Compliance of lung,Conductance,Surface tension,Transpulmonary pressure,"Ans. a (Compliance of lung). (Ref. Ganong Physiology 23rd/ pg. 654-657; Figure 35-10)Lung compliance is an index of lung distensibility or the ease with which the lungs are expanded; thus, compliance is the inverse of elastic recoil. Compliance is defined as the ratio of change of lung volume to the change in pressure required to inflate the lung (dV/dP). Compliance decreases in patients with pulmonary edema or surfactant deficiency and increases when there is a loss of elastic fibers in the lungs, such as occurs in patients with emphysema and with aging.MECHANICS OF BREATHING - Compliance of the lungs & chest wall# Curve of airway pressure plotted against volume, is relaxation pressure curve of the total respiratory system.# The pressure is zero at a lung volume that corresponds to the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of quiet expiration (relaxation volume, which equals the functional residual capacity).# It is positive at greater volumes and negative at smaller volumes. The change in lung volume per unit change in the airway pressure (DV/DP) is the stretchability (compliance) of the lungs and chest wall.Q# It is normally measured in the pressure range where the relaxation pressure curve is steepest, and the normal value is approximately 0.2 L/cm H2O.# The curve is shifted downward and to the right (compliance is decreased) by pulmonary congestion and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis; pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease of unknown cause in which there is stiffening and scarring of the lung.# The curve is shifted upward and to the left (compliance is increased) in emphysema.# It should be noted that compliance is a static measure of lung and chest recoil.# Two major forces contribute to lung compliance:o tissue elastic forces ando surface tension forces.Q",A

Secondary amyloidosis is associated with,A beta,AL,AA,APrP,"Ref Robbins 8/e p252-253,9/e p257 The AA (amyloid-associated) fibril is a unique nonim- munoglobulin protein derived from a larger (12-kDa)serum precursor called SAA (serum amyloid-associated) protein that is synthesized in the liver. SAA is synthesized by liver cells under the influence of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 that are produced during inflammation; thus, long-standing inflammation leads to elevated SAA levels, and ultimately the AA form of amyloid deposits. However, increased production of SAA by itself is not sufficient for the deposition of amyloid. Elevation of serum SAA levels is common to inflammatory states but in most instances does not lead to amyloidosis. There are two possible explanations for this. According to one view, SAA nor- mally is degraded to soluble end products by the action of monocyte-derived enzymes. Conceivably, people who develop amyloidosis have an enzyme defect that results in incomplete breakdown of SAA, thus generating insoluble AA molecules. Alternatively, a genetically determined structural abnormality in the SAA molecule itself renders it resistant to degradation by macrophages",C

Which of the following statement is true regarding binding of O2 to hemoglobin?,Results in a release of the heme from the interior to the exterior of the Beta subunits leading to an increase in O2 affinity of the alpha subunits,Causes a large shift of the surrounding secondary structures which leads to decreased affinity of the deoxy subunits for CO2,"Is Cooperative, meaning that after the first O2 binds, the other subunits are more readily oxygenated",Occurs with equal affinity at all four subunits,"The deoxygenated subunits of the hemoglobin tetramer exist in the T ('tense') conformational state. As erythrocytes enter the capillaries of the lung alveoli, the paial pressure of O2 has increased sufficiently to allow binding to hemoglobin. When one mole of O2 binds, it causes a shift in the overall conformation of the other subunits to a more R ('relaxed') conformational state. This change in conformation leads to higher affinity of the remaining monomers for O2. Each deoxygenated monomer has a progressively increased affinity for O2 as more oxygen binds. This cooperative binding is observed as a sigmoidal curve when plotting the paial pressure of oxygen versus moles of O2 bound. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012).

A genetic defect in which of the following pathway is most likely?",TCA cycle,Uronic acid pathway,Glycolysis,HMP shunt,"Essential PentosuriaÂ defect in Uronic Acid Pathway:

Pentosuria is a condition where the sugar xylitol, a pentose, presents in the urine in unusually high concentrations.
It was characterized as an inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism in 1908. It is associated with a deficiency of L-xylulose reductase, necessary for xylitol metabolism.
L-Xylulose is a reducing sugar, so it may give false diagnosis of diabetes, as it is found in high concentrations in urine.
However, glucose metabolism is normal in people with pentosuriaÂ and they are not diabetic.
Patients of pentosuria have a low concentration of the sugar d-xyloketose. UsingÂ phenyl pentosazone crystals, phloroglucin reaction, and absorption spectrum, pentose can be traced back as the reducing substance in urine, with those that have pentosuria.
