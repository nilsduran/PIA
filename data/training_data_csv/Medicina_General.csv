In anklyosing spondylitis joint involvement is least in?,Wrist and hand,Sacroiliac joint,Acromio-clavicular joint,Costochondral junction,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Wrist and hand Ankylosing spondylitis (marie - strumpell disease) Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton. Prototype of seronegative (absence of rheumatoid factor) spondyloahropathies. Inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. Male to female ratio is 2-3 : 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B27 90-95% of cases are positive for HLA - B27. Joints involved in ankylosing spondylitis Primarily affects axial skeleton. The disease usually begins in the sacro-iliac joints and usually extends upwards to involve the lumbar, thoracic, and often cervical spine In the worst cases the hips or shoulders are also affected. o Hip joint is the most commonly affected peripheral joint. o Rarely knee and ankle are also involved. Pathology Enthesitis i.e. inflammation of the inseion points of tendons, ligaments or joint capsule on bone is one of the hallmarks of this entity of disease. Primarily affects axial (spinal) skeleton and sacroiliitis is often the earliest manifestation of A.S.. Involvement of costoveebral joints frequently occur, leading to diminished chest expansion (normal 5 cm) Peripheral joints e.g. shoulders, and hips are also involved in 1/3rd patients. Extraaicular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis (in 5%); rarely aoic valve disease, carditis and pulmonary fibrosis also occur. Pathological changes proceed in three stages? Inflammation with granulation tissue formation and erosion of adjacent bone. Fibrosis of granulation tissue Ossification of the fibrous tissue, leading to ankylosis of the joint. Inflammatory bowel disease (CD, UC) may also be seen. Clinicalfeatures (symptoms) Low back pain of insidious onset Duration usually less than 3 months Significant morning stiffness and improvement with exercise Limited chest expansion Diffuse tenderness over the spine and sacroiliac joints Loss of lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis Decreased spinal movements (especially extension) in all directions. Radiological features of an kvlasing spondylitis Radiographic evidence of sacroiliac joint is the most consistent finding in ankylosing spondylitis and is crucial for diagnosis. The findings are :- D Sclerosis of the aiculating surfaces of SI joints Widening of the sacroiliac joint space Bony ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints Calcification of the sacroiliac ligament and sacro-tuberous ligaments Evidence of enthesopathy - calcification at the attachment of the muscles, tendons and ligaments, paicularly around the pelvis and around the heel. X-ray of lumbar spine may show :- Li Squaring of veebrae : The normal anterior concavity of the veebral body is lost because of calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament. Loss of the lumbar lordosis. Bridging 'osteophytes' (syndesmophytes) Bamboo spine appearance In the early disease process, plain x-rays may be read as normal. More accurate and early diagnosis can be done by using MR1 and/or CT scan. Dynamic MRI with fat saturation, either sho tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequnece or TI weighted images with contrast enhancement is highly sensitive and specific for identifying early intra-aicular inflammation, cailage changes, and underlying bone marrow edema in sacroilitis. Magnetic resonance imaging allows for visualization of acute sacroilitis, spondylitis, and spondylodiscitis, and can also detect acute inflammation of the entheses, bone and synovium. The ability to detect early inflammatiion and acurately visualize cailaginous and enthesal lesions makes magnetic resonance imaging a useful assessment tool in the spondyloahropathies.",A

WPW syndrome is caused by?,Bundle branch block,Right sided extra fibres,Left bundle branch block,Ectopic pacemaker in atrium,"ANSWER: (B) Right sided extra fibresREF: Harrison s 18th ed ch: 233WPW is caused by the presence of an abnormal accessory electrical conduction pathway between the atria and the ventricles. Electrical signals travelling down this abnormal pathway (known as the bundle of Kent) may stimulate the ventricles to contract prematurely, resulting in a unique type of supraventricular tachycardia referred to as an atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia.The bundle of Kent is an abnormal extra or accessory conduction pathway between the atria and ventricles that is present in a small percentage (between 0.1% and 0.3%) of the general population. This pathway may communicate betrveen the left atrium and the left ventricle, in which case it is termed a 'type A pre-excitation', or between the right atrium and the right ventricle, in which case it is termed a 'type B pre-excitation'. Problems arise when this pathway creates an electrical circuit that bypasses the AV node. The AV node is capable of slowing the rate of conduction of electrical impulses to the ventricles, whereas the bundle of Kent lacks this capability. When an aberrant electrical connection is made via the bundle of Kent, tachydysrhythmias may therefore result.WPW is commonly diagnosed on the basis of the electrocardiogram in an asymptomatic individual. In this case it is manifested as a delta wave, which is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex that is associated with a short PR interval. The short PR interval and slurring of the QRS complex is actually the impulse making it through to the ventricles prematurely (across the accessory pathway) wdthout the usual delay experienced in the AV node.",B

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute cerebral hemorrhage,Acute cerebral infarction,Myocardial infarction,Pulmonary thromboembolism,"Hip fracture and prolonged bed rest are classic risk factors for the development of pulmonary thromboemboli (PE). Common clinical manifestations of PE are hypoxia (due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch) despite a normal chest x-ray, tachycardia, and delirium in older patients. Cerebral hemorrhage might cause delirium but would not directly cause hypoxia unless the patient was hypoventilating (e.g., because of brainstem involvement). Cerebral infarction could produce delirium but would not directly cause hypoxia unless the patient was hypoventilating.

Patients live into adulthood with serum bilirubin levels of 103-428 mmol/L (6-25 mg/dL).In these patients, mutations in the bilirubin UDPGT gene cause the reduction--but not the complete eradication--of the enzyme's activity.

The presentation of the teenager in the question is typical for salicylate poisoning, including poisoning with aspirin. Fatalities are typically due to dehydration and hypokalemia. In contrast to the acute toxicity of salicylates, acetaminophen poisoning produces nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and shock in some cases; it can cause irreversible hepatic failure (which can be prevented or ameliorated by administration of N-acetylcysteine) 2-6 days after ingestion. Carbon monoxide causes hypoxia, and a cherry red coloration of the lips and mucous membranes may be evident. Lead and mercury poisoning are both usually seen in their chronic forms, although mercury ingestion can produce an acute toxicity with renal tubular necrosis and necrosis of gastrointestinal epithelium.

What is the best next step in her management?",Obtain MRI scan of the head,Begin riluzole,Obtain MRI scan of the cervical spine,Check muscle enzymes including creatine kinase and aldolase,"Cervical spondylosis (arthritis) or midline disc protrusion can cause cervical myelopathy, which can mimic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The neck pain and stiffness can be mild. The patient can have both lower motor neuron signs such as atrophy, reflex loss, and even fasciculations in the arms and upper motor neuron signs such as hyperreflexia and clonus (from cord compression) in the legs. Therefore, the diagnosis of ALS is never made without imaging studies of the cervical cord, as compressive cervical myelopathy is a remediable condition. Starting riluzole to slow the progression of ALS would, therefore, be inappropriate at this point. Disease in the cortex would never cause this combination of bilateral upper and lower neuron disease, so an MRI scan of the brain would be superfluous. Myopathies such as polymyositis or metabolic myopathy cause more proximal than distal weakness and would not be associated with hyperreflexia. You should think of disease of the neuromuscular junction (e.g., myasthenia gravis) or muscle when the neurological examination is normal except for weakness. Simply referring the patient for physical or occupational therapy would leave her potentially treatable cervical spine disease undiagnosed. Decompressive surgery can improve symptoms and halt progressive loss of function in cervical myelopathy.",C

It is divided into two types - Direct contact : It involves contact of body surface to body surface with a physical transfer of microorganisms. Hand contact is most common mode of transmission. Indirect contact : It involves body surface contact with a contaminated intermediate object. As hand contact is the most common mode of transmission, the best preventive measure of nosocomial infection is proper hand hygiene. 2) Droplet transmission It occurs when droplet containing microorganisms from an infected person are propelled through the air (e.g. coughing, sneezing) and land on the mouth, eyes or nose of another person. 3) Airborne transmission It results when a droplet containing microorganisms evaporates and remains suspended in air for a long time (this should not be confused with droplet infection, in which transmission is immediate and droplets do not remains suspended in the air). Airborne transmission also occurs by dust paicles containing microorganism. 4) Vehicle transmission It refers to transmission of infection by contaminated items such as food, water, medications, devices and equipment.",C

"Jod basedow phenomenon is seen in all of the following, EXCEPT:",Amiodarone,Iodine containing contrast agents,Iodine in Sea foods,Normal thyroid gland,"Amiodarone can cause thyrotoxicosis by either a Jod-Basedow effect from the iodine load, in the setting of MNG or incipient Graves' disease, or a thyroiditis-like condition. Contrast agents and other iodine-containing substances should be avoided because of the risk of inducing the Jod-Basedow effect, characterized by enhanced thyroid hormone production by autonomous nodules. Usual causes: An iodide load can induce hypehyroidism (Jod-Basedow effect) in some patients with multinodular goiter, latent Graves disease, and rarely in individuals with thyroid glands that appear otherwise normal. Although they appear normal, there is usually an underlying thyroiditis. Jod-Basedow effect does not occur in persons with normal thyroid glands, as thyroid hormone synthesis and release in normal persons is controlled by pituitary TSH secretion, which does not allow hypehyroidism when extra iodine is ingested. Seafoods and seaweed like Kelp has very high Iodine content and can cause Jod-Basedow effect. Ref: Weetman A.P., Jameson J.L. (2012). Chapter 341. Disorders of the Thyroid Gland. In D.L. Longo, A.S.

Of note ,right hea failure need not be present in cor pulmonale . Pathophysiology * Under normal phsyologic conditions. the right ventricle pumps against a low-resistance circuit. * Normal pulmonary vascular resistance is approximately one-tenth the resistance of the systemic aeries. * The right ventricle is thin walled and able to accommodate considerable changes in volume without large changes in pressure. * Increased cardiac output leads to recruitment of underperfused pulmonary vessels and distention of other pulmonary vessels. * The initial pathophysiologic event in the production of co r pulmonale is elevation of the pulmonary vascular resistance. * As the resistance increases. the pulmonary aerial pressure rises. right ventricular work increases. right ventricular hyperophy (i.e.,thickening. dilation. or both ). * Right ventricular failure occurs when compensation through dilation and hyperophy are exhausted. Management * Treat underlying cause -- e.g. COPD and pulmonary infections * Treat respiratory failure -- in the acute situation give 24% oxygen if pa02 <8k Pa .

Administration- intramuscular injection or subcutaneous. Should be refrigerated to ensure no loss of potency. Freezing avoided. Either administered alone or in combination with other vaccine antigens including diphtheria,tetanus,whole cell or acellular peussis,Hepatitis B, or Haemophilus influenza type b. Primary/initial course consists of 4 inoculation: first 3doses given at an interval of 1-2 months and 4 th dose 6-12 months after 3 rd dose. First dose given when the infant is 6 weeks old. Additional doses recommended prior to school entry and then every 5 yrs until the age of 18. Alternatively one/two doses of OPV can be safely given as boosters after an initial course of immunisation with inactivated vaccine. Immunity:- induces circulating humoral antibodies(IgM,IgG,IgA). Doesn&;t induce intestinal or local immunity. The circulating antibodies protect the individual against paralytic polio,but do not prevent reinfection of gut by wild viruses. In case of epidemic, IPV is unsustainable because immunity is not rapidly achieved as more than one dose required to induce immunity and injections are to be avoided during epidemic as they are likely to precipitate paralysis.

Physical examination reveals the presence of a diffuse goiter and exophthalmos. Which of the following laboratory findings would be expected in this individual?",Decreased serum T4,Decreased radioactive iodine uptake,Decreased resin T3 uptake,Increased plasma concentration of thyroglobulin,"The description given above is of an individual with Graves' disease. Hypersecretion of thyroid hormone because of stimulation of the TSH receptor by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins results in excessive movement of thyroglobulin from the colloid to the plasma. The presence of exophthalmos is thought to be pa of the autoimmune disorder in Graves' disease. It is postulated that the thyroid and orbital muscles may share a common antigen. Lymphocytic infiltration and inflammation of orbital muscle then produces the ophthalmopathy. Serum T4 is increased in Graves' disease. Because of excessive stimulation of the thyroid by the thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins, radioactive iodine uptake, which assesses iodine trapping, is increased. The increase in free T4 due to hypersecretion by the thyroid shifts the equilibrium between free and bound T4 toward an increase in thyroxine binding globulin (TBG)-bound hormone. Concomitantly, the concentration of unbound TBG falls. Hence, the radioactive T3 in the resin T3 uptake test would preferentially bind to the resin and resin uptake would be increased.

Which of the following does not affect the Hardy Weinberg principle?,Small population,Random mating,Mutations,Gene outflow,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Random mating Hardy-Weinbergt ,aw of genetic equilibrium The ilardyAN einberg law plays an impoant role in the field ofpopulation genetics and often serves as a basis for genetic inference. o Hardy-Weinberg equation refers to a state in which the allele and the genotype frequencies do not change from one generation to the next in a population. Five conditions are required in order for a population to remain at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium: 1.A large breeding population 2. Random mating 3. No change in allelic frequency due to mutation 4. No immigration or emigration 5.No natural selection So, random mating maintains equilibrium (does not disturb or affect). Non-random mating inluence it.",B

Resistant hypertension when goal is not achieved-,4 drugs + diuretics,2 drugs + diuretics,3 drugs + diuretics,5 drugs + diuretics,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 3 drugs + diuretics o Resistant hypertension is defined in the 2008 American Heart Association guideline as blood pressure that remains above goal in spite ofconcurrent use of''three antihvpertensive agents^ of different classes, one of which should be a diuretic.o Patients whose blood pressure is controlled with 'four or more' medications are considered to have resistant hypertension.Pharmacologic therapyo The pharmacologic treatment of resistant hypertension, by definition, involves combinations of 'three or more ' drugs, including a 'diuretic'.o Three drugs with different mechanism of action should be sequentialy combine:o The triple combination consists ofAn ACE inhibitor or ARBA long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (usually amlodipine), andA long-acting thiazide diuretic (preferably chlorthalidone) well tolerated.o This triple combination is often effective and generally well tolerated. Among patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are already being treated with such a three drug regimen at maximum recommended and tolerated doses, spironolactone is added.o Most patients with resistant hypertension are being treated with a three-drug regimen different from ihe preferred regimen of an angiotensin inhibitor, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and diuretic chlorthalidone; in addition, most who are prescribed four or more antihypertensive drags are not receiving an aldosterone antagonist.Diureticso Persistent volume expansion (typically not sufficient to produce edema) contributes to resistant hypertension, even among patients who have been on conventional doses of thiazide diuretics,o Effective diuretic use is almost always necessary to achieve blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension.o Diuretics should be titrated until the blood pressure goal or the maximum recommended dose (as described below) has been reached or the patient has signs suggestive of overdiuresis such as fatigue, orthostatic hypotension, or decreased tissue perfusion as evidenced by an otherwise unexplained elevation in ihe serumcreatinine concentration. If overdiuresis is suspected, diuretic therapy needs to be reduced.o In those with little renal impairment, chlorthalidone is preferred to hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of resistant hypertension.Aldosterone antagonistso The available aldosterone antagonists, spironolactone and eplerenone, are mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, while potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, amiloride and triamterene) block collecting tubule sodium channels that are normally opened by aldosterone. Spironolactone, eplerenone, and amiloride provide significant antihypertensive benefit when added to existing multiple drug regimens in patients with resistant hypertension.o This should be done in patients with resistant hypertension:o If the patient is on hydrochlorothiazide, switch to chlorthalidone.o If the current regimen includes a drug not from the three recommended drug classes, add the missing preferred drug and assess the response.o If the patient is still hypertensive despite being treated with the three preferred drugs, add an aldosterone antagonist.o If the patient is still hypertensive, additional medications are added sequentially.o Possible agents that may be used includeVasodilating beta blockers (labetalol, carvedilol, or nebivolol)Centrally acting agents (clonidine or guanfacine), andDirect vasodilators (hydralazine or minoxidil).",C

These includea) Sadism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on ones partner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc.b) Lust murder: In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.c) Necrophagia: (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat): This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure.d) Masochism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, tortured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual partner.e) Necrophilia: In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants.f) Fetishism: A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm, eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc.g) Transvestism = Eonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interest, and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality.h) Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these parts with several fingers or whole hands (it is an offence when done in public).i) Exhibitionism (Sec 294IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine).j) Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom: Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman.k) Frotteurism: Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone.l) Undinism: In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex.m) Indecent assault (Sec 354 IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual part of either or is sexually favored. In such assaults, a man may try to kiss a woman, press or fondle with her breasts, touch or expose the genitalia or thighs, try to put a finger in her vagina, play with vulva.# A medical practitioner can be accused of indecent assault if he examines a female patient by stripping her clothes without her consent or even with her consent in the absence of a female attendant.# Such assaults are punishable under Sec 354 IPC, upto 2 years imprisonment and/or fine.n) Uranism: General term for perversion of the sexual instinct.o) Satyriasis: Incessant sexual desire.p) Priapism: Painful penile erection in absence of sexual desire.",B

Most common organ affected in underwater blast ?,Intestine,Liver,Spleen,Hea,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Intestine The most common organ affected in underwater blast injury is intestine. Explosion injury An explosion is a phenomenon resulting from sudden release of energy which is then dissipated by a blast wave, by translocation of objects, or by the generation of heat. Injuries in explosion occur due to four factors :? 1) Blast or shock wave When an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the enviornment in which blast occurs :- Air blast (most common) : Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other pas injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected. Under water blast (explosion under water): Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured. Solid blast : Explosive is detonated near a rigid/solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal; fracture of legs and veebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung. 2) Flame or hot gases Burns or burning of body may occur. 3) Flying missiles (debris) Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations. 4) Anoxia Various gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO,.",A
"In acute intersitial nephritis, proteins associated -",Amyloid,Fibrinogen,Vitamin D binding protein,Albumin,"Acute interstitial nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an immune-mediated disorder, characterised by acute inflammation affecting the tubulo- interstitium of the kidney. It is commonly drug-induced, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) fast becoming the most common cause, but can be caused by other toxins, and can complicate a variety of systemic diseases and infections . Causes Clinical features The clinical presentation is typically with renal impairment but, in some patients with drug-induced AIN, there may be signs of a generalised drug hypersensitivity reaction with fever, rash and eosinophilia. Proteinuria is generally modest (PCR < 100 mg/mmol) and tubular in type . The urine may contain white blood cells and white cell casts but is sterile on culture. Eosinophils are present in up to 70% of patients but this is a non-specific finding. AIN should always be considered in patients with non-oliguric AKI. There may be a rapid deterioration of renal function in some cases of drug-induced AIN, causing the condition to be mistaken for RPGN. Investigations Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis . This typically shows evidence of intense inflammation, with infiltration of the tubules and interstitium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. Eosinophils may also be observed, especially in drug-induced AIN. Often granulomas may be evident, especially in drug-induced AIN or sarcoidosis . The degree of chronic inflammation in a biopsy is a useful predictor of long-term renal function. Eosinophiluria may be present but is not a good discriminator for AIN. Management Some patients with drug-induced AIN recover following withdrawal of the drug alone, but high-dose glucocoicoids (prednisolone1 mg/kg/day) may accelerate recovery and prevent long-term scarring. Other specific causes should be treated, if possible. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 278",A

Severe wasting is -,<60%,<70%,<80%,<90%,"<p> Malnutrition: Defined as a pathological state resulting from a relative or absolute deficiency or excess of one or more essential nutrients. It comprises: Undernutrition, Overnitrition, Imbalance and Specific deficiency. Main victims are children under 15 years. Children under 5 years are hit the hardest. Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition. Waterlow&;s classification of PEM: It defines two groups- 1. Malnutrition with a retarded growth, in which a drop in height/age ratio points to a chronic condition - shoness/stunting. It is an index of duration of malnutrition 2. Malnutrition with a low weight fir a normal height, in ehich the weight for height ratio is indicative of acute condition of rapid weight loss/ wasting . It is an index of severity of malnutrition. Classification of grades of PEM is given by ICMR. IAP Classification of malnutrition: Based on % of ideal weight expected for the age. 1. Normal : >80% 2.

Which is the clinical type of acute pericarditis?,Serous,Fibrinous,Caseous,Purulent,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Fibrinous Classification of pericarditisClinical classificationI. Acute pericarditis (<6 weeks)a) Fibrinousb) Effusive (serous or sanguineous)II. Subacute pericarditis (6 weeks to 6 months)a) Effusinve-constrictiveb) ConstrictiveIII) Chronic pericarditis (> 6 months)a) Constrictiveb) Effusivec) Adhesive (nonconstrictive)* Serous pericarditis is characteristically produced by non- infectious inflammatory diseases, including rheumatic fever, SLE, and scleroderma, as well as tumors and uremia. An infection in the tissues contiguous to the pericardium-- for example, a bacterial pleuritis--may incite sufficient irritation of the parietal pericardial serosa to cause a sterile serous effusion that can progress to serofibrinous pericarditis and ultimately to a frank suppurative reaction.* Fibrinous and serofibrinous pericarditis are the most frequent types ofpericarditis; these are composed of serous fluid variably admixed with a fibrinous exudate. Common causes include acute MI, postinfarction (Dressier) syndrome (an autoimmune response appearing days-weeks after an MI), uremia, chest radiation, rheumatic fever, SLE, and trauma. A fibrinous reaction also follows routine cardiac surgery.* Purulent or suppurative pericarditis reflects an active infection caused by microbial invasion of the pericardial space.* Hemorrhagic pericarditis has an exudate composed of blood mixed with a fibrinous or suppurative effusion; it is most commonly caused by the spread of a malignant neoplasm to the pericardial space.* Caseous pericarditis is, until proved otherwise, tuber- culous in origin; infrequently, fungal infections evoke a similar reaction.",B

"All of the following are seen in Coarctation of Aorta, except-",Diminution of femoral pulsations,High incidence of associated Bicuspid aortic valve,Left ventricular Hypertrophy,Boot Shaped Heart,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Boot Shaped Heart Coarctation of Aorta -o Symptoms of coarctation of Aorta occurs due to decrease in blood supply distal to Aortic obstruction.o Narrowing or constriction of lumen in coarctation of Aorta may occur anywhere along its length but is most common distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery but sometimes it occurs above the origin of the left subclavian artery.o In these cases the blood supply to left arm (supplied by left subclavian) is interrupted whereas blood supply to the right arm is normal. This results in pressure difference between two arms.o The main reason for symptoms in coarctation of Aorta is interruption of blood supply to the organs located distally to obstructiono Very little of the left ventricle output reaches the descending Aorta.o The symptoms are weak pulses and lower blood pressure in the lower extremities associated with manifestations of arterial insufficiency (i.e., claudication and coldness).o Physical examination shows delayed or weak impalpable femorals compared to strong brachial arteries.o Collateral circulation develops between the precoarctation arterial branches and the postcoarctation arteries through enlarged intercostal and internal mammary arteries.o This produces the radiologically visible erosions (notching) of the undersurface of ribs.o Initially when the narrowing is not very severe the blood flowing through the obstruction produces mid systolic murmur passing through the anterior part of chest, back and spinous process, But when the lumen is sufficiently narrowed, the blood flowing across it results in, high velocity jet across the lesion throughout the cardiac cycle resulting in continuous murmur.o Although coarctation of Aorta may occur as solitary defect, it is accompanied by Biscuspid aortic valve in 50% cases. The Biscuspid valve produces Aortic regurgitation and this results in diastolic murmur seen in coarctation of Aorta.o In coarctation of Aorta unless the hypertension is very severe or left ventricular failure has ensued, cardiac output responds normally to exercise.o Coarctation of Aorta is characterized by Hypertension.Pathophysiology of Hypertension in Coarctation of Aorta.o In coarctation of Aorta the narrowing is typically found just after the vessels are given off to the left arm.o This leads to diminished blood supply in organs distal to the narrowing.o There is diminished blood supply to the kidney. So the kidney releases renin to compensate for the diminished blood supply. But the renin release leads to hypertension in organs which originally had normal B.P.o In this way heart and brain are subjected to very high pressures caused due low blood supply to kidney. The hypertension produces headache and dizziness.Treatment of coarctation of Aorta:o Coarctations generally require repair. Dilating the segment with balloons is a possibility, particularly in the young.o Surgical removal of the narrowed segment needs to be accomplished. If allowed to persist, the high blood pressure which is induced may become 'permanent' even after removal of the narrowed segment, due to changes in some organs which are irreversible.o In coarctation of Aorta constriction of the Aorta occurs distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.o So the blood supply of the organs supplied by Aortic segment before the constriction is normal where as the blood supply of the organs supplied by portion of Aorta distal to the constriction is reduced.o This causes marked difference in blood supply between the upper and lower parts of the body.o The pulses and the pressure is greater in upper extremities compared to the pressure and pulses in lower extremities.o On physical examination there is delay in the femoral pulse.o The reduced blood supply in lower extremities produces manifestations of arterial insufficiency i.e., claudication and coldness.Murmur in Coarctation of Aortao The blood passing through the narrowed Aorta produces midsystolic murmur which can be heard over the anterior part of the chest back and spinous process.o When the lumen becomes severely narrowed the blood flow through it, turns in to a high velocity jet which produces continuous systolic murmur.The chest radiographNotching of undersurface of ribso Compensatory collaterals develop between the precoarctation arterial branches and postcoarctation arteries through the enlarged intercostal and internal mammary arteries.o These produces the radiologically visible erosions ('notching') of the undersurface of ribs.'3' Signo The characteristic '3' sign of the coarctation of Aorta is produced due to indentation or constriction of Aorta at the site of coarctation and pre and post stenotic dilatation of Aorta.",D
Which of teh following statements about recommended daily allowance is false -,The RDA is decided by a panel of expes and is based on scientific research,The RDA caters to the dietry requirement of all people,The RDA is often higher than the recommended minimum requirement,The RDA is based on the estimated average requirement (EAR),"BALANCED DIET A diet may be defined as the kinds of food on which a person or group lives. A balanced diet is defined as one which contains a variety of foods in such quantities and propoions that the need for energy, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrate and other nutrients is adequately met for maintaining health, vitality and general well-being and also makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand sho duration of leanness. A balanced diet has become an accepted means to safeguard a population from nutritional deficiencies. In constructing balanced diet, the following principles should be borne in mind : (a) First and foremost, the daily requirement of protein should be met. This amounts to 10-15 per cent of the daily energy intake. (b) Next comes the fat requirement, which should be limited to 15-30 per cent of the daily energy intake (c) Carbohydrates rich in natural fibre should constitute the remaining food energy. The dietary pattern varies widely in different pas of the world. It is generally developed around the kinds of food produced (or impoed) depending upon the climatic conditions of the region, economic capacity, religion, customs, taboos, tastes and habits of the people. It takes into account 95-98% of population. Balanced diets formulated by the Indian Council of Medical researchiis given below A nutritional education guide 'The Food Guide Pyramid' emphasizes foods from the five major food groups shown in the three lower sections of the Pyramid. Each of these food groups provides some, but not all, of the nutrients required. Foods in one group can't replace those in another.

"A 63 year old man presents with a triad of angina, syncope and congestive hea failure. Which of the following valvular hea lesion can be suspected-",antral stenosis,Tricuspid regurgitation,Aoic stenosis,Aoic regurgitation,"Even severe AS may exist for many years without producing any symptoms because of the ability of the hyperophied LV to generate the elevated intraventricular pressures required to maintain a normal stroke volume. Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

Mesothelioma - a form of cancer mainly affecting the mesothelial cells. Asbestos related lung cancer Asbestosis - a non-malignant scarring of the lung tissue a form of pneumoconiasis. Non malignant pleural disease (diffuse pleural thickening and pleural plaques) Pathophysiology: There are 4 principal processes by which asbestos affects the pleura 1. The fibers irritate the pleura, thereby inducing scarring or a more malignant process 2. The fibers may pierce the mitotic spindle of cells, thereby disrupting mitosis leading to chromosomal damage 3. They also induce the generation of iron-related reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing DNA damage 4.

A: Per capita The Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) is an attempt to measure the quality of life or well-being of a country. The value is the average of three statistics, all equally weighted on a 0 to 100 scale: Basic literacy rate, Infant moality, and Life expectancy at age one, It was developed for the Overseas Development Council in the mid-1970s by Morris David Morris, as one of a number of measures created due to dissatisfaction with the use of GNP as an indicator of development. This shows that money is not everything. PQLI might be regarded as an improvement but shares the general problems of measuring quality of life in a quantitative way. It has also been criticized because there is considerable overlap between infant moality and life expectancy. Steps to Calculate Physical Quality of Life: Find percentage of the population that is literate (literacy rate). Find the infant moality rate.

This is due to the unopposed action of the genioglossus muscle on the normally innervated side of the tongue (the genioglossus pulls the tongue forward).The corticobulbar input to the hypoglossal nucleus arises from motor cortex and is predominantly CROSSED. Thus, a lesion in motor cortex will result in deviation of the tongue toward the opposite side or CONTRALATERAL to the lesion. In contrast to the atrophy and fasciculations seen in lesions of the hypoglossal nucleus and nerve (lower motor neuron), NO such signs are present after lesions of the corticobulbar tract.",B

Pseudomyxoma peritonie is seen with -,Thecoma ovary,Mucin secreting ovarian carcinoma,Carcinoid appendix,Mesothelioma,"Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a clinical condition caused by cancerous cells (mucinous adenocarcinoma) that produce abundant mucin or gelatinous ascites.The tumors cause fibrosis of tissues and impede digestion or organ function, and if left untreated, the tumors and mucin they produce will fill the abdominal cavity. This will result in compression of organs and will destroy the function of colon, small intestine, stomach, or other organs. Prognosis with treatment in many cases is optimistic,but the disease is lethal if untreated, with death by cachexia, bowel obstruction, or other types of complications This disease is most commonly caused by an appendiceal primary cancer (cancer of the appendix); mucinous tumors of the ovary have also been implicated, although in most cases ovarian involvement is ored to be a metastasis from an appendiceal or other gastrointestinal source. Disease is typically classified as low- or high-grade (with signet ring cells). When disease presents with low-grade histologic features the cancer rarely spreads through the lymphatic system or through the bloodstream The primary tumor appears to arise from the MUC2 expressing goblet cells and most commonly from these cells in the appendix. The K-Ras and p53 genes may be involved in the oncogenesis. It may be diagnosed with a range of conditions. While the majority of these cases are associated with appendiceal carcinomas,other conditions may also be found, including disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM), peritoneal carcinomas, several mucinous tumors (mucinous adenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenoma, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma), as well as other disease states.Other primary sites that have been repoed include colon, rectum, stomach, gallbladder, bile ducts, small intestine, urinary bladder, lung, breast, fallopian tubes, and the pancreas Ref Davidson edition23rd pg826",B

"A female aged 30, presents with episodic throbbing headache for past 4 yrs. It usually involves one half of the face and is associated with nausea and vomiting. There is no aura. Most likely diagnosis is:",Migraine,Cluster headache,Angle closure glaucoma,Temporal aeritis,"Answer is A (Migraine): Episodic unilateral throbbing headache in a 30 year old female with associated nausea and vomiting suggests a diagnosis of migraine. Aura may or may not be present. Infact 80% of patients with migraine have migraine without aura and 15-20% have migraine with aura. Common Migraine (Migraine without aura) This is characterized by headache with autonomic system dysfunction ( eg. pallor & nausea, vomiting), but without stereotypical neurological or ophthalmic features as in classical migraine Premonitory features include changes in mood frequent yawning or nonspecific prodromal symptoms like loss of concentration Headache stas anywhere in the cranium and is pounding or throbbing It usually spreads to involve one half or even the whole head. During the attack which lasts from hours to a day or more patient is frequently photophobia and phonophobic and seeks relief in quiet dark environment, or through sleep. Classical Migraine (Migraine with aura) This is characterized by headache heralded by a visual aura which lasts about 20 minutes. Visual aura may consist of bright or dark spots, zig zags, heat haze distoions, fig san puzzle defects scintillating scotoma, tunnel vision or foification spectra which may progress to homonymous hemianopia.

Adipocere formation is seen in?,Dead body exposed to air,"Dead body buried in damp, clay soil",Burial dry hot air,All of the above,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Dead body buried in damp, clay soil Adipocere formation (saponification)o Adipocere is a modification ofputrefaction, which occurs in the absence of air. That is when there is excessive moisture (humidity) and warnth (warm temperature), but absence of air i.e. warm humid climate, normal putrefaction does not occur, rather saponification occurs.o Thus adipocese formation occurs in dead bodies which are lying in water (immered in water) or hurried in damp lay soil.o Saponification (adipocer formation) is the conversion of dead body into soft, fatty waxy substance due to conversion of unsaturated liquid fats to saturated solid fats under the influence of intrinsic lipase and lecithinase produced by Cl. perfringens. The process involves gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of body fats into higher fatty acids which combine with calcium and ammonium ions to form insoluble soaps. Ultimately, palmitic, oleic, stearic and hydroxystearic acids are formed, mixture of these is known as adipocere.o Adipocere formation starts in subcutaneous fat and is marked in areas having excessive fat, eg. cheeks, female breast, buttocks and abdomen. Slowly the whole body including muscles and internal viscera change into adipocere. Adipocere has offensive or sweetish smell, however in early stages, smell is ammonical.o Body is converted into soft, waxy and brittle substance, it floats on water, it can be cut easily, it dissolves in alcohol and ethers, and it melts on heating. Facial features and injuries on body are well preserved, thus identfication of body and determination cause of death (in case of injury) are possible.o Normally adipocere formation requires 3 weeks to upto 3 to 6 months. However shortest recorded period in india is 3 days 22 hours. In india, it has been observed to begin within 4-5 days. Adipocere may persist for years or decades. Adipocere does not occur in foetus less than 7 months.o Medicolegal importance : (i) Identification of body (facial features are preserved), (ii) cause of death (injury marks are preserved), (iii) time since death can be estimated.",B

Kussmaul's sign is NOT seen in: March 2011,Constrictive pericarditis,Right Ventricular Infarct,Restrictive Cardiomyopathy,Cardiac tamponade,"Ans. D: Cardiac tamponade A positive Kussmaul sign is rare in cardiac tamponade Davidson's (21st ed., p-542) includes Kussmaul's sign as a clinical feature of pericardial/ cardiac tamponade Normal physiology: Ordinarily the JVP falls with inspiration due to reduced pressure in the expanding thoracic cavity. Kussmaul's sign suggests impaired filling of the right ventricle due to either fluid in the pericardial space or a poorly compliant myocardium or pericardium. This impaired filling causes the increased blood flow to back up into the venous system, causing the jugular distension. Causes of Kussmaul's sign: The differential diagnosis generally associated with Kussmaul's sign is constrictive pericarditis, along with restrictive cardiomyopathy and cardiac tamponade. With cardiac tamponade, jugular veins are distended and typically show a prominent x descent and an absent y descent as opposed to patients with constrictive pericarditis Right ventricular infarction - low ventricular compliance Right hea failure Cardiac tumours Tricuspid stenosis",D

Reflux disease which cause proteinuria of nephrotic range-,Membranous glomerulonephritis,Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,Nodular glomerulosclerrosis,Crescenteric glomerulonephritis,"Focal Segmental glomerulosclerosis is a type of glomerular disease and describes scarring (sclerosis) in your kidney. The scarring of FSGS only takes place in small sections of each glomerulus (filter), and only a limited number of glomeruli are damaged at first Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can occur in all age groups but is paicularly common in people of West African descent, who, compared with other ethnicities, have a much higher carriage rate of an apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene variant that is associated with increased risk of FSGS. Histological analysis shows sclerosis initially limited to segments of the glomeruli, which may also show positive staining for deposits of C3 and IgM on immunofluorescence. Since FSGS is a focal process, abnormal glomeruli may not be seen on renal biopsy if only a few are sampled, leading to an initial diagnosis of minimal change nephropathy. In most cases the underlying cause is unknown (primary FSGS) and these patients typically present with abrupt onset of severe nephrotic syndrome. Primary FSGS may respond to high-dose glucocoicoid therapy (0.5-2.0 mg/ kg/day) but the response is rarely as rapid or complete as for minimal change disease. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, have also been used but their efficacy is unceain. Progression to CKD is common in patients who do not respond to glucocoicoids and the disease frequently recurs after renal transplantation. FSGS may also be secondary to other diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) renal disease (paicularly in African Americans), morbid obesity or chronic hypeension. In addition, it may reflect scarring from previous focal glomerular injury resulting from HUS, cholesterol embolism or vasculitis. Patients with secondary FSGS typically present with more modest proteinuria than those with primary disease and rarely exhibit full-blown nephrotic syndrome. Management of secondary FSGS is focused on treating the underlying cause and reducing proteinuria by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system . Ref Harrison20th edition pg 277",B

Direct standardization is used to compare the mortality rates between two countries. This is done because of the difference in-,Causes of death,Numerators,Age distributions,Denominators,"Adjusted or standardized rates

Standardization (or adjustment) of rates is used to unable the valid comparison of groups that differ regarding an important health determinant (most commonly age).
For example, if we want to compare the death rates of two different populations with different age composition, the crude death rate is not right yardstick because rates are only comparable if the populations upon which they are based are comparable.
To remove this confounding effect of different age structure, adjustment or standardization is done.
Two major approaches to standardization have been used :-

Pulse deficit of more than 10 per minute is seen in:,Ventricular Premature Contraction (VPC) (NBE),Bradyarrhythmias,Atrial Fibrillation (AF),Ventricular Fibrillation (VF),Answer is C (Atrial Fibrillation) Atrial Fibrillation is the most common cause of Pulse Deficit and the pulse deficit is often more than 10 per minute. Pulse deficit refers to the difference between the radial pulse rate and the hea rate counted by auscultation (Apical Ventricular Rate). Pulse deficit is produced when ventricular contractions are preceded by sho diastoles such that poor ventricular filling results in insufficient stroke volume to transmit the pressure wave out to the radial pulse. The radial pulse rate is always lower than the ventricular pulse rate. The most common cause ofpulse deficit is atrial fibrillationand pulse deficit has traditionally been believed to be a classical bedside sign for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Pulse deficit may however be produced by any tachyarrhythmia (fast hea rate) or Extra-systoles (Premature Ventricular Contractions). Typically Pulse deficits generated by Multifocal PVC or PAC are small (<10/min) while those generated by Atrial Fibrillation are larger (>10/ min). Pulse deficits of more than 10 per minute are frequent in Atrial Fibrillation with a fast hea rate.

It is characterised by decrease in cardiac output and loss of consciousness due to a transient arrhythmia; for example, bradycardia due to complete hea block The attacks are caused by any temporary lack of cardiac output. This in turn could be due to any number of causes, including antimony poisoning, cardiac asystole, hea block, Lev's disease or ventricular fibrillation. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation is the underlying cause in up to 5% of patients. The resulting lack of blood flow to the brain is responsible for the faint Stokes-Adams attacks may be diagnosed from the history, with paleness prior to the attack and flushing after it paicularly characteristic.

Acrodynia/Pink disease occurs in poisoning with,Mercury,Lead,Arsenic,Thallium,"MERCURY (QUICKSILVER) Chronic Poisoning (Hydrargyrism):- This may result from (1) continuous accidental absorption (2) excessive therapeutic use, (3) fromrecovery from a large dose, and ( 4) if ointment is used as external application for a long time. Chronic exposure leads to classic triad of gingivitis and salivation, tremors and neuropsychiatric changes. The symptoms are salivation, inflammation of gums and occasionally a blue line at their junction with teeth, sore mouth and throat, loosening of teeth , gastrointestinal disturbances, anaemia, anorexia, loss of weight and chronic inflammation of kidneys with progressive uraemia. Tremors (sometimes called Danbury tremors):- occur first in the hands, then progress to lips and tongue and finally involve arms and leg. The advanced condition is called hatter&;s shakes or* glass-blower&;s shakes, because they are common in persons working in glass-blowing and hat industries. The patient then becomes unable to dress himself. write legibly or walk Properly. The most severe form is known as concussio mercurialis, in which no activity is possible. Mercurial erethism:- is seen in persons working with mercury in minor manufacturing firms. This term is used to refer to the psychological effects of mercury toxicity. These include anxiety, depression, shyness, timidity, irritability, loss of confidence, mental depression, delusions and hallucinations, or suicidal melancholia, or manic depressive psychosis (mad hatter), emotional instability, loss of memory and insomnia. Mercurialentis:- is a peculiar eye change due to exposure to the vapour of mercury. It is due to brownish deposit of mercury through the cornea on the anterior lens capsule. Slit-lamp examination demonstrates a malt-brown reflex from the anterior lens capsule. It is bilateral and has no effect on visual acuity. Renal damage results in membranous glomerulonephritis with hyaline casts and fatty casts in the urine. Kidney is the primary target. Acrodynia or pink disease :- (because it is characterised by a generalised body rash) is thought to be an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction paicularly seen in children. This can be caused by Chronic mercury exposure in any form. The onset is insidious with anorexia, insomnia, sweating, skin Rash and photophobia.

In PNH, there is loss of hemoglobin and iron in urine - the negative iron deficit leading to iron deficiency anemia. The hypercoagulable state in PNH leads to Budd Chiari syndrome and this disorder, being an acquired stem cell defect can lead to aplastic anemia. The clinical syndrome can present with 3 types of symptoms including: (1) an acquired intracorpuscular hemolytic anemia due to the abnormal susceptibility of the RBC membrane to the hemolytic activity of complement; (2) thrombosis in large vessels, such as hepatic, abdominal, cerebral, and subdermal veins; and (3) a deficiency in hematopoiesis that may be mild or severe, such as pancytopenia in an aplastic anemia state. Flow cytometry is used to detect CD59 (MIRL), a glycoprotein, and CD55 (DAF) in regulation of complement action. Absence or reduced expression of both CD59 and CD55 on PNH RBCs is diagnostic. The Ham test (acidified serum lysis) establishes the diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), demonstrating a characteristic abnormality of PNH red blood cells by acidified fresh normal serum.

"In Addison's disease, the most diagnostic test is -","Serum Na+,K+ renin","S. Na+,K+, saline suppression",Serum creatinine/urea ratio,ACTH stimulation test,"The best method used for diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is ACTH stimulation test.

Addison's disease is produced due to deficiency of serum cortisol, but the measurement of these hormones is not the best way to diagnose addison's disease.
Addison's disease is best diagnosed by ACTH stimulation test.


The ACTH stimulation test detects the adrenal deficiency at very early stage of addisons disease when serum cortisol levels are normal.
During the early phase of addison's disease, the serum cortisol levels are normal, but the adrenal reserve is decreased.
During these phases the adrenal deficiency is precipitated by stress.
ACTH stimulation can expose the cortisol deficiency even at these stages

 'Upon ACTH stimulation the increase in cortisol level is less than normal.'

ACTH stimulation test is performed by assessing cortisol response upon administering 250 IV of consyntopin  i.v. or i.m. 
The criteria for normal response is serum cortisol level >500 nmol/l (>18 µg/d1).
If the response is subnormal addison's disease is diagnosed.
To further differentiate between primary and secondary addison's disease, serum aldosterone level is measured from the same serum sample.

Which is not a feature of cocaine poisoning: September 2011,Hallucination,Agitation,Hypothermia,Stimulation of libido,"Ans. C: Hypothermia Cocaine when ingested results in hypehermia, hallucinations, euphoria and stimulation of libido Cocaine intoxication With excessive or prolonged use, the drug can cause itching, tachcardia, hallucinations and paranoid delusions. Overdoses cause tachyarrythmias and a marked elevation of blood pressure, which can be life-threatening. Toxicity results in seizures, followed by respiratory and circulatory depression of medullar origin. This may lead to death from respiratory failure, stroke, or hea-failure. Cocaine is also highly pyrogenic, because the stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production. Heat loss is inhibited by the intense vasoconstriction. Cocaine-induced hypehermia may cause muscle cell destruction and myoglobinuria resulting in renal failure. Emergency treatment often consists of administering a benzodiazepine sedation agent, such as diazepam to decrease the elevated hea rate and blood pressure. Physical cooling (ice, cold blankets, etc.) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used to treat hypehermia There is no officially approved specific antodote for cocaine overdose Cocaine's primary acute effect on brain chemistry is to raise the amount of dopamine and serotonin in the nucleus accumbens (the pleasure center in the brain); this effect ceases, due to metabolism of cocaine to inactive compounds and paicularly due to the depletion of the transmitter resources (tachyplaxis). This can be experienced acutely as feelings of depression, as a 'crash' after the initial high.",C

Transmission of microfilaria in mosquito is ?,Cyclo-developmental,Cyclo-propagative,Propagative,Cyclical,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Cyclodevelopmental In vector born diseases, an ahropod or any living carrier (e.g., snail) acts as a vector and transpos an infectious agent to a susceptible individual. Transmission by a vector may be of following types : ? A. Mechanical transmission The infectious agent is mechanically transpoed by vector, e.g., through souling of feet of flying ahropod. There is no development or multiplication of infectious agent within the vector. B. Biological transmission The infectious agent undergoes replication (change in number) or development (change in form) or both in vector. So, inectious agent requires an incubation period (extrinsic incubation period) before vector can transmit it to host. This type of transmission is of three types : - i) Propagative Agent undergoes multiplication (change in number) in the vector. There is no development - No change in form. Example - Plague bacilli in rate fleas. ii) Cyclo-developmental Agent undergoes only development - Change in form. No multiplication - No change in number. Example - Micorfilaria in mosquito. iii) Cyclo-propagative Agent undergoes both development and multiplication - Change in form and number. Example - Malaria parasite (plasmodium sp.) in mosquito.",A

All of the following are true about Raynaud's disease except,More common in females,Positive antinuclear antibodies,Most common cause of raynaud's phenomenon,Has good prognosis,"Raynaud's disease is a rare disorder of the blood vessels, usually in the fingers and toes.

When the blood flow returns, the skin turns red and throbs or tingles. In severe cases, loss of blood flow can cause sores or tissue death. Primary Raynaud's happens on its own. The cause is not known. There is also secondary Raynaud's, which is caused by injuries, other diseases, or ceain medicines. People in colder climates are more likely to develop Raynaud's.

'Teichopsia' is seen in,Age Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD),Migraine,Vitreous hemorrhage,Optic atrophy,"Ans. B. Migrane. (Ref Victor Adams Neurology, pg. 182-183.)Classic migraine is usually familial, involves a unilateral, throbbing head pain, and diminishes in fre- quency with age. The blind spot, or scotoma, that may develop as part of the aura of a classic migraine attack will involve the same visual field in both eyes. This defect usually changes over the course of minutes. It typically enlarges and may intrude on the central vision. The margin of the blind spot is often scintillating or dazzling. If this margin has a pattern like the battlement of a castle, it is called a fortification spectrum, or teichopsia. Homonymous hemianoptic defects of the sort that develop during the aura of a classic migraine indicate an irritative lesion that is affecting one part of the occipital cortex in one hemisphere of the brain. The changes in the scotoma over the course of minutes indicate that the irritative phenomenon sets off a cascade of events in the visual cortex that temporarily disturbs vision in a progressively larger area. Other focal neurologic phenomena may precede classic migraine; the most common are tingling of the face or hand, mild confusion, transient hemiparesis, and ataxia. Fatigue, irritability, and easy distractibility often develop before a migraine. Affected persons usually also have hypersensitivity to light and noise during an attack.",B

Newer Influenza vaccine -a)  Split-virus vaccineb)  Neuraminidase c)  Live attennuated vaccined) Killed vaccine,ac,a,ad,ab,"Prevention of influenza 
1. Immunization
Three types of vaccines are available :
a) Killed vaccine - most commonly used                        
b) Live attenuated - Administered as nasal drops
c) Newer vaccines - Split virus vaccine (sub-virion vaccine)

Used subcutaneously


Recombinant vaccine
Neuraminidase vaccine


A trivalent, live attenuated influenza vaccine administered as a single dose intranasal spray is a effective as inactivated vaccine. It is approved for use in otherwise healthy individuals between the age of 2 years and 49 years.

2. Chemoprophylaxis

Type A → Amantadine and rimantidine
Both Type A & B → Zamamivir, Osteltamivir
The current recommendations are that influenza A be treated with zanamivir or a combination of oseltamivir and rimantadine. Influenza B can be treated with either oseltamivir or zanamivir.
For chemoprophylaxis against influenza A, Zanamivir should be used. If this is contraindicated, rimantidine should be given. For influenza B, oseltomivir is used.

Following information has been added in 22nd /e of Park


Oseltamivir is the drug of choice for chemoprophylaxis of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 for health care personnel’s and close contacts of suspected, probable or confirmed case of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009.",D

Which of the following conditions is he most likely at risk of developing?",Mallory-Weiss syndrome,Peptic ulcer disease,Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus,Rupture of esophageal varies,"Clinical features of Squamous carcinoma of oesophagus Most patients have a history of progressive, painless dysphagia for solid foods. Others present acutely because of food bolus obstruction. In the late stages, weight loss is often extreme; chest pain or hoarseness suggests mediastinal invasion. Fistulation between the oesophagus and the trachea or bronchial tree leads to coughing after swallowing, pneumonia and pleural effusion. Physical signs may be absent but, even at initial presentation,cachexia, cervical lymphadenopathy or other evidence ofmetastatic spread is common. Investigations The investigation of choice is upper gastrointestinal endoscopywith biopsy. A barium swallow demonstrates the site and length of the stricture but adds little useful information. Once a diagnosis has been made, investigations should be performed to stage the tumour and define operability. Thoracic and abdominal CT, often combined with positron emission tomography (PET-CT), should be carried out to identify metastatic spread and local invasion . Invasion of the aoa, major airways or coeliac axis usually precludes surgery, but patients with resectable disease on imaging should undergo EUS to determine the depth of penetration of the tumour into the oesophageal wall and to detect locoregional lymph node involvement .

All are true about Hashimoto thyroiditis Except,Myoclonus,Seizures,Steroid responsive encephalopathy,EEG is normal,"Clinical Manifestations of Hashimoto's thyroiditis Patients with atrophic thyroiditis or the later stage of Hashimoto's thyroiditis present with symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. The skin is dry, and there is decreased sweating, thinning of the epidermis, and hyperkeratosis of the stratum corneum. Increased dermal glycosaminoglycan content traps water, giving rise to skin thickening without pitting (myxedema). Typical features include a puffy face with edematous eyelids and nonpitting pretibial edema Other common features include constipation and weight gain (despite a poor appetite). In contrast to popular perception, the weight gain is usually modest and due mainly to fluid retention in the myxedematous tissues. Libido is decreased in both sexes, and there may be oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in long-standing disease, but menorrhagia may occur at an early stage. Feility is reduced, and the incidence of miscarriage is increased. Carpal tunnel and other entrapment syndromes are common, as is impairment of muscle function with stiffness, cramps, and pain. On examination, there may be slow relaxation of tendon reflexes and pseudomyotonia. Memory and concentration are impaired. Experimentally, positron emission tomography (PET) scans examining glucose metabolism in hypothyroid subjects show lower regional activity in the amygdala, hippocampus, and perigenual anterior cingulated coex, among other regions, and this activity corrects after thyroxine replacement. Rare neurologic problems include reversible cerebellar ataxia, dementia, psychosis, and myxedema coma. Hashimoto's encephalopathy has been defined as a steroid-responsive syndrome associated with TPO antibodies, myoclonus, and slow-wave activity on electroencephalography, but the relationship with thyroid autoimmunity or hypothyroidism is not established .

All are true about emphysema except:,Cyanosis,Barrel-shaped chest,Associated with smoking,Type 1 respiratory failure,"OPTION A) CLINICAL FEATURE OF EMPHYSEMA SYMPTOMS; The three most common symptoms in COPD are cough, sputum production, and exeional dyspnea. Activities involving significant arm work, paicularly at or above shoulder level, are paicularly difficult for many patients with COPD . the principal feature is worsening dyspnea on exeion with increasing intrusion on the ability to perform vocational or avocational activities. In the most advanced stages- patients are breathless doing simple activities of daily living. CLINICAL FEATURE OF COPD - EMPHYSEMA The classic presentation of emphysema with no 'bronchitic' component. Patients barrel-chested and dyspneic, with prolonged expiration, sitting forward in a hunched-over position. In these patients, air space enlargement is severe and diffusing capacity is low. Dyspnea and hyperventilation are prominent, so that until very late in the disease, gas exchange is adequate and blood gas values are relatively normal. Because of prominent dyspnea and adequate oxygenation of hemoglobin, these patients sometimes are sometimes called 'pink puffers.' CHRONIC BRONCHITIS -emphysema with pronounced chronic bronchitis and a history of recurrent infections. Dyspnea usually is less prominent, and in the absence of increased respiratory drive the patient retains carbon dioxide, becoming hypoxic and often cyanotic .such patients tend to be obese--hence the designation 'blue bloaters.' OPTION 2) ON PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Early stages of COPD, patients usually have an entirely normal physical examination. More severe disease, the physical examination - prolonged expiratory phase and may include expiratory wheezing. Signs of hyperinflation 1) barrel chest and enlarged lung volumes with poor diaphragmatic excursion as assessed by percussion. 2)Patients with severe airflow obstruction -use of accessory muscles of respiration, sitting in the characteristic 'tripod' position to facilitate the actions of the sternocleidomastoid, scalene, and intercostal muscles. 3 CYANOSIS if emphysema with chronic bronchitis Patients may develop cyanosis, visible in the lips and nail beds. 4) SIGN OF ADVANCED COPD cachexia ,significant weight loss, bitemporal wasting, anddiffuse loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue.

The kidneys are enlarged, but the spleen and heart are of normal size. The hepatocytes are dis- tended by glycogen and fat with large and prominent lipid vacuoles. Despite hepatomegaly, liver enzymes are usually normal or near normal.* Easy bruising and epistaxis are associated with a prolonged bleeding time as a result of impaired platelet aggregation/adhesion.* Hyperuricemia is present.* Hyperlipidemia includes elevation of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids.* Type Ib patients have additional findings of neutropenia and impaired neutrophil function, resulting in recurrent bacterial infections and oral and intestinal mucosal ulceration.* GSD I patients may experience intermittent diarrhea, which can worsen with age.

However, sometime such continuty of events is broken by an entirely new and unexpected happening, due to negligence of some other person, i.e. 'novus actus intervenien' (an unrelated action intervening).# For example, If a person has been assaulted due to which he has sustained large liver laceration, for which he is operated by a surgeon. If the patient dies intraoperatively or postopratively due to complications related to surgery or injury, the person who has assaulted the patient will be held responsible. But, if the doctor has done some negligent act during surgery, e.g. left the swab or instrument in abdomen during surgery; and patient dies because of that act (sepsis due to swab), then the resposibility may pass from original incident to later negligent act of doctor by principle of 4novus actus intervention' (an unrelated action intervening). Thus doctor is responsible for negligent act, i.e. criminal negligence, and the assailant will not be fully responsible for the ultimate harm.7) Contributory negligence:# It is defined as concurrent or simultaneous negligence of doctor and patient so as to lead to damage to the patient.# Normally it is only a partial defence and court has right to fix liabilities between doctor and patient (doctrine of comparative negligence) and damages awarded may be reduced accordingly.# Contributory negligence can be used as defence by the doctor, but in civil cases only. It cannot be used as defence in followingi) Criminal negligenceii) Last clear chance doctrine; i.e. if doctor has discovered it before causing injury and failed to avoid that.iii) Avoidable consequences rule; i.e. due to negligence of doctor, there occurs damage to patient, but due to later damage of patient, damage becomes more.Good samartion doctrine: One who assisted another in serious need cannot be charged for contributory negligence, provided that the assistance is not rash and reckless.8) Vicarious responsibility (Liability):# It means master is liable for negligent acts of his servants, even inspite of absence of blame-worthy conduct on his part.# Thus hospital and senior medical staff are responsible for negligent act of junior medical staff (interns and resident doctors). This responsibility is there because of master servant relationship, i.e. the senior can dictate the line of treatment to be followed. However, hospital is not responsible for senior medical staff as master servent relationship does not exist.# The vicarious responsibility is there only in civil negligence cases and not in criminal cases.9) Borrowed servant doctrine (captain of the ship doctrine):# The private practitioner, who is not a staff of a private hospital, will be held responsible for all the negligent acts by any of the hospital staff on the patient admitted by him.# The hospital will not be held here liable, because all the instructions for the patient admitted is carried on by hospital staff as told by private practitioner (i.e. he is the captain of the ship).10) Product liability:# Manufacturer is liable for quality of drug and medical equipment.",C

RDA cover of nutrient requirement of -,50% of individuals,75% of individual,98% of individuals,Same as adequate intake,"BALANCED DIET A diet may be defined as the kinds of food on which a person or group lives. A balanced diet is defined as one which contains a variety of foods in such quantities and propoions that the need for energy, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrate and other nutrients is adequately met for maintaining health, vitality and general well-being and also makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand sho duration of leanness. A balanced diet has become an accepted means to safeguard a population from nutritional deficiencies. In constructing balanced diet, the following principles should be borne in mind : (a) First and foremost, the daily requirement of protein should be met. This amounts to 10-15 per cent of the daily energy intake. (b) Next comes the fat requirement, which should be limited to 15-30 per cent of the daily energy intake (c) Carbohydrates rich in natural fibre should constitute the remaining food energy. The dietary pattern varies widely in different pas of the world. It is generally developed around the kinds of food produced (or impoed) depending upon the climatic conditions of the region, economic capacity, religion, customs, taboos, tastes and habits of the people. It takes into account 95-98% of population. Balanced diets formulated by the Indian Council of Medical Research are given in Annexure II at the end of this chapter. A nutritional education guide 'The Food Guide Pyramid' emphasizes foods from the five major food groups shown in the three lower sections of the Pyramid.

"Atrial fibrillation may occur in all of the following conditions, except-",Mitral stenosis,Hypothyroidism,Dilated cardiomyopathy,Mitral regurgitation,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, with an overall prevalence of 0.5% in the adult population of the UK. The prevalence rises with age, affecting 1% of those aged 60-64 years, increasing to 9% of those aged over 80 years. It is associated with significant morbidity and a twofold increase in moality. This is mainly because of its association with underlying hea disease but also because of its association with systemic embolism and stroke. Pathogenesis AF is a complex arrhythmia characterised by both abnormal automatic firing and the presence of multiple interacting re-entry circuits looping around the atria. Episodes of AF are initiated by rapid bursts of ectopic beats arising from conducting tissue in the pulmonary veins or from diseased atrial tissue. It becomes sustained because of re-entrant conduction within the atria or sometimes because of continuous ectopic firing . Re-entry is more likely to occur in atria that are enlarged or in which conduction is slow, as is the case in many forms of hea disease. During episodes of AF, the atria beat rapidly but in an uncoordinated and ineffective manner. The ventricles are activated irregularly at a rate determined by conduction through the AV node. This produces the characteristic 'irregularly irregular' pulse. The ECG shows normal but irregular QRS complexes; there are no P waves but the baseline may show irregular fibrillation waves. Commonly, AF is classified as paroxysmal (intermittent episodes that self-terminate within 7 days) Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1534",B

"In the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocytes share a similar function with",Gemistocytes,Astrocytes,Schwann cells,Microglial cells,"Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) share a similar function with Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system-synthesis of myelin. Oligodendrocytes are small, round, lymphocyte-size cells that produce and maintain CNS myelin, which is primarily located in the white matter. Ceain diseases, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, caused by a papovavirus, specifically attack oligodendrocytes and produce demyelination. Oligodendrogliomas are malignant tumors that are derived from oligodendrocytes. However, unlike Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes contribute segments of myelin sheaths to more than one axon. Gemistocytes are reactive astrocytes that have an eosinophilic cytoplasm. They are commonly seen along the periphery of cerebral infarctions. Some astrocytomas have a gemistocytic appearance. Astrocytes provide the structural framework for the neurons and are analogous to the fibroblasts in connective tissue. However, scarring in the brain is not associated with collagen synthesis but with filling in the defect with the cellular processes of astrocytes. A cerebral abscess is the only example of CNS repair with collagen, which is derived from the blood vessels. Microglial cells are derived from monocytes. They are the phagocytic cell of the CNS. Ependymal cells line the ventricles of the brain and the spinal canal. They do not produce CSF nor are they responsible for reabsorption of CSF, a function relegated to arachnoid cells.

Area under standard normal distribution curve o It can be understand by the 68-95-99.7 rule - i) The area between one standard detion on either side of the mean ( +- 1 a) will include 68 percent of the values. ii) The area between two standard detions on either side of the mean will cover 95% of values. iii) The area between three standard detion will include 99.7% of values. o These limits on either side of the mean is called 'confidence limits'. o For example, if we are considering the 95 percent confidence limits (Area under 2 SD), that means that 95% of the values in the distribution will be included between the limits (2 SD --> x +- 2 a). Therefore, the probability of a reading falling outside confidence limit (95%) is only 5%, i.e. 1 in 20 (P = 0.05). o So, For 1 SD, confidence limit 68% For 2 SD, confidence limit 95% For 3 SD, confidence limit --> 99.7% Note: Generally we consider that for 2SD, confidence limit is 95%. However, actual (exact) values are slightly different-o Actual parameters in a Normal (Gaussian) distribution. o Mean +- 1 SD ( la) limits include 68.27% values o Mean +- 2SD ( 26) limits include 95.45% values o Mean +- 1.96SD ( 1.966) limits include 95% values o Mean +- 3SD ( 3a) limits include 99.73% values o Mean +- 2.58SD ( +- 2.58 a) limits include 99% values Also know: o Values that differ from the mean by more than 2SD are rare, being only 4.55%. o Values higher or lower than the Mean +- 3SD ( 36) are very rare, being only 0.27%. o 6 SD (3 on either side of mean) cover almost the entire range of a variable character (SD divides the range into 6 equal sub-range) o Minimum sample size required for establishment of normal range for any health parameter: 300 healthy subjects. o Confidence limits of normal curve can never be 100%. therefore the limbs of curve never touch base line.",C

Causative agent for kala-azar/ visceral leishmaniasis: September 2011,Leishmania donovani,Leishmania tropica,Leishmania braziliensis,None of the above,"Ans. A: Leishmani Donovani Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of kala-azar (VL) Visceral leishmaniasis/ VL/ kala-azar/ black fever/ Dumdum fever It is the most severe form of leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. This disease is the second-largest parasitic killer in the world (after malaria) The parasite migrates to the internal organs such as liver, spleen (hence 'visceral') and bone marrow Several species of Leishmania are known to give rise to the visceral form of the disease. The 'Old World' (Africa, Asia, Europe) species are L. donovani and L. infantum and the 'New World' (South America) species is L. chagasi. Life-cycle of the parasite Visceral leishmaniasis (Kala-azar) is spread through an insect vector, the sandfly of the Phlebotomus genus in the Old World and the Lutzomyia genus in the New World. Sandflies are tiny creatures, 3-6 millimeters long by 1.5-3 millimeters in diameter, and found in tropical or temperate regions throughout the world. Sandfly larvae grow in warm, moist organic matter, such as old trees, house walls or waste -- making them hard to eradicate. The adult female sand fly is a bloodsucker, usually feeding at night on sleeping prey. When the fly bites an animal infected with L. donovani, the pathogen is ingested along with the prey's blood. At this point the protozoan is in the smaller of its two forms, called an amastigote -- round, non-motile, and only three to seven micrometers in diameter. Taken into the stomach of the sandfly, the amastigotes quickly transform into a second L. donovani form, called the promastigote. This form is spindle-shaped, triple the size of the amastigote, and has a single flagellum that allows for motility.The promastigotes live extracellularly in the sandfly's alimentary canal, reproducing asexually, then migrate to the proximal end of the gut where they become poised for a regurgitational transmission. This is their means of transmission back into a mammalian host, as the fly injects its saliva into prey when it bites. The promastigotes are introduced locally at the bite site along with the fly's saliva. Once inside the new host, promastigotes invade macrophages. Once inside, they transform back into the smaller amastigote form. As an amastigote, L. donovani can only reproduce intracellularly -- and the amastigotes replicate in the most hostile pa of the macrophage cell, inside the phagolysosome, whose normal defensive response they are able to prevent. After they have reproduced to a ceain extent, the L. donovani lyse their host cell by sheer pressure of mass, but there is some recent speculation that they are able to leave the cell by triggering the exocytosis response of the macrophage. The daughter cell protozoans then migrate through the bloodstream to find new macrophage hosts. In time, L. donovani becomes a systemic infection, spreading to all the host's organs, paicularly the spleen and liver",A
A girl presented with severe hyperkalemia and peaked T waves on ECG. Fastest way of shifting potassium intracellularly is -,Calcium gluconate IV,Oral resins,Insulin + glucose,Sodium bicarbonate,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Insulin + glucose Tall T waves on ECG indicate cardiac manifestation of hyperkalemia.Intravenous calcium gluconate is the first drug to be administered in a patient with hyperkalemia having E.C.G. abnormalities. - It stabilizes the myocardium immediately. - It acts within minutes and is characterized by improvement in E. C. G. appearance.But an important point to noteIt does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia.Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium.'Intravenous insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levelsThe goals of the therapy for the t/t of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:-Antagonize the affect of K+ on excitable cell membranesRedistribution of extracellular potassium into cellsEnhance elimination of potassium from the bodyAntagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membraneCalcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia.It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes.Calcium for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt.The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis.The onset of action is < 3 minutes.The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time further measures may be undertaken to lower pK.Redistribution of potassium into cells InsulinInsulin shifts potassium into cells.Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ K+ ATPase.I. V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium level Q.The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes.Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia.It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release.The administration of hypertonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasonsEndogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect.There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypertonicity. b adrenoceptor agonistsThese drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell.High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours,The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol.Patients taking nonselective b adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterolEven among patient's not taking b blockers as many as 40% seem to be resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol.The mechanism for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond.For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. BicarbonateBicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate.It has now been demonstrated that short term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause K+shift into cells.Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift K+ into cells even after several hours.It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary K+ elimination in patients with some kidney function, although it use for this purpose has not been evaluated.Elimination of potassium from the bodyHyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency.However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron.Sodium bicarbonateA sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis.The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can be mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis.Exchange resinSodium polystyrene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin.In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium.Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut.There are two concerns with the use of resin in the t/t of urgent hyperkalemiaThe first is its slow effectWhen given orally, the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen for more than 6 hrs.The second is its adverse effectIt can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis'Hemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body'.The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hemodialysis.",C

Chronic unexplained diarrhea also should suggest gastrinoma. Approximately 20-25% of patients with ZES have MEN 1, and in most cases hyperparathyroidism is present before the gastrinoma. These patients are treated differently from those without MEN 1; therefore, MEN 1 should be sought in all patients by family history and by measuring plasma ionized calcium and prolactin levels and plasma hormone levels (parathormone, growth hormone).",C

Demographic gap attains its maximum limit is,Early stage I,Late stage II,Late stage III,Early stage IV,"Demographic cycle The history of world population since 1650 suggests that there is a . demographic cycle of 5 stages through which a nation passes: (1) FIRST STAGE (High stationary) This stage is characterized by a high bih rate and a high death rate which cancel each other and the population remains stationary. India was in this stage till 1920. (2) SECOND STAGE (Early expanding) The death rate begins to decline, while the bih rate remains unchanged. Many countries in South Asia, and Africa are in this phase. Bih rates have increased in some of these countries possibly as a result of improved health conditions, and shoening periods of breast-feeding (3) THIRD STAGE (Late expanding) The death rate declines still fuher, and the bih rate tends to fall. The population continues to grow because bihs exceed deaths. India has entered this phase. In a number of developing countries (e.g., China, Singapore) bih rates have declined rapidly. (4) FOUH STAGE (Low stationary) This stage is characterized by a low bih and low death rate with the result that the population becomes stationary. Zero population growth has already been recorded in Austria during 1980-85. Growth rates as little as 0.1 were recorded in UK, Denmark, Sweden and Belgium during 1980-85. In sho, most industrialized countries have undergone a demographic transition shifting from a high bih and high death rates to low bih and low death rates. (5) FIFTH STAGE: (Declining) The population begins to decline because bih rate is lower than the death rate. Some East European countries, notably Germany and Hungary are experiencing this stage. Demographic cycle is based on : Demographic gap DG = Crude Bih Rate (CBR) - Crude death rate DG stas increasing : Early stage II (Early expanding phase) DG is Maximum : Late stage II (Early expanding phase) DG stas declining : Early stage III (Late expanding PHASE) DG is negative : Stage V (Declining phase) DG is Narrow : Stage I (high Stationary) ; Stage IV (Low Stationary) Ref: Foundations of community Medicine, GM Dhaarb& I Robbani, 1st edition Park 25th edition Pgno : 530",B

Takayama test is to detect,Identification of source of hair,Nature of stain,Detection of species,Blood group,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Nature of stain * The examination of blood and blood stains is an important part of crime detection. The points that are usually required to be determined regarding stains are: (1) nature of stain (whether the stains is blood or not); (2) the species (human or animal) from which the blood has come from; and (3) blood group.Nature of stain (whether the stain is blood or not)* To determine the nature of stain, following tests are used:1) Chemical tests# These tests are based on the peroxidase activity of haematin, which is, derived from oxidation of haem of haemoglobin or methemoglobin, present.# This enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide converts colourless salts into coloured bases.# Thus these tests are based on H2O2 and peroxidase enzyme. Tests are:i) Benzidine test: Greenish blue colour.ii) Phenolphthalein test (kastle myere test): Deep permanganate colour.iii) Leucomalachite green test: Bluish green or peacock blue colour.iv) Guaiacum test: Blue colour.v) Orthotoludine test (kohn test): Blue or green colour.vi) Amidopyrine test: Purple colour.2) Microchemical tests# These tests are based on property of haem part of hemoglobin to form characteristic coloured crystals.# The tests are:1) Teichmann's haemin crystal test.2) Takayama hemochromogen crystal test.3) Luminal spray test: It is especially useful in old obscure blood stains.3) Spetroscopy# It is most delicate and reliable test. It is based on the principle that hemoglobin and its derivatives give characteristic absorption bands when viewed through a spectroscope.4) Microscopy# Microscopic examination of RBCs is possible only in fresh stains.Detection of species (whether the blood has come from human or animal)* For detection of species, serological (immunological) tests are used. These tests are:1) Precipitin test2) Haemaglutination inhibition test (antiglobulin consumption test or absorption inhibition test).3) Gel diffusion test.4) Double diffusion test.5) Precipitation electrophoresis.6) Latex agglutination test.7) Isoenzyme method (enzymological test).Detection of blood group of blood stain* These tests are:1) Immunological (serological): (i) aborption-elution test, (ii) absorption-inhibition test, (iii) mixed agglutination test, (iv) latex test.2) Enzymological methods.3) Latte's crust method.",B

"All of the following statements about treatment of typical CLL are true, except :",Treatment should be initiated as soon as diagnosis is established,Chlorambucil and Fludarabine are the most commonly used agents,Fludarabine is preferred in the young and Chlorambucil is preferred in the elderly,Young patients are candidates for Bone marrow transplantation,Answer is A (Treatment should be initiated as soon as diagnosis is established) It is not essential to initiate treatment as soon as a diagnosis of CLL is established. 'An unusual feature of CLL compared to other leukemias is that making the diagnosis is not necessarily an indication to initiate treatment' - DeVita Treatment need not be initiated as soon as diagnosis of CLL is established Early stage asymptomatic disease requires no treatment. CLL may be diagnosed in an asymptomatic patient and have a prolonged course. Meta-analysis has shown no survival advantage of initiating treatment in early stage disease. Active monitoring should however be pursued and treatment initiated only if and when the patient meets established 'criteria for treatment'. Criteria for treatment Progressive marrow failure Massive(>10cm)/progressive lymphadenopathy Massive (>6cm)/progressive splenomegaly Progressive lymphocytosis (doubling time <6 months) Systemic symptoms; Weight loss >10%in 6 months fever>38deg C for >2 weeks extreme fatigue or night sweats Autoimmune cytopenias (this may only require treatment of the autoimmune component not necessarily the leukaemia) Chlorambucil and Fludarabine are the most commonly used agents. The most common treatment for CLL are Chlorambucil or Fludarabine alone or in combination. Chlorambucil Can be administered orally and has few side effects Less active than Fludarabine and usually unsuccessful in achieving remission Most common agent chosen for treatment of elderly patients requiring therapy. (Majority of elderly patients have significant comorbid conditions associated with aging and may have an indolent disease) Fludarabine Administered intravenously and has significant side effects (Significant immune suppression) More active agent and by far the only drug associatedwith a significant incidence of complete remission Preferred agent for treatment of young patientsrequiring therapy Fludarabine is often used incombination with Cyclophosphamide (FC).Following theresults of LRF CC4 Trial many now consider FC to be thegold standard first Line treatment of CLL in the young Young patients are candidates for Bone marrow transplanatation Bendamustine is an alkylating agent structurally related to nitrogen mustards that is highly effective and is vying with fludarabine as the primary treatment of choice. Rituximab (AntiCD20) and Alemtuzumab (anti CD52) may also be used. `Young patients with CLL can be candidates for Allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation can be urative but is associated with a significant treatment related moality rate' - Harrison,A

Khesari dhal (lathyrus sativus), is consumed in pas of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, excessive consumption of which is associated with lathyrism. Pulses contain 20 to 25 per cent of proteins, which is double that found in wheat and three times that found in rice. II') fact, pulses contain more protein than eggs, fish or flesh foods. But in regard to quality, pulse proteins are inferior to animal proteins. Pulse proteins are poor in methionine and to a lesser extent in cysteine. On the other hand they are rich in lysine. Soyabean is exceptionally rich in protein, containing up to 40 per cent. In addition, pulses are rich in minerals and B-group vitamins such as riboflavin and thiamine. In the dry state, pulses do not contain vitamin C. Germinating pulses, however, contain higher concentration of vitamins, especially vitamin C and B vitamins. Fermentation also modifies the nutritive value of pulses .in that the vitamin content paicularly that of riboflavin, thiamine and niacin is enhanced. Although pulses are called 'poor man's meat', they are eaten by the rich and poor alike in India. They give variety to the diet and make the food more palatable. Ref : Park 25th edition Pgno : 649",D

A patient is found to be positive for HBs Ag on routine laboratory evaluation. Other serological tests for hepatitis are unremarkable. He is clinically asymptomatic and liver enzymes are within the normal range. Which of the following best describes his diagnosis:,Inactive HBV carrier,Acute Hepatitis B,Chronic Hepatitis B,Active HBV carrier,"Answer is A (Inactive HBV carrier) Absence of clinical signs and symptoms of liver damage and normal liver enzymes in an HBs Ag positive individual with otherwise unremarkable serological tests suggests a diagnosis of Inactive HBV carrier state. 'An inactive hepatitis B carrier is defined as one with HBs Ag in serum hut without HBe Ag with normal liver function tests and with low/ undetectable levels of HBV DNA (< 103-104 virions/ml) - 'Blue Prints Pocket Gastroenterology' by Grover (Lippincott Williams) 1st (2007) /114 Chronic Hepatitis B carriers (HBs Ag + ye with IgG Anti HBc) Chronic Hepatitis B virus carriers can be divided into two categories based on activity of the virus and evidence of liver damage Inactive HBs Ag Carrier state Patients with negligible virus replication (HBV DNA levels < 103 virions/m1) and /or no clinical signs and symptoms of liver damage and normal liver enzyme levels are characterized as inactive HBV carriers Inactive HBV carriers harbor Hepatitis B virus antigen (HBs Ag), but are clinically asymptomatic, have a normal physical examination with normal liver enzymes (AST & ALT). HBe Ag is typically negative and levels of HBV DNA are less than 103-104 virions/ml Such patients have minimal (if any) liver inflammation or damage, and usually live a normal life. However compared to the general population these patients remain at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma Treatment is currently not recommended for Inactive HBV carrier. However regular observation is advised as there is a risk for reactivation of virus. Chronic Hepatitis B (Active) Patients with active virus replication ( HBV DNA levels > 103 -104 virions/ml) and /or clinical signs and symptoms of liver damage or elevated liver enzyme levels are characterized as chronic hepatitis B patients. Depending on the presence or absence of HBe Ag two type of chronic (active) hepatitis B may be identified. HBe Ag positive chronic hepatitis B These HBs Ag positive, individuals are also positive for HBe Ag and show detectable HBV DNA levels. Such patients are in the replicative phase of chronic hepatitis B infection, have persistently or intermittently elevated liver enzymes and liver biopsy results typically reveals inflammation and damage Patients with chronic (active) hepatitis B may become inactive (relatively non replicative) over time (rate of L-10 % per year) by becoming negative for HBe Ag and HBV DNA (HBV DNA < 10' - 104) virions/ml) Liver injury tend to subside in such patients and these may then be characterized as 'inactive carriers' HBe Ag negative chronic hepatitis B (Precore mutant) Such HBs Ag positive individuals are negative for HBe Ag but show detectable HBV DNA levels. Such patients are also in the replicative phase of chronic hepatitis B (despite negative HBe Ag) and have persistently or intermittently elevated liver enzymes and liver biopsy results typically reveal severe inflammation and damage Negative HBe Ag Status results from a mutant strain of hepatitis B that is characterized by the .failure of the virus to make the hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBe Ag). This mutation is called the `precore' mutation as it prevents the translation of a precore protein to prevent HBe antigen production.

Drug of choice in HOCM ?,Beta blocker,Dopamine,Amiodarone,ACEI,"BETA BLOCKERS ARE THE FIRST LINE DRUGS IN HOCM The primary goal of medications is to relieve symptoms such as chest pain, shoness of breath, and palpitations. Beta blockers are considered first-line agents, as they can slow down the hea rate and decrease the likelihood of ectopic beats. For people who cannot tolerate beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil can be used, but are potentially harmful in people who also have low blood pressure or severe shoness of breath at rest. These medications also decrease the hea rate, though their use in people with severe outflow obstruction, elevated pulmonary aery wedge pressure, and low blood pressures should be done with caution. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided in people with evidence of obstruction. For people whose symptoms are not relieved by the above treatments, disopyramide can be considered for fuher symptom relief. Diuretics can be considered for people with evidence of fluid overload, though cautiously used in those with evidence of obstruction. People who continue to have symptoms despite drug therapy can consider more invasive therapies. Intravenous phenylephrine (or another pure vasoconstricting agent) can be used in the acute setting of low blood pressure in those with obstructive hyperophic cardiomyopathy who do not respond to fluid administration.

This measure of effect size differs from the odds ratio in that it compares probabilities instead of odds, but asymptotically approaches the latter for small probabilities. While both measures are useful, they have different statistical uses. In medical research, for example, the odds ratio is oured for case-control studies and retrospective studies.

'Falanga' is,Pulling of hair,Hitting the feet with stick,Electric current for toure,Sitting in abnormal position,"TOURE METHODS: The methods of toure are wide and varying. (I) PHYSICAL ABUSE : (1) Beating is the commonest form. Fist, foot or an instrument, such as lathi, metal or wooden bars, whips, belts, cycle chains, etc., are used. The usual target is the back, but injuries may be seen on almost any pa of the body. Abrasions, contusions, lacerations and fractures may be found. Bruises in abdominal wall and rupture of internal organs may be seen. Poking with stick, baton, rod, etc. is common. (2) Falanga (faiaka, bastinado): In this canes or rods are used to beat on the soles of the feet, or rarely to the palms of the hands or hips, which is very painful and debilitating. Contusions are found deep in the tissues. Faint red lines may be seen, and often hyperpigmentation along the lines of injury. Aseptic necrosis may occur. (3) Telefono: It consists of repeated slapping of the sides of the head (over ears) by the open palms of the assailant. This may cause rupture of ear drums and injury to the inner ear.

A patient after thrombolysis for MI develops missed beats. ECG shows?,Mobitz I heart block,Mobitz II heart block,Complete heart block,Sick sinus syndrome,"Ans. (b) Mobitz II heart block.In 30 seconds you get in the examination for this rhythm strip compare the PR interval preceding the missed/arrow marked qRS complex with the subsequent one. If both the preceding and subsequent PR intervals are equal then, it is diagnostic of Mobitz II heart block. This usually occurs secondary to septal MI and needs pacing.In case the PR interval preceding the missed beat is longer in duration than the PR interval subsequent to the missed beat, it is diagnostic of Mobitz 1 heart block.* Mobitz II is usually due to failure of conduction at the level of the His-Purkinje system (i.e. below the AV node).* While Mobitz I is usually due to a functional suppression of AV conduction (e.g. due to drugs, reversible ischemia), Mobitz II is more likely to be due to structural damage to the conducting system (e.g. infarction, fibrosis, necrosis).* Patients typically have a pre-existing LBBB or bifascicular block, and the 2nd degree AV block is produced by intermittent failure of the remaining fascicle ('bilateral bundle-branch block').* In around 75% of cases, the conduction block is located distal to the Bundle of His, producing broad qRS complexes.* In the remaining 25% of cases, the conduction block is located within the His Bundle itself, producing narrow qRS complexes.* Unlike Mobitz I, which is produced by progressive fatigue of the AV nodal cells, Mobitz II is an 'all or nothing' phenomenon whereby the His-Purkinje cells suddenly and unexpectedly fail to conduct a supraventricular impulse.* Ihere may be no pattern to the conduction blockade, or alternatively there may be a fixed relationship between the P waves and qRS complexes, e.g. 2:1 block, 3:1 block.",B

A middle aged man noticed that he can no longer fit in his shoes and enlarging of jaw and phalanges. These effects are mediated by?,ACTH,TRH,Somatomedin,TGF beta,"ANSWER: (C) SomatomedinREF: Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th edition chapter 333Symptoms are suggestive of Acromegaly & GH effects are mediated via Somatomedins. Principal Somatomedins are IGF-I, IGF-II.CLINICAL FEATURES OF ACROMEGALY:Protean manifestations of GH and IGF-I hypersecretion are indolent and often are not clinically diagnosed for 10 years or more. Acral bony overgrowth results in frontal bossing, increased hand and foot size, mandibular enlargement with prognathism, and widened space between the lower incisor teeth.In children and adolescents, initiation of GH hypersecretion prior to epiphyseal long bone closure is associated with development of pituitary gigantism.Soft tissue swelling results in increased heel pad thickness, increased shoe or glove size, ring tightening, characteristic coarse facial features, and a large fleshy nose.Other commonly encountered clinical features include hyperhidrosis, deep and hollow- sounding voice, oily skin, arthropathy, kyphosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, proximal muscle weakness and fatigue, acanthosis nigricans, and skin tags.Generalized visceromegaly occurs, including cardiomegaly, macroglossia, and thyroid gland enlargementThe most significant clinical impact of G H exces s occurs with respect to the cardiovascular system. Coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy with arrhythmias, left ventricular hypertrophy, decreased diastolic function, and hypertension occur in about 30% of patientsUpper airway obstruction with sleep apnea occurs in more than 60% of patients and isassociated with both soft tissue laryngeal airway obstruction and central sleep dysfunctionDiabetes mellitus develops in 25% of patients with acromegaly, and most patients are intolerant of a glucose load (as GH counteracts the action of insulin).Laboratory InvestigationAge- and gender-matched serum IGF-I (somatomedin) levels are elevated in acromegaly. Consequently, an IGF-I level provides a useful laboratory screening measure when clinical features raise the possibility of acromegaly.Due to the pulsatility of GH secretion, measurement of a single random GH level is not useful for the diagnosis or exclusion of acromegaly and does not correlate with disease severity.The diagnosis of acromegaly is confirmed by demonstrating the failure of GH suppression to <1 ug/L within 1-2 h of an oral glucose load (75 g).",C

Number of doses for treatment of Vitamin A deficiency is,1,2,3,4,"Prevention of Vitamin A deficiency Prevention and/or control takes two forms (a) improvement of people's diet so as to ensure a regular and adequate intake of foods rich in vitamin A, and (b) reducing the frequency and severity of contributory factors, e.g., PEM, respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea and measles. Both are long term measures involving intensive nutrition education of the public and community paicipation. Since vitamin A can be stored in the body for 6 to 9 months and liberated slowly, a sho term, simple technology had been evolved by the National Institute of Nutrition at Hyderabad (India) for community based intervention Against nutritional blindness, which has subsequently been adopted by other countries . Vitamin A deficiency treatment : Vitamin A on days 1,2 and 14 each (for age >12 months, give 200,000IU; for age 6-12 months, give 100,000 IU; for age 0-5 months, give 50,000IU The strategy is to administer a single massive dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin A in oil (retinof palmitate) orally every 6 months to preschool children (1 year to 6 years), and half that dose (100,000 IU) to children between 6 months and one year of age8.

Which of the following is true regarding thyrotoxicosis?,"In Grave’s disease, antibodies are formed to TSH receptors, which result in excessive thyroxine secretion",Hashimoto's thyroiditis occur in young males,"In primary hypothyroidism, decreased TSH levels are seen",All of the above,"Pathophysiology of Graves’ thyrotoxicosis
The thyrotoxicosis results from the production of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies directed against the TSH receptor on the thyroid follicular cell, which stimulate thyroid hormone production and proliferation of follicular cells, leading to goitre in the majority of patients. These antibodies are termed thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins or TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) and can be detected in the serum of 80–95% of patients with Graves’ disease. 
The concentration of TRAb in the serum is presumed to ﬂuctuate to account for the natural history of Graves’ thyrotoxicosis. Thyroid failure seen in some patients may result from the presence of blocking antibodies against the TSH receptor, and from tissue destruction by cytotoxic antibodies and cell-mediated immunity.
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is characterised by destructive lymphoid inﬁltration of the thyroid, ultimately leading to a varying degree of ﬁbrosis and thyroid enlargement. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis increases in incidence with age and affects approximately 3.5 per 1000 women and 0.8 per 1000 men each year.
In the vast majority of cases, hypothyroidism results from an intrinsic disorder of the thyroid gland (primary hypothyroidism). In this situation, serum T 4  is low and TSH is elevated, usually in excess of 20 mIU/L. Measurements of serum T 3  are unhelpful since they do not discriminate reliably between euthyroidism and hypothyroidism.

Jones Criteria for Diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever Major Criteria Carditis Pancarditis, seen in 50-60% of patients, develops within the first 2 weeks of rheumatic fever. Pericarditis is evidenced by presence of a pericardial rub, myocarditis by tachycardia, soft S1, presence of S3 and CCF and endocarditis by the presence of Carey-Coombs' murmur (mitral diastolic murmur). Ahritis (60-75%) Flitting and fleeting type of polyahritis involving large joints with no residual deformity is seen in 60-75% of patients and occurs early in rheumatic fever. Jaccod's ahritis: Ulnar detion of 4th and 5th finger with flexion at metacarpophalangeal joints is the only residual deformity seen in rheumatic polyahritis. Subcutaneous Nodules Non-tender nodules are seen over bony prominences like elbows, shin, occiput, spine in 3-5% of patients and occur 3-6 weeks after onset of rheumatic fever. Patients who have subcutaneous nodules almost always have carditis. Erythema Marginatum (< 5% and evanescent) Macular lesions with an erythematous rim and central clearing in a bathing suit distribution are seen in < 5% of patients and occur early in rheumatic fever. Chorea (Sydenham's Chorea) (2-30%) A neurological disorder with rapid, involuntary and purposeless non-repetitive movements with a self limiting course of 2-6 weeks is more common in females and is a late manifestation of rheumatic fever. Minor Criteria Clinical 1. Fever 2. Ahralgia 3. Previous history of rheumatic fever or rheumatic hea disease. Laboratory 1. Acute phase reactants (leucocytosis, raised ESR, C-reactive protein) 2.

Harrison's 18th/pg. 3049; Chapter 349.)Turner's Syndrome (Gonadal Dxsgenesis: 45.X)# PATHOPHYSIOLOGY- Approximately one-half of individuals with Turner's syndrome have a 45,X karyotype, about 20% have 45,X/46,XX mosaicism, and the remainder have structural abnormalities of the X chromosome such as X fragments, isochromosomes, or rings. The clinical features of TS result from haploinsufficiency of multiple X chromosomal genes (e.g., short stature homeobox, SHOX). However, imprinted genes also may be affected when the inherited X has different parental origins.# CLINICAL FEATURES- TS is characterized by bilateral streak gonads, primary amenorrhea, short stature, and multiple congenital anomalies in phenotypic females. It affects 1 in 2500 women and is diagnosed at different ages depending on the dominant clinical features. Prenatally, a diagnosis of TS usually is made incidentally after chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis for unrelated reasons such as advanced maternal age. Prenatal ultrasound findings include increased nuchal translucency. The postnatal diagnosis of TS should be considered in female neonates or infants with lymphedema, nuchal folds, low hairline, or left-sided cardiac defects and in girls with unexplained growth failure or pubertal delay. The vast majority of women with TS develop complete ovarian failure.# Treatment:- Individuals with congenital heart defects (CHDs) (30%) (bicuspid aortic valve, 30-50%; coarctation of the aorta, 30%; aortic root dilation, 5%) require long-term follow, antibiotic prophylaxis for dental or surgical procedures, and serial imaging of aortic root dimensions, as progressive aortic root dilation is associated with increased risk of aortic dissection.- Individuals found to have congenital renal and urinary tract malformations (30%) are at risk for urinary tract infections, hypertension, and nephrocalcinosis. Hypertension can occur independently.- Clitoral enlargement or other evidence of virilization suggests the presence of covert, translocated Y chromosomal material and is associated with increased risk of gonadoblastoma, apparently as a consequence of Y chromosomal genes distinct from SRY.Autoimmune hypothyroidism (15-30%) can occur in childhood.- The treatment of short stature in children with TS remains a challenge, as untreated final height rarely exceeds 150 cm in nonmosaic 45,X TS. High-dose recombinant growth hormone stimulates growth rate in children with TS and may be used alone or in combination with low doses of the nonaromatizable anabolic steroid oxandrolone (up to 0.05 mg/kg per d) in an older child (>9 years).- Most physicians now choose to initiate low-dose estrogen therapy.",D

Its good sources are oat, flaxseeds, peas, beans, apple, citrus fruits, carrots, barley and psyllium.ii) Insoluble fibre: It promotes movement of material through digestive system and increases stool bulk. Its good sources are wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts and vegetables.Advantages of fibreso Dietry fibre contribute bulk by absorbing water 1-15 times of its own weight and thus hastens the passage through the gut, decreasing the transient time.o By increasing the bulk, it provides a larger volume of indigestible material to colon.o Dietary fibre is known to be associated with reduced incidence of coronary artery diseases. The mechanism of its action is attributed to its binding to bile salts and preventing its absorption and thus reducing cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) level in circulation.o The fibre, particularly the gum and pectin, when ingested with a diet, are reported to reduce post-prandial glucose level in blood - helpful in DM.o Dietary fibre reduce the incidence of diverticulitis, constipation, hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome and colon cancer.",D

Persistent low complement level is not found in -,Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis,Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis,Cryoglobulinemia,SLE,"Acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an immunologic response of the kidney to infection, characterized by the sudden appearance of edema, hematuria, proteinuria and hypeension . It is essentially a disease of childhood that accounts for approximately 90% of renal disorders in children Infection-related glomerulonephritis RPGN may occur either during or following an infection. In both cases, circulating immune complexes are present and activation of the complement system promotes consumption of complement factors, resulting in low serum C3 and C4 concentration, as observed in many causes of glomerulonephritis . Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is observed most commonly in children and young adults, and typically presents 10 days after a streptococcal throat infection or longer after a skin infection. The clinical presentation ranges from mild abnormalities on urinalysis to RPGN with severe AKI. The anti-streptolysin (ASO) test is positive in up to 95% of patients with streptococcal throat infections. Treatment is suppoive, with control of blood pressure and fluid overload with salt restriction, diuretics and dialysis if required. Antibiotic therapy is rarely needed, as the renal disease occurs after the infection has subsided. The medium-term prognosis for children and most adults is good, with recovery of renal function typical even in those requiring dialysis therapy. Some patients may develop CKD 20-30 years after the original presentation, however. An immune complex-mediated disease may also be observed during an infection, typically a staphylococcal infection such as endocarditis, skin infection or pneumonia, but also with subacute endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. This occurs more commonly in older adults and the presentation tends not to be as fulminant as with post-streptococcal disease. In addition to suppoive measures, antibiotic therapy is required, as infection is usually concurrent with renal disease. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 401",A

Eaton Lambe syndrome is associated with,Anti P/Q antibody,Anti HU antibody,Anti Jo 1 antibody,Large cell carcinoma,"Lambe-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness of the limbs. In normal neuromuscular function, a nerve impulse is carried down the axon (the long projection of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse is transferred to the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts. In LEMS, antibodies against VGCC, paicularly the P/Q-type VGCC, decrease the amount of calcium that can enter the nerve ending, hence less acetylcholine can be released from the neuromuscular junction. Apa from skeletal muscle, the autonomic nervous system also requires acetylcholine neurotransmission; this explains the occurrence of autonomic symptoms in LEMSP/Q voltage-gated calcium channels are also found in the cerebellum, explaining why some experience problems with coordination. The antibodies bind paicularly to the pa of the receptor known as the 'domain III S5-S6 linker peptide'.Antibodies may also bind other VGCCs.Some have antibodies that bind synaptotagmin, the protein sensor for calcium-regulated vesicle fusion.Many people with LEMS, both with and without VGCC antibodies, have detectable antibodies against the M1 subtype of the acetylcholine receptor; their presence may paicipate in a lack of compensation for the weak calcium influx anti p/Q antibodies are produced against voltage gated channels mainly P/Q voltage gates Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 567",A

A patient Shweta with raised serum alkaline phosphatase and raised parathormone level along with low calcium and low phosphate level is likely to have-,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Paget's disease,Osteoporosis,Vitamin D deficiency,"clinical syndrome of vitamin D deficiency can be a result of deficient production of vitamin D in the skin, lack of dietary intake, accelerated losses of vitamin D, impaired vitamin D activation, or resistance to the biologic effects of 1,25(OH) 2 D The elderly and nursing home residents are paicularly at risk for vitamin D deficiency, since both the efficiency of vitamin D synthe- sis in the skin and the absorption of vitamin D from the intestine decline with age. Similarly, intestinal malabsorption of dietary fats leads to vitamin D deficiency.The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in oth- erwise healthy individuals is a serum 25(OH)D level. Although the normal ranges vary, levels of 25(OH)D <37 nmol/L (<15 ng/ mL) are associated with increasing PTH levels and lower bone density; optimal vitamin D levels are >80 nmol/L (>32 ng/mL). Vitamin D deficiency leads to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in decreased serum total and ionized calcium val- ues. This hypocalcemia results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, a homeostatic response that initially maintains serum calcium levels at the expense of the skeleton. Due to the PTH-induced increase in bone turnover, alkaline phosphatase levels are often increased. In addition to increasing bone resorption, PTH decreases urinary calcium excretion while promoting phosphaturia. This results in hypophosphatemia, which exacerbates the mineralization defect in the skeleton. With prolonged vitamin D deficiency resulting in osteomalacia, calcium stores in the skeleton become relatively inaccessible, since osteoclasts cannot resorb unmineralized osteoid, and frank hypocalcemia ensues( Harrison 17 pg 2376)",D

Individual in a village population are arranged alphabetically and then every 8th person is selected for the study. The type of study is-,Simple random sampling,Stratified random sampling,Systemic random sampling,Cluster sampling,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Systemic random sampling * Types of random sampling are: -i) Simple random sampling# It is also known as 'unrestricted random sampling'. Each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance. There is no stratification in similar groups. Thus, each individual has the same probability of being chosen.# Methods of simple random sampling are : -i) Lottery methodii) Random number tableiii) Computer technique.# It is suitable for small homogenous population and is used in clinical trials. It provides the greatest number of possible samples.ii) Systemic random sampling# In order to do systematic random sampling, the individuals in a population are arranged in a certain way (for example, alphabetically).# A random starting point is selected and then every nth (for example 10th or 15th) individual is selected for the sample.# That is, after arranging the individuals in certain pattern (e.g., alpabetically) a starting point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter at regular intervals.iii) Stratified random sampling# When sub-populations vary considerably, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently.# Stratification is the process of grouping members of the population into relative hemogenous subgroups before sampling.# The strata should be mutually exclusive, every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. Then systematic random sampling method is applied within each stratum.# Stratified random sampling is particularly useful where one is interested in analysing the data by a certain characteristic of the population, viz Hindus, Muslims, Christians, age group etc, - as we know these groups are not equally distributed in the population.iv) Cluster sampling# Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when natural groupings are evident in a statistical population. In this technique, the total population is divided into these groups (or clusters) and a sample of groups is selected.# The characteristic feature is that selected groups act as samples (while in other types of random sampling individuals act as sample).# Cluster sampling is rapid, simple and economic (less expensive).# Sample size may vary according to study.# Cluster sampling is an example two-stage sampling.# There are chances of sampling error.# Cluster sampling is used in India to evaluate immunization coverage. WHO used 30 x 7 technique (total = 210 children) for cluster sampling in which there are 30 clusters, each containing 7 children who are 12-23 months old and are completely immunized for primary immunization (till measles vaccine at 9 month).v) Multistage random sampling# It is done in successive stages; each successive sampling unit is nested in the previous sampling unit. Advantage: Introduces flexibility in sampling.# For example, in large country surveys, states are chosen, then districts, then villages, then every 10th person in village as final sampling unit.vi) Multiphse random sampling# It is done in successive phase; part of information is obtained from whole sample and part from the sub-sample.# For example, in a TB survey, Mantourx test done in first phase, then X-ray done in all Mantoux positive, then sputum examined in all those with positive X-ray findings.",C

Recall bias is most commonly associated with which study design:,Coho study,Case control study,Cross-sectional study,Randomized controlled trial,"Case control study Recall bias is associated with Case-control studies. Park writes- 'When cases and controls are asked questions about their past history, it may be more likely for the cases to recall the existence of ceain events or factors than the controls who are healthy persons. For example, those who have had a myocardial infarction might be more likely to remember and recall ceain habits or events than those who have not. Thus cases may have a different recall of past events than controls' Recall bias is an error due to the differences in accuracy or completeness of recall to memory of past events or experiences. As a hypothetical example, suppose one is studying the possible relationship of congenital malformations to prenatal infections. A case-control study is conducted and interview is done of mothers of children with congenital malformations (cases) and mothers of children without malformations (controls). Each mother is questioned about infections she may have had during the pregnancy. A mother who has had a child with a bih defect tries to identify some unusual event that occurred during her pregnancy with that child. She wants to know whether the abnormality was caused by something she did. Why did it happen? Such a mother may even recall an event, such as a mild respiratory infection, that a mother of a child without a bih defect may not even notice or may have forgotten completely. This type of bias is known as recall bias. Bias is said to have occurred when there is a systematic difference between the results from a study and the true state of affairs. Bias may be introduced at all stages of the research process, from study design, through to analysis and publication. Bias can create a spurious association (i.e. overestimation of an effect) or mask a real one (underestimation of an effect). While appropriate statistical methods can reduce the effect of bias, they may not be able to eliminate it entirely. Innumerable number of bias have been listed. Bias associated with coho study: Selection Confounding Interviewer's bias Bias associated with Case-control study: Selection Confounding Recall bias Berkesonian bias Interviewer's bias Interviewer bias is a type of information bias that arises when an interviewer consciously or unconsciously elicits inaccurate information from study subjects. Interviewer bias can result in differential error, which can seriously disto disease-exposure associations, if the interviewer is aware of the disease status and exposure hypothesis in a case-control study, or if the interviewer is aware of the exposure status and outcome hypothesis in a coho study. In the former case, the interviewer may probe more deeply for evidence of exposure among cases than among controls. In the latter case, the interviewer may try to elicit evidence of health effects more assiduously in exposed than in unexposed coho members. Selection bias occurs when patients included in the study are not representative of the population to which the results will be applied. Confounding bias occurs when we find a spurious association between a potential risk factor and a disease outcome or miss a real association between them because we have failed to adjust for any confounding variables. A confounding variable or confounder is an exposure variable that is related to both the outcome variable (e.g. disease) and to one or more of the other exposure variables. For example in the study of the role of alcohol in the etiology of esophageal cancer, smoking is the confounding factor because it is associated with the consumption of alcohol and it is also an independent risk factor for esophageal cancer. Thus the effects of alcohol consumption on esophageal cancer can only be determined when the influence of smoking is neutralized by matching. Berkesonian bias: It occurs when patient admission rates vary between the experimental and control groups, especially in studies that use hospitalized patients for both groups. For example, this type of bias is present when hospitalized patients with the risk factor (experimental group) are admitted at a higher rate than the control group.",B

In vitro DNA amplification is done by,Blotting technique,Recombinant technique,Electrophoresis,Polymerase chain reaction,"(D) Polymerase chain reaction # DNA amplification is done by PCR> Blotting technique Following gel electrophoresis, probes are often used to detect specific molecules from the mixture. However, probes cannot be applied directly to the gel. The problem can be solved by three types of blotting methods: Southern blotting, Northern blotting and Western blotting. Southern blotting is a technique for detecting specific DNA fragments in a complex mixture. Northern blotting is used for detecting RNA fragments, instead of DNA fragments. Western blotting is used to detect a particular protein in a mixture. The probe used is therefore not DNA or RNA, but antibodies. The technique is also called 'immunoblotting' PCR: In vitro Techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction allow the amplification of specific DNA sequences so that minute quantities of foreign nucleic acids can be recognized in host specimens. Recombinant DNA refers to a collection of techniques for creating (and analyzing) DNA molecules that contain DNA from two unrelated organisms. One of the DNA molecules is typically a bacterial or viral DNA that is capable of accepting another DNA molecule; this is called a vector DNA. The other DNA molecule is from an organism of interest, which could be anything from a bacterium to a whale, or a human. Combining these two DNA molecules allows for the replication of many copies of a specific DNA. These copies of DNA can be studied in detail, used to produce valuable proteins, or used for gene therapy or other applications. Electrophoresis, also called cataphoresis, is the motion of dispersed particles relative to a fluid under the influence of a spatially uniform electric field. This electrokinetic phenomenon was observed for the first time in 1807 by Reuss , who noticed that the application of a constant electric field caused clay particles dispersed in water to migrate. It is ultimately caused by the presence of a charged interface between the particle surface and the surrounding fluid.",D

A higher blood pressure in the right arm than in the left arm,Inability to augment cardiac output with exercise,Persistent hypeension despite complete surgical repair,"Answer is C (Inability to augment cardiac output with exercise) In coarctation of aoa unless the hypeension is very severe or left ventricular failure has ensued, cardiac output responds normally to exercise. Usually a systolic ejection murmur is heard anteriorly and over the back. If the obstruction is very severe a continuous murmur would be heard. Coarctation of aoa is commonly accompanied by a bicuspid aoic valve, which can produce the diastolic murmur of aoic regurgitation. Coarctation of the Aoa usually occurs just distal to the origin of the left subclan aery. If it arises above the left subclan, Aerial blood pressure elevation may be evident only in the right arm. In coarctation of aoa unless the hypeension is very severe or left ventricular failure has ensued, cardiac output responds normally to exercise.

BCG is-,Live vaccine,Kileld vaccine,Toxoid,None.,"<p>BCG Live vaccine Aim- To induce a benign,aificial primary infection which will stimulate an acquired resistance to possible subsequent infection with virulent tubercle bacilli, and thus reduce the morbidity and moality from primary tuberculosis among those most at risk. WHO recommends the &;Danish 1331&; strain for vaccine production. Stable for several weeks at ambient temperature in a tropical climate and for upto 1 year if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment below 10 deg celcius. Vaccine must be protected from light ( wrapped up in a double layer of red/ black cloth). Normal saline is recommended as diluent for reconstituting the vaccine as distilled water may cause irritation. Reconstituted vaccine may be used within 3 hours. Dosage-0.1 mg in 0.1 ml volume. The dose of newborn below 4 weeks is 0.05 ml. Afministered intradermally using tuberculin syringe. Injected slightly above the inseion of left deltoid. If injected too high / too low adjacent lymph nodes may become involved and tender. The vaccine must not be contaminated with an antiseptic/detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin , it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given. Phenomenon after vaccination:/ 2-3 weeks after a correct intradermal injection of a potent vaccine, a papule develops at the site of vaccination. It increases slowly in size and reaches a a diameter of about 4-8 mm in 5 weeks. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer but usually seen covered by a crust. Healing occurs within 6-12weeks leaving a permanent,tiny, round scar (4-8 mm in diameter).This is a normal reaction. Normally the individual become mantoux postive after 8 weeks has elapsed. Adverse reactions: prolonged severe ulceration at the site of vaccination, suppurative lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection. Contraindications: BCG should not be given to patients with generalised eczema, infective dermatosis, hypogammaglobulinemia , those with history of deficient immunity, patients under immunosuppressive treatment and in pregnancy. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.196}</p>",A

Uremic complications typically arise during which of the following phases of Renal Failure:,Initiation,Maintenance,Diuretic Phase,Recovery Phase,"Answer is B (Maintenance) Uremic complications and Electrolyte imbalance typically arise during the Maintenance Phase of Acute Renal Failure (Also known as Oliguric Phase). Maintenance phase refers to the phase of Renal Failure in which the renal injury becomes established. It is also known as the Oliguric Phase. During this phase the GFR and Urine output progressively decrease until they stabilize at their lowest. Fluid retention gives rise to edema, water intoxication, and pulmonary congestion if the period of oliguria is prolonged. Hypeension frequently develops during this phase. Uremic complications and Electrolyte imbalance typically arise during this phase. Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CR) or Dialysis should be initiated in this phase. The oliguric-anuric phase generally lasts 10 to 14 days but can last for several more. The longer the patient remains in this phase, the poorer the prognosis for a return to normal renal function.",B

Which of the following is not included in phase I clinical trial of medicine: March 2007,Healthy volunteers,Patient with end stage disease,Epilepsy patients,HIV drug trial,"Ans. C: Epilepsy patients Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate clinical trial. The drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through Phases I, II, and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV are 'post-approval' studies. Before pharmaceutical companies sta clinical trials on a drug, they conduct extensive pre-clinical studies. Pre-clinical studies involve in vitro (i.e., test tube or laboratory) studies and trials on animal populations (in vivo) in order to obtain preliminary efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetic information and to assist pharmaceutical companies in deciding whether it is wohwhile to go ahead with fuher testing. Phase 0 trials are also known as human microdosing studies. Distinctive features of Phase 0 trials include the administration of single subtherapeutic doses of the study drug to a small number of subjects (10 to 15) to gather preliminary data on the agent's pharmacokinetics (how the body processes the drug) and pharmacodynamics (how the drug works in the body). A Phase 0 study gives no data on safety or efficacy, being by definition a dose too low to cause any therapeutic effect. Phase I trials are the first stage of testing in human subjects. Normally, a small (20-80) group of healthy volunteers will be selected. This phase includes trials designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. Phase I trials also normally include dose-ranging, also called dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. Phase I trials most often include healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment options. This exception to the rule most often occurs in oncology (cancer) and HIV drug trials. Once the initial safety of the study drug has been confirmed in Phase I trials, Phase II trials are performed on larger groups (20-300) and are designed to assess how well the drug works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers and patients. Phase IIA is specifically designed to assess dosing requirements (how much drug should be given). Phase IIB is specifically designed to study efficacy (how well the drug works at the prescribed dose(s). Phase III studies are randomized controlled multicenter trials on large patient groups (300-3,000 or more depending upon the disease/medical condition studied) and are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the drug is, in comparison with current 'gold standard' treatment. Because of their size and comparatively long duration, Phase III trials are the most expensive, time-consuming and difficult trials to design and run, especially in therapies for chronic medical conditions. Phase IV trial is also known as Post Marketing Surveillance Trial. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical suppo of a drug after it receives permission to be sold. Phase IV studies may be required by regulatory authorities or may be undeaken by the sponsoring company for competitive or other reasons.",C

Cirrhosis of liver with poal hypeension is a complication of all ofthe following except-,Wilson s disease,Hemochromatosi,Gilbe's syndrome,Hepatitis C,"Gilbe's syndrome Gilbe's syndrome is by far the most common inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism . It is an autosomal recessive trait when caused by a mutation in the promoter region of the gene for UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme (UGT1A1), which leads to reduced enzyme expression. It can be inherited in a dominant fashion when there is a missense mutation in the gene. This results in decreased conjugation of bilirubin, which accumulates as unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. The levels of unconjugated bilirubin increase during fasting, as fasting reduces levels of UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Clinical features The typical presentation is with isolated elevation of bilirubin, typically, although not exclusively, in the setting of physical stress or illness. There are no stigmata of chronic liver disease other than jaundice. Increased excretion of bilirubin and hence stercobilinogen leads to normal-coloured or dark stools, and increased urobilinogen excretion causes the urine to turn dark on standing as urobilin is formed. In the presence of haemolysis, pallor due to anaemia and splenomegaly due to excessive reticulo-endothelial activity are usually present. Investigations The plasma bilirubin is usually less than 100 umol/L (~6 mg/ dL) and the LFTs are otherwise normal. There is no bilirubinuria because the hyperbilirubinaemia is predominantly unconjugated. Hepatic histology is normal and liver biopsy is not recommended for the investigation of patients with possible Gilbe's syndrome. The condition is not associated with liver injury and thus has an excellent prognosis, needs no treatment, and is clinically impoant only because it may be mistaken for more serious liver disease .

The recommended treatment for suspected arsenic poisoning is,Parenteral administration of EDTA,Peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis,Dimercaprol,Parenteral administration of penicillamine,"The trivalent form of arsenite (arsenic, AsO2) has al high affinity for sulfhydryl groups and binds with great avidivty to lipoic acid, one of the five cofactors of pyruvate dehydrogenase. The most efficient way to remove this arsenite is by administering a competitive sulfhydryl compound, such as dimercaprol. Chelating agents such as EDT A, penicillamine, or deferoxamine will react with circulating metals and remove them from the body.

The discharge included high concentrations of methylmercury. The bay was rich in fish and shellfish, providing the main livelihood for local residents and fishermen from other areas. For many years, no one realised that the fish were contaminated with mercury, and that it was causing a strange disease in the local community and in other districts. At least 50 000 people were affected to some extent and more than 2 000 cases of Minamata disease were ceified.

Which of the following is the most frequent primary malignant tumor of the CNS?,Glioblastoma multiforme,Medulloblastoma,Meningioma,Oligodendroglioma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent primary malignant tumor of the CNS. It usually affects middle-aged or elderly patients and most frequently arises in the cerebral white matter. GBM is a malignant astrocytoma; it is referred to as grade IV astrocytoma in the WHO classification and grade 4 astrocytoma in the St. Anne-Mayo grading system. This tumor is very aggressive; median survival is approximately 12-14 months following optimal treatment, ie, a combination of surgery and radiation therapy. Medulloblastoma, a much less frequent malignant tumor, affects children; it arises in the posterior fossa in this population. The histogenetic origin of this tumor is unceain, although it is thought to develop from immature cell precursors that give rise to glial and neuronal cells. Meningioma and pituitary adenoma are frequent but benign brain tumors that arise from meningothelial cells and endocrine cells of the adenohypophysis, respectively. Oligodendrogliomas constitute 5% of all primary brain tumors. Although most oligodendrogliomas have benign histologic features (e.g., low mitotic rate and mild nuclear atypia), their complete surgical excision is viually impossible owing to a diffuse, poorly circumscribed pattern of growth. This tumor allows a much longer survival (up to 7-10 years) than GBM, but eventually transforms into a malignant glioma indistinguishable from GBM. Ref: Ropper A.H., Samuels M.A. (2009). Chapter 31.

Which of the following is seen in Vitamin D deficiency-,Increased alkaline phosphatase,Decreased phosphate in urine,Hyperphosphatemia,Decreased alkaline phosphatase,"Vitamin D deficiency leads to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in decreased serum total and ionized calcium values. This hypocalcemia results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, a homeostatic response that initially maintains serum calcium levels at the expense of the skeleton. Due to the PTH-induced increase in bone turnover, alkaline phosphatase levels are often increased. In addition to increasing bone resorption, PTH decreases urinary calcium excretion while promoting phosphaturia. This results in hypophosphatemia, which exacerbates the mineralization defect in the skeleton. Reference : page 2466 Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 19th edition",A

Enlarged liver with Hepatocellular dysfunction seen In-,Wilson's disease,Budd. Chiari syndrome,Alcoholic hepatitis,NASH,"Pathophysiology Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton. The ATP7B gene encodes a member of the copper-transpoing P-type adenosine triphosphatase family, which functions to expo copper from various cell types. At least 200 different mutations have been described. Most cases are compound heterozygotes with two different mutations in ATP7B. Attempts to correlate the genotype with the mode of presentation and clinical course have not shown any consistent patterns. The large number of culprit mutations means that, in contrast to haemochromatosis, genetic diagnosis is not routine in Wilson's disease, although it may have a role in screening families following identification of the genotype in an index patient. Clinical features Symptoms usually arise between the ages of 5 and 45 years. Hepatic disease occurs predominantly in childhood and early adolescence, although it can present in adults in their fifties. Neurological damage causes basal ganglion syndromes and dementia, which tends to present in later adolescence. These features can occur alone or simultaneously. Other manifestations include renal tubular damage and osteoporosis, but these are rarely presenting features. Liver disease Episodes of acute hepatitis, sometimes recurrent, can occur, especially in children, and may progress to fulminant liver failure. The latter is characterised by the liberation of free copper into the blood stream, causing massive haemolysis and renal tubulopathy. Chronic hepatitis can also develop insidiously and eventually present with established cirrhosis; liver failure and poal hypeension may supervene. The possibility of Wilson's disease should be considered in any patient under the age of 40 presenting with recurrent acute hepatitis or chronic liver disease of unknown cause, especially when this is accompanied by haemolysis. Neurological disease Clinical features include a variety of extrapyramidal features, paicularly tremor, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism and dementia . Unusual clumsiness for age may be an early symptom. Neurological disease typically develops after the onset of liver disease and can be prevented by effective treatment staed following diagnosis in the liver disease phase. This increases the impoance of diagnosis in the liver phase beyond just allowing effective management of liver disease. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg896",A

What does HbA1c level in the blood indicate?,Acute rise of sugar,Long terms status of blood sugar,Hepatorenal syndrome,Chronic pancreatitis,"Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C) is the standard method for assessing long-term glycemic control. When plasma glucose is excessively elevated, it enters the erythrocytes, and glycates the amino group of lysine residues and the amino terminals of hemoglobin. This results in the formation of glycosylated hemoglobin. Since the half-life of an erythrocyte is typically 120 days, the level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reflects the mean blood glucose concentration over the preceding 2-3 months. Measurement of HbA1c therefore provides valuable information for management of diabetes mellitus.

Transmission of microfilaria in mosquito is -,Cyclo-developmental,Cyclo-propagative,Propagative,Cyclical,"Ans. is 'a' i.e.s Cyclodeveiopmental o In vector born diseases, an arthropod or any living carrier (e.g., snail) acts as a vector and transports an infectious agent to a susceptible individual, o Transmission by a vector may be of following types : - Mechanical transmission The infectious agent is mechanically transported by the vector, e.g., through soiling of feet of flying arthropod. There is no development or multiplication of infectious agent within the vector. Biological transmission The infectious agent undergoes replication (change in number) or development (change in form) or both in the vector. So, the infectious agent requires an incubation period (extrinsic incubation period) before vector can transmit it to host.

Heat fatigue - Performance of a person decreases due to high environmental temperatures. The person gets tired early d/t high temp. 2. Heat cramps - these are painful spasms of voluntary muscles following strenous work in hot conditions, These cramps are caused by loss of water and salt from profuse sweating. 3. Heat syncope (heat exhaustion, heat collapse) - It is a condition of collapse without increase in body temperature, following exposure to hot and humid atmosphere. - On examination,. face is pale, .skin cold, the temperature subnormal - The pt. usually recovers when placed at rest. Death is unusual and may occur d/t hea failure. 4. Heat stroke - (heat hyperpyrexia, sub stroke) - It is due to impairment of body's heat regulating mechanism caused by failure of cutaneous circulation & sweating, following prolonged exposure to hot, humid conditions. - The onset is usually sudden with sudden collapse and loss of consciousness. Predominant symptoms may also be seen (i.e. headache, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, mental confusion, muscle cramps, excessive thirst, excessive desire to micturate) - The skin is dry, hot and flushed with complete absence of sweating - Body temperature rises as high as 43degC (hence k/a hyperpyrexia) when body temp. rises above 42degC vasodilation occurs with decrease in blood volume leading to circulatory collapse and cardiac failure. - Delirium and convulsions may precede death. - Moality rate in this condition is relatively high. - Fatal period varies from few minutes to 3 days.",C

Azotemia occurs when-,GFR 50% of normal,GFR 80% of normal,GFR 20% - 50% of normal,GFR 25% of normal,"Prerenal azotemia is caused by a decrease in blood flow (hypoperfusion) to the kidneys. However, there is no inherent kidney disease. It can occur following hemorrhage, shock, volume depletion, congestive hea failure, adrenal insufficiency, and narrowing of the renal aery among other things. The BUN:Cr in prerenal azotemia is greater than 20. The reason for this lies in the mechanism of filtration of BUN and creatinine. Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) is decreased due to hypoperfusion which results in a propoional decrease in GFR. In turn, the decreased flow and pressure to the kidney will be sensed by baroreceptors in the Juxtaglomerular (JG) Cells of the afferent aeriole. If the decrease in blood pressure is systemic (rather than occlusion of the renal aery) baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aoic arch will be stimulated. This leads to sympathetic nerve activation, resulting in renin secretion through b 1 -receptors. Constriction of the afferent aerioles causes a decrease in the intraglomerular pressure, reducing GFR propoionally. Renin is the main effector of the juxtaglomerular baroreceptors. Renin is secreted from granules in the JG cells, and once in the blood stream, it acts as a protease to conve angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is conveed by angiotensin conveing enzyme, to angiotensin II, which, in turn, stimulates aldosterone release. Increased aldosterone levels results in salt and water absorption in the distal collecting tubule. GFR = 20-50 of normal GFR A decrease in volume or pressure is a nonosmotic stimulus for antidiuretic hormone production in the hypothalamus, which exes its effect in the medullary collecting duct for water reabsorption. Through unknown mechanisms, activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to enhanced proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water, as well as urea (BUN), calcium, uric acid, and bicarbonate. The net result of these 4 mechanisms of salt and water retention is decreased output and decreased urinary excretion of sodium (< 20 mEq/L). The increased reabsorption of Na leads to increased water and urea reabsorption from the proximal tubules of the kidney back into the blood. In contrast, creatinine is actually secreted in the proximal tubule. This generally leads to a BUN:Cr ratio > 20 and a fractional excretion of Na of < 1% and an elevated urine osmolarity Ref Harrison20th edition pg 277",C

Deep Venous Thrombosis andPulmonary ThromboembolismPULMONARY THROMBOEMBOLISM:PathophysiologyWhen venous thrombi dislodge from their site of formation, they embolize to the pulmonary arterial circulation or, paradoxically, to the arterial circulation through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. About half of patients with pelvic vein thrombosis or proximal leg DVT develop PE, which is usually asymptomatic.With increased use of chronic indwelling central venous catheters for hyperalimentation and chemotherapy, as well as more frequent insertion of permanent pacemakers and internal cardiac defibrillators, upper extremity venous thrombosis is becoming a more common problem. These thrombi rarely embolize and cause PE.Pathophysiological abnormalities include:The most common gas exchange abnormalities are hypoxemia (decreased arterial P02) and an increased alveolar-arterial 02 tension gradient, which represents the inefficiency of 02 transfer across the lungsIncreased pulmonary vascular resistance due to vascular obstruction or platelet secretion of vasoconstricting neurohumoral agents such as serotonin.Impaired gas exchange due to increased alveolar dead space from vascular obstruction, hypoxemia from alveolar hypoventilation relative to perfusion in the nonobstructed lung, right-to-left shunting, and impaired carbon monoxide transfer due to loss of gas exchange surface.Alveolar hyperventilation due to reflex stimulation of irritant receptorsIncreased airway resistance due to constriction of airways distal to the bronchiDecreased pulmonary compliance due to lung edema, lung hemorrhage, or loss of surfactantSigns & SymptomsSudden-onset dyspnea (shortness of breath)Tachypnea (rapid breathing)Chest pain of a 'pleuritic' nature (worsened by breathing)Cough and hemoptysis (coughing up blood).More severe cases can include signs such as cyanosis (blue discoloration, usually of the lips and fingers), collapse, and circulatory instability due to decreased blood flow through the lungs and into the left side of the heart.Occasionally, a pleural friction rub may be audible over the affected area of the lung (mostly in PE with infarct)A pleural effusion is sometimes present that is transudativeA low-grade fever may be present, particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarctionAbout 15% of all cases of sudden death are attributable to PERisk factorsThe most common sources of embolism are proximal leg deep venous thrombosis (DVTs) or pelvic vein thromboses.The development of thrombosis is classically due to a group of causes named Virchows triad (alterations in blood flow, factors in the vessel wall and factors affecting the properties of the blood). Often, more than one risk factor is present.Alterations in blood flow: immobilization (after surgery, injury or long-distance air travel),pregnancy (also procoagulant), obesity (also procoagulant), cancer (also procoagulant)Factors in the vessel wall: of limited direct relevance in VTEFactors affecting the properties of the blood (procoagulant state)Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptionGenetic thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation G20210A, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia and plasminogen/fibrinolysis disorders)Acquired thrombophilia (antiphospholipid syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)Cancer (due to secretion of pro-coagulants)DiagnosisD-dimer is highly sensitive but not very specific (specificity around 50%), In other words, a positive D-dimer is not synonymous with PE, but a negative D-dimer is, with a good degree of certainty, an indication of absence of a PEThe gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) is pulmonary angiographyCT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a pulmonary angiogram obtained using computed tomography (CT) with radiocontrast rather than right heart catheterization.

The most common disorder is osteitis fibrosa cystica-- the bony changes of secondary hyperparathyroidism. This affects ~ 50% of patients nearing ESRD. As GFR decreases below 25% of normal, phosphorus excretion is impaired. Hyperphosphatemia leads to hypocalcemia, stimulating secretion of PTH, which has a phosphaturic effect and normalizes serum phosphorus. This continuous process leads to markedly elevated PTH levelsand high bone turnover with osteoclastic bone resorption and subperiosteal lesions. Metastatic calcifications, such as tumoral calcinosis, can occur. Radiographically, lesions are most prominent in the phalanges and lateral ends of the clavicles.Calciphylaxis is a syndrome of vascular calcification, thrombosis and skin necrosis. It is seen almost exclusively in patients with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease. It results in chronic non-healing wounds and is usually fatal. Calciphylaxis is a rare but serious disease.Calciphylaxis is one type of extraskeletal calcification.

Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism differs in all of the following EXCEPT: March 2013,Age of presentation,Response to Levodpa,Symptomatology,Prognosis,"Ans. C i.e. Symptomatology Parkinsonism/ Parkinson's syndrome/Atypical Parkinson's/Secondary Parkinson's It is a neurological syndrome (not necessarily the specific disease) characterized by tremor, hypokinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. The underlying causes of parkinsonism are numerous, and diagnosis can be complex. The neurodegenerative condition Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common cause of parkinsonism. However, a wide range of other etiologies may lead to a similar set of symptoms, including some toxins, a few metabolic diseases, and a handful of non-PD neurological conditions The age of the person presenting with parkinsonism is significant. A 20 year old person might present with parkinsonism. Younger patients should be checked for the many causes of parkinsonism, including Wilson disease and not immediately be given the diagnosis of Parkinson 'disease'. However, Juvenile Parkinson disease can cause parkinsonism in a child or young adult. In contrast a 60 year old person might present with parkinsonism, at first be diagnosed with Parkinson Disease, then determined to have a Parkinson plus syndrome. About 7% of people with parkinsonism have developed their symptoms following treatment with paicular medications. Side effect of medications, mainly neuroleptic antipsychotics especially the phenothiazines (such as perphenazine and chlorpromazine), thioxanthenes (such as flupenthixol and zuclopenthixol) and butyrophenones (such as haloperidol), piperazines (such as ziprasidone), and, rarely, antidepressants. The incidence of drug-induced parkinsonism increases with age. Drug induced parkinsonism tends to remain at its presenting level, i.e. does not progress like the parkinson disease. Parkinson's disease/PD/Idiopathic or primary parkinsonism/Hypokinetic rigid syndrome/HRS/ Paralysis agitans It is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. Early in the course of the disease, the most obvious symptoms are movement-related; these include shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait. Later,thinking and behavioral problems may arise, with dementia commonly occurring in the advanced stages of the disease, whereas depression is the most common psychiatric symptom. Other symptoms include sensory, sleep and emotional problems. Parkinson's disease is more common in the elderly, with most cases occurring after the age of 50. The main motor symptoms are collectively called parkinsonism, or a 'parkinsonian syndrome'. Parkinson's disease is often defined as a parkinsonian syndrome that is idiopathic (having no known cause),",C

Ten to twenty percent of patients with adrenal insufficiency will have mild hypercalcemia; hypocalcemia is not expected. Complete blood count can reveal a normocytic anemia, relative lymphocytosis, and a moderate eosinophilia. Microcytic anemia would suggest an iron disorder or thalassemia if the mean corpuscular volume is quite low.

Cause of vasodilatation in spider nevi,Hepatotoxins,FSH,Estrogen,Testosterone,"Spider angiomas form due to failure of the sphincteric muscle surrounding a cutaneous aeriole. The central red dot is the dilated aeriole and the red 'spider legs' are small capillaries carrying away the freely flowing blood. If momentary pressure is applied, it is possible to see the emptied capillaries refilling from the center. No other angiomas show this phenomenon. The dilation, in turn, is caused by increased estrogen levels in the blood. Many pregnant women and women using hormonal contraception have spider angiomas, which is due to high estrogen levels in their blood. Individuals with significant liver disease also show many spider angiomas, as their liver cannot metabolize circulating estrogens, specifically estrone, which derives from the androgen androstenedione Ref - Wikipedia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_angioma",C
Most common finger print type is -,Loops,Whorls,Composite,Arches,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Loops Dactylography / Dermatoglvphies Gabon system / Finger printso Finger prints are present from birth both on epidermis and dermis, remain constant through out life and can't be altered without destroying true skin.o Finger print pattern is absolutely individual i.e. no two hands are entirety alike, not even identical twins. That's why, it is best (most sensitive and most specific) and most reliable method of identification (Quetelet's rule of biological variation). DNA finger printing may be same in monozygotic twins,o The pattern is neither inherited nor identical in any two persons. So the paternity cannot be proved through finger print patterns. However, paternity can be proved by DNA finger printing.o Loops (67% most common) > whorls (25%) > arches (7%) > composite (2% least common) are four main types of pattern.o It is accepted that chances of 2 finger prints matching 16 ridge characteristic are infinitely small (Parikh's). In practice 8-16 (Reddy) / 16-20 (Seth, Simpson) points offine comparison are accepted as proof of identity.o Locard's poroscopy method is study of microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweat gland present on ridges of fingers. These pores are permanent, remain un changed during life and are very useful when only fragments of fingerprints are available. Each milimeter contains 9-18 pores,o Criminals may attempt to multilate finger prints by applying CO2 snow, corrosive agents, burns or eroding against hard surface. But these manners do not destroy finger prints permanently unless true skin is completely destroyed.",A
"Arterial blood gas analysis of a patient reveals-pH 7.2, HCO3 36 mmol/L pCO2 60 mm of Hg. The abnormality is -",Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis,Respiratory acidosis,Respiratory alkalosis with,Respiratory acidosis with metabolic acidosis,"In this patient
pH → decreased (acidosis) N → 7.4
HCO3- → Increased (N → 24 mm Hg ± 2)
PCO2 → Increased (N → 40 Hg ± 2 )
First step

Determine whether it is acidosis or alkalosis
Decreased pH (7.2) suggests acidosis.

Second step

observe HCO3-/PCO2 to determine the cause of acidosis or alkalosis
PCO2 is increased which indicates respiratory acidosis.
HCO3- is increased which indicates metabolic alkalosis
The abnormality which is in sync with the change in pH is increased pCO2 i.e., increased pCO2 is responsible for decreased pH or acidosis So the primary abnormality in this case is respiratory acidosis.

Third step

This step requires determining whether the patient's compensation is appropriate 
Change in PCO2 → 20 mm Hg. (N — 40, observed 60)
Expected change in HCO3- → 2 mmol/L for 20 mm Hg change in PCO2
(For every 10 mm increase in PCO2, HCO3- increases to 1 mmol/L)
So the expected value of HCO3- → 26 mmol/L
But the observed value of HCO3- → 36 mmol/L
This suggests that some other abnormality other than respiratory acidosis exists which has increased the HCO3- value to more than expected.
A disorder which increases the HCO3- concentration is metabolic alkalosis
Thus this is a case of mixed disorder, where respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis exist together.",A

Genotyping of macerated stillborn fetuses. Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1991 Mar: 164(3): 797- 800. & http://www2. marshfieldclinic.org/wissp/commonly.htmExplanation:* It is generally impossible to collect blood or to culture tissue from a macerated stillborn fetus. Accurate genotyping of such a fetus may. however, be critical for the diagnosis of genetic diseases and appropriate genetic counselling.It is particularly important to sample fetal placenta under those circumstances since these cells tend to survive longer after fetal death.Placental tissue is an ideal sampling site in a macerated fetus.Maceration:It is a process of aseptic autolysis.This occurs when the dead fetus remains in utero for about 3-4 days surrounded by amniotic fluid without air.Signs of maceration are not seen if child is born within 24 hours after death.If air enters the amniotic fluid after the death of fetus, putrefaction occurs instead of maceration.The earliest sign of maceration - Skin slippage (Seen after 12 hours of death of child).Spalding's Sign:Loss of alignment and overriding of the bones of the cranial vault occurs due to shrinkage of the cerebrum after death of the fetus.In early stage, there is only loss of alignment without overriding.This sign develops earlier with vertex presentation.",B

It is a granulomatous aeritis that affects any large (including aoa) and medium-sized aeries. It is commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which presents with symmetrical, immobility-associated neck and shoulder girdle pain and stiffness. The average age at onset is 70, with a female-to-male ratio of about 3 : 1. The overall prevalence is about 20 per 100 000 in those over the age of 50 years. Clinical features The cardinal symptom of GCA is headache, which is often localised to the temporal or occipital region and may be accompanied by scalp tenderness. Jaw pain develops in some patients, brought on by chewing or talking. Visual disturbance can occur (most specifically amaurosis) and a catastrophic presentation is with blindness in one eye due to occlusion of the posterior ciliary aery. On fundoscopy, the optic disc may appear pale and swollen with haemorrhages, but these changes may take 24-36 hours to develop and the fundi may initially appear normal. Rarely, neurological involvement may occur, with transient ischaemic attacks, brainstem infarcts and hemiparesis.

A boy is suffering from acute pyelonephritis. Most specific urinary finding will be,W.B.C. casts,Leucocyte esterase test,Nitrite test,Bacteria in gram stain,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. W.B.C. casts RememberThey have specifically asked about pyelonephritis, not urinary tract infection. There are three basic forms of urinary tract infectionPyelonephritisCystitisAsymptomatic bacteriuriapyelonephritisUrinary tract infection involving the renal parenchyma, if there is no parenchymal involvement, the condition may be termed pyelitis.cystitisIt indicates bladder involvement.asymptomatic bacteriuriaIt refers to individuals who have a positive urine culture without any manifestation of infection and occur almost exclusively in girls. Remember that casts can only be formed in the kidney. The presence of cast is specific for kidney. Casts cannot be formed from anywhere else in the urinary tractCasts are the only elements found in urinary sediments which are unique to the kidney.Thus whenever WBC casts are present in a patient suspected of having urinary tract infection it confirms pyelonephritis.According to Harrison 'leucocyte casts can be detected in urine of only selected patients but the detection of these casts is pathognomic'About 'Bacteria in gram stain'Bacteria in gram stain can be positive in any type of urinary tract infection whether it is pyelonephritis, cystitis, or urethritis.Presence of bacteria confirms the urinary tract infection but the exact site is detected by W.B.C. casts.Still of am not sure of the answer, because on page 251 Harrison states 'The presence of bacteria suggests infection and white blood cell casts with bacteria are indicative of pyelonephritis. White blood cells and or white blood cell casts may also be seen in tubulointerstitial processes such as interstitial nephritis, S.L.E and transplant rejection'Nitrite testMore than 90% of common urinary pathogen (gram negative rods) are nitrite producing bacteria.In the presence of infection urinary nitrate is converted to nitrite which can be detected in urine.A positive nitrite test indicates infection with nitrite producing bacteria.Leucocyte esterase testA positive test is seen in presence of WBC's in urine and suggestive of pyuria.A positive leucocyte esterase test results from the presence of WBC. A negative leucocyte esterase test indicates that an infection is unlikely and that without additional evidence of urinary tract infection urine culture need not be.Once again, make it clear'Although white cell casts may be observed in other conditions they are along with other features of UT1 specific for acute pyelonephritis ''",A

In metabolic acidosis what happens to PCO2 -,Increase,Decrease,Remain constant,None.,"The fall in blood pH is accompanied by a characteristic increase in ventilation, especially the tidal volume (Kussmaul respiration). Metabolic acidosis due to an increase in endogenous acids (e.g., ketoacidosis) lowers extracellular fluid and decreases extracellular pH. This stimulates the medullary chemoreceptors to increase ventilation and to return the ratio of to Paco2, and thus pH, toward, but not to, normal.Compensatory responses for primary metabolic disorders move the Paco2 in the same direction as the change in , whereas, conversely, compensation for primary respiratory disorders moves the in the same direction as the primary change in Paco2 .Therefore, changes in Paco2 and in opposite directions indicate a mixed disturbance.

Technically, joule burn is an endogenous burn, i.e. burns produced due to release of heat from the body, on application of electric current. Electric burns may be of following types :? 1) Contact burns : Due to contact with live wire. 2) Spark burns : Due to sparking of current, e.g. in loose electrical fitting. 3) Flash burns : Caused on being near the main power line, without actual contact. Burns result due to arcing of current from these lines. Characteristic features of electric burns are :? 1) There may be holes in clothes or shoes. 2) There is a wound of entry and wound of exit of electric current :- Entry wound : It is non-bleeding, thick, leathery, greyish white, depressed, hard and cauliflower like, known as crater formation. High voltage current may cause burns over large areas of skin, i.e. crocodile skin lesions. The skin may get coloured due to metallic pigment : green (in brass electrode), black (in iron electrode), blue (in copper electrode) and grey (in aluminium electrode). Exit wound : It is like a laceration and is bleeding. 3) Metals from electrode may melt and as small balls (current pearls) may be carried to tissue. Calcium phosphate of bones may also melt and is radiologically seen as bone pearls (wax dripping). 4) Muscles show Zenker's degeneration.

Severity of Mitral Regurgitation may be judged by,Intensity of murmur,Duration of murmur,Left ventricular S3,Loud S1,"Answer is C (Left Ventricular S3) The severity of Mitral Regurgitation may be judged clinically by the presence of left ventricular dilatation and the presence of third hea sound (Left Ventricular SJ? . These features indicate a more severe disease 'A third hea sound (S3) in chronic mitral regurgitation is usually indicative of severe regurgitation' Severity of Mitral Regurgitation: . If the murmur is harsher and has a lot of low and medium frequencies. It usually indicates a lot of flow and therefore will imply significant regurgitation. A harsh decrescendo mitral regurgitation murmur is usually indicative of severe regurgitation because the decrscendo effect is caused by early buildup of a very high v wave pressure in the left atrium resulting from a severe degree of regurgitation. Thus decreasing the gradient in late systole (If the murmur, on the other hand, is all pure high frequency and confined only to late systole. Then it must indicate a high pressure difference between the left ventricle and the left atrium and therefore only mild regurgitation). When the mitral regurgitation is severe, the volume overload on the left ventricle will be high, resulting in an enlarged left ventricle. This may be reflected in a displaced hyperdynamic wide -area left ventricular apical impulse. In addition, the hyperdynamic left ventricle will have rapid ejection. This will make the A2 occur early. Resulting in a wide-split S2. Thus, a wide -split S2 in the presence of mitral regurgitation is a sign of severe regurgitation if the wide split is not caused by P2 delay. In addition, severe regurgitation because of the volume load effect will have a torrential inflow through the mitral valve during diastole. This will set up the necessary conditions for the production of an S3 or a mid -diastolic inflow rumble. The presence of an S3 or an inflow rumble at the apex will, therefore, be a sign of significant mitral regurgitation as well. Severity of Mitral Regurgitation : Features indicating increased severity: Presence of Left ventricular S3 or an inflow rumble at the apex Harsh Decrescendo murmur with lot of low and medium frequencies Wide split S, due to early A2 (not caused by P2 delay) in presence of MR Note : Loudness and duration of Mitral regurgitation murmur does not always correlate with the severity of the regurgitation",C

All of the following statements about purificationof water are true except:,Presence of Clostridial spores indicate recent contamination of water,Coliforms must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample of drinking water,Sodium thiosulphate is used to neutralize chlorine,Coliforms may be detected by multiple tube method & indole production,"Presence of Clostridial spores indicate recent contamination of water Repeat from May 10 Presence of Clostridial spores indicate remote fecal contamination of water The spores of Clostridium perfringens survive in water for a longer time and usually resist chlorination at the doses normally used in water works. So, 'The presence of spores of Cl. perfringens in a natural water suggest that fecal contamination has. occured and their presence, in the absence of the coliform group suggests that .fecal contamination occured at some remote time' -Park 20/e, p 630 Rest of the three options are true, as explained below Bacteriological quality of drinking water (WHO guidelines) Organism Guideline value All water intended for drinking . - E. coli or thermotolerant coliform bacteria * Must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample. * Treated water entering the distribution system - E. coli or thermotolerant coliform bacteria - Total coliform bacteria . - Must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample - Must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample. In case of large supplies, where sufficient samples are examined, must not be present in 95% of sample taken throughout any 12- month period. Note - Although E. coli is the more precise indicator of faecal pollution, the count of thermotolerant coliform bacteria is an acceptable alternative. If necessary, proper confirmatory test must be carried out. Total coliform bacteria are not acceptable indicators of the sanitary quality of rural water supplies, paicularly in tropical areas where many bacteria of no sanitary significance occur in almost all untreated supplies. So it is evident that colifonns should not be detectable in any 100 ml sample except for 5% of samples of large supplies taken over 12-month period. Surveillance of drinking water quality Sanitary survey - On-the-spot inspection and evaluation of the entire water supply system. Sampling - Collection of water samples has to be done with through aseptic precaution and according to guidelines. Bacteriological surveillance - A complete bacteriological examination consists of - (1) Presumptive coliform test (a) Multiple tube method - Estimation of the most probable number (MPN) of coliform organisms in 100 ml of water Confirmatory tests: In chlorinated water, presence of coliform organism is to be confirmed by Eijkman's test: Subculturing each presumptive positive tube in 2 tubes of brillian green bile broth. One tube is incubated at 37degC x 48 hrs to confirm coliform organism Other tube is incubated at 44degC x 6-24 hrs to confirm E. coli which produces gas from lactose at 44degC. - Fuher confirmation of E. coli can be obtained by testing for indole production at 44degC. (b) Membrane filtration technique (2) The detection of faecal streptococci and Cl. perfringens in doubtful cases of faecal pollutionof water. (3) Colony count - provides an estimate of the general bacterial purity of water. Counts from the same source at frequent intervals may be of considerable value in comparison to single count. A sudden increase in the colony count may give the earliest indication of contamination. Biological examination - The microscopic organisms such as algae, fungi, yeast, protozoa, rotifers, crustaceans, minute worms etc. are called as 'plankton'. They are an index of pollution of water. Chemical surveillance: Basic tests include test for pH, color, turbidity, chlorides, ammonia, chlorine demand and residual chlorine. Complete analysis will include analysis for toxic metals, pesticides, persistent organic chemical and radioactivity too. Sodium thiosulphate an antidote of cynanide poisoning is also used in water purification: - For dechlorination to reduce chlorinous taste after superchlorination of highly polluted waters, swimming pool or spas - To dechlorinate tap water for aquarium or treat effluent from waste water treatment prior to release into rivers.",A

Which of the following will be useful control strategies to check outdoor pollution with the 'fine' paiculate matter?,Restriction on the use of two engines,Restriction on burning of biomass,Restriction of use of coal as fuel at homes,Active measures to control forest fires,"Prevention and control of air pollution The control of air pollution is ultimately an engineering problem. The WHO has recommended the following procedures for the prevention and control of air pollution : (a) Containment : That is, prevention of escape of toxic substances into the ambient air. Containment can be achieved by a variety of engineering methods such as enclosure, ventilation and air deaning. A major contribution in this field is the development of 'arresters' for the removal of contaminants. (b) Replacement : That is, replacing a technological process causing air pollution, by a new process that does not. Increased use of electricity, solar power generation, natural gas, and central heating in place of coal have greatly helped in smoke reduction. There is a move now to reduce lead in petrol which is a cumulative poison. In India also deleaded petrol is being used. (c) Dilution : Dilution is valid so long as it is within the self- cleaning capacity of the environment. For example, some air pollutants are readily removed by vegetation. The establishment of 'green belts' between industrial and residential areas is an attempt at dilution. The capacity for dilution is, however, limited and trouble occurs when the atmosphere is overburdened with pollutants. (d) Legislation: Air pollution is controlled in many countries by suitable legislation, e.g., Clean Air Acts. Legislation covers such matters as height of chimneys, powers to local authorities to carry out investigations, research and education concerning air pollution, creation of smokeless zones and enforcement of standard for ambient air quality. To prevent or reduce the usage of double engine. To decrease the nuisance of air pollution, the Government of India have enacted 'The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act' in 1981. (e) International action : To deal with air pollution on a world-wide scale, the WHO has established an international network of laboratories for the monitoring and study of air pollution. The network consists of two international centres at London and Washington, three centres at Moscow, Nagpur and Tokyo and 20 laboratories in various pas of the world. These centres will issue warnings of air pollution where and when necessary. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 774",A
Median is-,Middle most value in sequentially arranged data,Most frequently occurring value in a data set,Highest value in a data,Lowest value in a data,"The median 

A median is described as a value separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half.

It does not depend on the total and number of items.

To obtain the median, the data is first arranged in an ascending or descending order of magnitude, and then the value of the middle observation is located, which is called median.

For example, diastolic BP of 9 individuals was as follows – 83, 75, 81, 79,71, 95, 75, 77, 84. Now data is arranged in ascending order – 71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 95. Here, 79 is the middle observation that is separating the upper four values from the lower four values, so it is the median. 
If there are two values in the middle instead of one, the median is worked out by taking the average of the two middle values.
For example, If diastolic BP of 10 individuals is as follows 83, 75, 81, 79, 71, 95, 75, 77, 84, 90. Data is arranged in ascending order – 71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 90, 95
Here two values are separating the upper half of values from the lower half. So the median here is - Median = (79 + 81) / 2 = 80. 
Advantage of median

The value of the median is not affected by abnormal very high or very low value. 

Taking the example as was taken in the mean – The income of 7 people per day in rupees is as follows 5, 5, 5, 7, 10, 20, 300 = (Total 352) Here mean = 50.3, median = 7. The value of mean has affected seriously, whereas the median is not affected, and the median is more nearer to the truth. So, the median is used when the distribution of values is skewed (deviated) with some small number of very high values → median is used for skewed distribution.",A

Colloidal vesicular: Parasite dies within 4-5 years 1 untreated, or earlier with treatment and the cyst fluid becomes turbid. As the membrane becomes leaky oedema surrounds the cyst. This is the most symptomatic stage. Granular Nodular: Oedema decreases as the cyst retracts further; enhancement persists. Nodular calcified: End-stage quiescent calcified cyst remnant; no oedema.> Location: Infection can be both intra and extra axial. Subarachnoid space over the cerebral hemispheres (can be very large): most commonly located parenchyma. Second most common location is seen near grey matter (frequently seen}-white matter junction basal cisterns may be 'grape like' (racemose): most lack an identifiable scolex ventricles usually solitary cysts 4th ventricle most frequent Typically the parenchymal cysts are small (1cm) whereas the subarachnoid cysts can be much bigger (up to 9 cm): differential therefore being arachnoid cyst.

"Neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and eosinopenia are most likely associated with which of the following disorders?",Endotoxic shock,Typhoid fever,Whooping cough,Cushing syndrome,"Neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and eosinopenia are most likely associated with Cushing syndrome and the hypercoisolism associated with the syndrome. Coisol decreases neutrophil adhesion in the peripheral blood, thus releasing the marginating pool into the circulation. Coisol also increases lymphocyte adhesion in the efferent lymphatics and is toxic to eosinophils. Endotoxic shock results in a neutropenia because endotoxins increase neutrophil adhesion. Absolute neutropenia is a feature of typhoid fever, splenomegaly, and sinus bradycardia. Whooping cough due to Bordetella peussis produces an absolute lymphocytosis.

Hepatic encephalopathy is aggravated by all except,Hyperkalemia,Anaemia,Hypehyroidism,Barbiturates,"Pathophysiology Hepatic encephalopathy is thought to be due to a disturbance of brain function provoked by circulating neurotoxins that are normally metabolised by the liver. Accordingly, most affected patients have evidence of liver failure and poosystemic shunting of blood, but the balance between these varies from individual to individual. Some degree of liver failure is a key factor, as poosystemic shunting of blood alone hardly ever causes encephalopathy. The 'neurotoxins' causing encephalopathy are unknown but are thought to be mainly nitrogenous substances produced in the gut, at least in pa by bacterial action. These substances are normally metabolised by the healthy liver and excluded from the systemic circulation. Ammonia has traditionally been considered an impoant factor. Recent interest has focused on g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a mediator, along with octopamine, amino acids, mercaptans and fatty acids that can act as neurotransmitters. The brain in cirrhosis may also be sensitised to other factors, such as drugs that can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy . Disruption of the function of the blood-brain barrier is a feature of acute hepatic failure and may lead to cerebral oedema.Hepatic encephalopathy may be aggravated during hyperkalemia .

In shotgun it is cylinderical. Base is of brass and rest of it is of cardboard or plastic. In rifled weapons, it is tapering and whole of it is made of brass or steel.# Center of base has percussion cap (detonator cap) which has sensitive composition, i.e. primer, consisting of potassium chlorate, antimony sulphide, mercury fulminate, barium nitrite, lead peroxide or tetrazene.# In all weapons, after firing, the cartridge case remains in the barrel and it is to be taken out manually (shotgun, revolvers, rifle) or it is ejected out automatically, e.g. in pistals.2) Propellent (gun powder)# It propels the projectile (missile) forward. It is composed of black powder or smokeless powder in the form of grains, pellets, thin cylindrical cords or flakes. Its ignition results in formation of expanding hot gases under pressure which (gas pressure) propels the projectile (missile) by providing it necessary muzzle velocity and striking energy.# The classical gun powder is known as black powder, consists of charcol (15%), Sulphur (10%), and potassium nitrate (75%). Depending on fineness, the black gun powder is designated as FG, FFG, FFFG. etc. (F = fineness). Pyrodex is another gun powder with same components, but with different ratios.# Black gun powder produces smoke, i.e. It is smoke producing powder. Smokeless powder, in addition to black powder, has nitrocellulose (single base), or nitrocellulose plus nitroglycerine (double base), or nitrocellulose plus nitroglycerine plus nitroguanidine (triple base). Semi smokeless powder has 80% black powder and 20% smokeless powder (nitrocellulose).3) Projectile (missile)# Projectile is an object propelled by force of rapidly burning gases. In shotgun these are lead shots and pellets (recently steel is also used instead of lead) and in rifled weapons (pistal, rifle, revolver), these are bullets. Tip of the bullet is knwon as nose.4) Wads# Wads are present only in the cartridge of a shot gun. Wad can be made of paper, left, card board, or plastic. These are circular disc of various thicknesses, used to adjust the contents of a shotgun cartridge.# Felt wad (wad made of felt) is imprignated with grease and this lubricates the bore (inside of barrel).",A

Which one of the following is NOT an Endocrine Myopathy?,Addison's disease,Cushing's disease,Myasthenia gravis,Primary Hypoparathyroidism,"(C) Myasthenia gravis # ENDOCRINE MYOPATHY:> Major categories of endocrine myopathy include those associated with Adrenal dysfunction (as in Gushing disease or steroid myopathy); Thyroid dysfunction (as in myxedema coma or thyrotoxic myopathy); Parathyroid dysfunction (as in multiple endocrine neoplasia); Pituitary dysfunction; and Islands of Langerhans dysfunction (as in diabetic myopathy from ischemic infarction of the femoral muscles).> Adrenal dysfunction: Aetiology of Hypoadrenalism: includes infection, inflammatory disease, and tumor. Adrenal failure may follow pituitary failure. In hypoadrenalism, neurological manifestations such as disturbances of behavior and mentation are prominent; myopathy is not likely to be a presenting finding. Factors contributing to muscle weakness in adrenal insufficiency include circulatory insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, impaired carbohydrate metabolism, and starvation. The etiologies of hyperadrenalism include pituitary or ectopic overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), adrenal tumors, or exogenous corticosteroid administration. Pituitary ACTH hypersecretion (i.e., Cushing's disease) is caused by a corticotroph macroadenomas in 90% of patients and by a macroadenoma in most of the rest.> Hypoparathyroidism causes tetany, with or without carpopedal spasm.> Pathophysiology of Hypoparathyroidism may involve either deficiency of parathyroid hormone or inability of the hormone to have an effect at end-receptors because of dysfunction of the hormone receptors.> Hyperparathyroidism does not cause tetany but results in muscle wasting and myopathy (i.e., proximal muscle weakness). The pathophysiology is over secretion of hormone, frequently from a parathyroid adenoma.> Myasthenia gravis: Fluctuating weakness of commonly used voluntary muscles, producing, symptoms such as diplopia ptosis and difficulty in swallowing. Weakness of affected muscle increased by activity. Associated with thymic tumor or thyrotoxicosis and rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus.

Which of the following is the most accurate method to assess decline in GFR during initial stages of Renal insufficiency,Serum creatinine,Creatinine Clearance,Serum BUN,Serum Urea,"Answer is B (Creatinine Clearance): Creatinine clearance is the most accurate estimation of decline in GFR amongst the option provided. Creatinine clearance is the most accurate endogenous marker for estimation of GFR to assess renal function 'Assessment of GFR is the single most impoant test of renal function in clinical practice'-Diseases of Kidney & Urinary Tract Creatinine clearance is the most accurate endogenous marker for estimation of GFR to assess renal function. Inulin is an exogenous marker that is freely faltered by the kidneys without undergoing any metabolism, tubular secretion and /or reabsorption. Inulin is thus rapidly excreted in urine by glomerular filtration and `Inulin clearance' has remained the Gold standard for estimation of GFR. Estimation of serum creatinine is the most widely used measure to assess renal function but is not the most accurate. Serum creatinine is not an accurate enough measure of renal function and can be normal in initial stages of renal failure. 'In early renal disease, however GFR can decrease substantially without changes in serum creatinine.

"Anemia is classified into mild, moderate and severe on which scale-",Interval,Nominal,Ordinal,Ratio,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Ordinal scale Statistical scales* There are following type of statistical scales to measure statistical dataFor qualitative data (Categorical Scale)For quantitative data [Metric Scale)i) Nominal scaleii) Ordinal scaleiii) Dichotomous scalei) Interval scaleii) Ratio scaleA. Categorial scale1. Nominal scale# Nominal scale data are divided into qualitative categories or groups, such as male / female, black / white, died / cured, attacked / not attacked, vaccinated / not vaccinate, urban / sub urban / rural.# Example are Race/ethnicity (black/white), marital status (married/unmarried), Religion (Hindu, Muslim/.....), country of birth (India/Nepal/....) ABO blood group, Gender (male/female), disease outcome (cured/died), vaccination status (vaccinated/not vaccinated), Types of anemia (macrocytic/microcytic), and place of living (rural/urban) etc.# There is no implication of order or ratio, means that the data cannot be placed in a meaningful order.2. Ordinal Scale# Here the data can be placed into categories that can be rank ordered (eg. students may be ranked 1st / 2nd / 3rd/4th in their class or into grades A/B/C, the activity of an animal can be rated on a scale of 1 to 6, hardness scale for water etc.)# However, there is no information about the size of the interval ie no conclusion can be drawn about whether the difference between the first and second students is the same as the difference between the second and third.# Example are TNM staging of cancers, Severity of disease (mild, moderate, severe), social class (low, middle, high), classification of person on the base of height (short, medium, tall).3. Dichotomous Scale is a type of nominal scale in which nominal data fall into only two groups eg black/white, died/cured, failed/passed.B. Metric scale1. Interval scale# Interval scale data are like ordinal data in that they can be placed in a meaningful order; in addition, they have meaningful intervals between items, which can be measured.# eg: Temperature on the Celsius scale (the difference between 80deg and 70deg is the same as between 40deg and 30deg)# However, interval scale data do not have an absolute zero, ratios of the scores are not meaningful ie 80deg C of Celsius temperature is not twice as hot as 40degC because 0degC does not indicate a complete absence of heat.2. Ratio Scale# A ratio scale has the same properties as an interval scale, however, because it has an absolute zero, meaningful ratio do exist.# eg. weights, Height, Pulse rate, serum cholesterol, blood glucose, hemoglobin level, time, blood pressure, temperature on the Kelvin scale (not Celsius scale) On the Kelvin scale, zero degrees indicate an absoluteabsence of heat, just as a zero pulse indicates an absolute absence of heartbeat.# Ratio of one value to other is meaningful. For example, pulse rate of 120 beats/minute is twice as fast as a pulse rate of 60 beats per minute, and 300degk is twice as hot as 150degk.* In this question data on anemia are placed into categories that are ordered mild, moderate, sever - ordinal scale should be used.",C

"In Wilson's disease, all are seen except",Peripheral neuropathy,Cerebellar ataxia,Chorea,Dysphagia,"Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is a rare but impoant autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by a variety of mutations in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13. Total body copper is increased, with excess copper deposited in, and causing damage to, several organs. Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton . Clinical features Neurological disease - Clinical features include a variety of extrapyramidal features, paicularly tremor, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism and dementia .Unusual clumsiness for age may be an early symptom. Liver disease - Episodes of acute hepatitis, sometimes recurrent, can occur, especially in children, and may progress to fulminant liver failure. The latter is characterised by the liberation of free copper into the blood stream, causing massive haemolysis and renal tubulopathy. Chronic hepatitis can also develop insidiously and eventually present with established cirrhosis; liver failure and poal hypeension may supervene.

Modification of putrefaction in excess of moisture such as bodies as bodies immersed in water (or damp graves and wet vaults) - Adipocere Formationn (Saponification): Transformation of fatty tissue into yellowish white greasy wax like substance (Grave Wax). Typically occurs from hydrolysis of fat with the release of fatty acids which being acidic inhibit putrefactive bacteria. - Emits a Sweetish Rancid odour when adiopocere is established (Late stages): A penetrating Ammonica odour is typical in the early stages. Modification of Putrefaction in a dry environment with no or minimal moisture (hot and dry environment like desses or inside a chimney. - Mummification: Results from drying or dehydration of tissues (instead of liquefying putrefaction). The body shrivels and is conveed into a hard, leathery or parchment like mass of skin and tendons surrounding the bone.

The best I.V. fluid of choice is-",3% Saline,N/3 Saline +10% dextrose,Normal saline,N/3 saline+5% dextrose,"Hyponatremia causes severe dehydration Clinical features Patients with hypernatraemia generally have reduced cerebral function, either as a primary problem or as a consequence of the hypernatraemia itself, which results in dehydration of neurons and brain shrinkage. In the presence of an intact thirst mechanism and preserved capacity to obtain and ingest water hypernatraemia may not progress very far. If adequate water is not obtained, dizziness, delirium, weakness and, ultimately, coma and death can result. Management Treatment of hypernatraemia depends on both the rate of development and the underlying cause. If there is reason to think that the condition has developed rapidly, neuronal shrinkage may be acute and relatively rapid correction may be attempted. This can be achieved by infusing an appropriate volume of intravenous fluid (isotonic 5% dextrose or hypotonic 0.45% saline) at an initial rate of 50-70 mL/hr. In older, institutionalised patients, however, it is more likely that the disorder has developed slowly, and extreme caution should be exercised in lowering plasma sodium to avoid the risk of cerebral oedema.

Protein present in brown adipose tissue is -,Thermogenin,Dinitroprotein,Leptin,Adipocin,"The function of brown adipose tissue is to transfer energy from food into heat; physiologically, both the heat produced and the resulting decrease in metabolic efficiency can be of significance. Both the acute activity of the tissue, i.e., the heat production, and the recruitment process in the tissue (that results in a higher thermogenic capacity) are under the control of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves. In thermoregulatory thermogenesis, brown adipose tissue is essential for classical nonshivering thermogenesis (this phenomenon does not exist in the absence of functional brown adipose tissue), as well as for the cold acclimation-recruited norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis. Heat production from brown adipose tissue is activated whenever the organism is in need of extra heat, e.g., postnatally, during entry into a febrile state, and during arousal from hibernation, and the rate of thermogenesis is centrally controlled a pathway initiated in the hypothalamus. Feeding as such also results in activation of brown adipose tissue; a series of diets, apparently all characterized by being low in protein, result in a leptin-dependent recruitment of the tissue; this metaboloregulatory thermogenesis is also under hypothalamic control. When the tissue is active, high amounts of lipids and glucose are combusted in the tissue. The development of brown adipose tissue with its characteristic protein, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), was probably determinative for the evolutionary success of mammals, as its thermogenesis enhances neonatal survival and allows for active life even in cold surroundings.

'Patterned' abrasion is variety of:,Linear abrasion,Pressure abrasion,Sliding abrasion,Superficial bruise,"Ans. is 'b' ie pressure abrasion (Ref: Parikh; 6/e, p4.3).An abrasion is a superficial injury involving only the superficial layers of the skin (epidermis only), caused by friction and / or pressure between the skin and some rough object or surface. It bleeds very slightly, heals rapidly in a few days and leaves no scar.They can be classified into 3 types, depending on the manner they are created.ScratchIs a linear injury produced by a sharp object, such as pin, thorn or finger nail.Graze (Sliding, scraping or grinding abrasion).Is produced when a broad surface of skin slides against a rough surface.It is also known as brush or friction burn because it is caused by the frictional force and resembles a burn after dryingIt is commonly found in road traffic accidents.Imprint, Pressure or contact abrasion.Is produced as a result of direct impact or pressure of or contact with some object at right angles to the skin surface.The cuticle is crushed, and the object marks a reproduction of its shape and pattern on the to the skin, therefore it is known as patterned abrasion.Example are ligature marks in hanging and strangulation, nail and thumbs marks in throttling, teeth marks in biting, radiator, grill or tyre mask in vehicular accidents.",B

Severe hypothermia characterized by all the following EXCEPT-,J waves in ECG,Tachycardia,Hypotension,Dysrhythmias,"Hypothermia is defined as a body core temperature below 35.0 degC (95.0 degF) in humans.Symptoms depend on the temperature.In mild hypothermia there is shivering and mental confusion In moderate hypothermia shivering stops and confusion increasesIn severe hypothermia, there may be paradoxical undressing, in which a person removes their clothing, as well as an increased risk of the hea stopping Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold. It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss. Commonly this includes alcohol intoxication but may also include low blood sugar, anorexia, and advanced age.Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of 36.5-37.5 degC (97.7-99.5 degF) through thermoregulation. Effos to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing. Hypothermia may be diagnosed based on either a person's symptoms in the presence of risk factors or by measuring a person's core temperature. The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing, and physical activity. In those with moderate hypothermia, heating blankets and warmed intravenous fluids are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe hypothermia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be useful. In those without a pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures. Rewarming is typically continued until a person's temperature is greater than 32 degC (90 degF). If there is no improvement at this point or the blood potassium level is greater than 12 mmol/liter at any time, resuscitation may be discontinued As the temperature decreases, fuher physiological systems falter and hea rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure all decrease. This results in an expected hea rate in the 30s at a temperature of 28 degC (82 degF). There is often no shivering, cold, inflamed skin, hallucinations, lack of reflexes, fixed dilated pupils, low blood pressure, and pulmonary edema. Pulse and respiration rates decrease significantly, but fast hea rates (ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation) can also occur.

45-year-old man complains of back pain and multiple joints pain. X-Ray shows bilateral sacroilitis. Diagnosis could be: March 2005,Rheumatoid ahritis,Ankylosing spondylitis,Psoriatic ahritis,Osteoahritis,"Ans. B: Ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease, primarily affecting the axial skeleton of which sacroilitis is the hallmark. The disease pathogenesis is immune mediated as evident by raised IgA and close relationship with HLA B27. Immunologically there is interaction between class I HLA molecule B27 and T lymphocytes. Tumor necrosis factor has been identified as key regulatory cytokine.The age of onset is second or third decade of life and males are affected two to three times more than females. The risk factors for the disease are presence of HLA B27, male sex, positive family history, etc. Of them HLA B27 is most impoant as there is almost sixteen times increased chance of developing the disease amongst HLA B27 positive relatives. HLA B27 is present in almost 90%-95% cases. The clinical features are insidious onset, dull pain felt in lower lumber region, associated with morning stiffness lasting for few hours, there may be asymmetric ahritis of other joints mainly of lower limbs. Neck pain and stiffness is present in advanced cases. Physical findings include loss of spinal flexion, extension, lumber lordosis, diminished chest expansion, and exaggerated thoracic kyphosis.",B

Renal aery stenosis may occur In all of the following except -,Atherosclerosis,Fibromuscular dysplasia,Takayasu's aeritis,Pnlviicritis nodosar,"Renal aery stenosis classically presents as hypeension if it affects a single kidney or as renal failure if it is bilateral. The hypeension is driven by activation of the renin-angiotensin system in response to renal ischaemia. In atherosclerotic renal aery disease, there is usually evidence of vascular disease elsewhere, paicularlyin the legs. Repeated episodes of acute pulmonary oedema associated with severe hypeension, occurring without other obvious cause (e.g. myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, anaemia, thyrotoxicosis) in patients with normal or only mildly impaired renal and cardiac function, can occur in renal aery stenosis. This presentation is characteristic of bilateral renovascular disease because in unilateral disease salt and water retention are paly corrected by increased 'pressure natriuresis' in the normal kidney.in younger patients (< 50 years), fibromuscular dysplasia is a more likely cause of renal aery stenosis. This is an uncommon congenital disorder of unknown cause affecting the media ('medial fibroplasia'), which narrows the aery but rarely leads to total occlusion. It may be associated with disease in other aeries; for example, those who have carotid aery dissections are more likely to have this appearance in their renal aeries. It most commonly presents with hypeension in patients aged 15-30 years, and in women more frequently than men. Irregular narrowing ('beading') affects the distal renal aery, sometimes extending into intrarenal branches. ref:Harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2455",D

Earliest pathological change is X-ray in UIcreative Colitis-,Loss of haustration,Aphthous ulcerattions,Mucosal granularity,Skip tensions,"Pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Bacterial antigens are taken up by specialised M cells, pass between leaky epithelial cells or enter the lamina propria through ulcerated mucosa. After processing, they are presented to type 1 T-helper cells by antigen- presenting cells (APCs) in the lamina propria. T-cell activation and differentiation results in a Th1 T cell-mediated cytokine response with secretion of cytokines, including interferon gamma (IFN-g). Fuher amplification of T cells perpetuates the inflammatory process with activation of non-immune cells and release of other impoant cytokines, Including interleukin 12 (IL-12), IL-23, IL-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a). These pathways occur in all normal individuals exposed to an inflammatory insult and this is self-limiting in healthy subjects. In genetically predisposed persons, dysregulation of innate immunity may trigger inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammation invariably involves the rectum (proctitis) and spreads proximally in a continuous manner to involve the entire colon in some cases (pancolitis). In long-standing pancolitis, the bowel can become shoened and post-inflammatory 'pseudopolyps' develop; these are normal or hyperophied residual mucosa within areas of atrophy . The inflammatory process is limited to the mucosa and spares the deeper layers of the bowel wall . Both acute and chronic inflammatory cells infiltrate the lamina propria and the crypts ('cryptitis'). Crypt abscesses are typical. Goblet cells lose their mucus and, in long-standing cases, glands become distoed. Dysplasia, characterised by heaping of cells within crypts, nuclear atypia and increased mitotic rate, may herald the development of colon cancer. Histology of ulcerative colitis.

Tentative cuts are seen in: September 2011,Homicidal death,Suicidal death,Accidental death,Hanging,"Ans. B: Suicidal deaths Hesitation cuts derive their name from the hesitation with which these incisions are inflicted by a person intending to commit suicide by a cutting instrument. The preliminary cuts are known as tentative cuts Hesitation cuts are not found in homicidal assaults Hesitation/ tentative wounds They are defined either as: any cut or wound that is self-inflicted after a decision is made not to commit suicide, or any tentative cut or wound that is made before the final cut that causes death. Such wounds are usually superficial, sharp, forced skin cuts found on the body of victims. These less severe cutting marks are often caused by attempts to build up courage before attempting the final, fatal wound. Non-fatal, shallow hesitation wounds can also accompany the deeper, sometimes fatal incisions. Although hesitation cuts are not always present in cases of suicide, they are typical of suicidal injuries. However, the presence of hesitation marks alongside or near to the final fatal mark usually indicates a forensic diagnosis of suicide over other possible causes of death. Hesitation wounds are generally straight-line marks at the elbows, neck/throat, and wrists, although in a few cases they occur in the general area of the upper middle pa of the abdomen (near the hea). Wounds made by people attempting suicide are typically made at an angle related to the hand that holds the weapon. The angle of such hesitation wounds is usually in a downward flowing direction because of the natural motion of the arm as it sweeps across the body. Hesitation wounds are often made under clothing, with paicular pas of the clothing being paed to expose the target area of the body. Instruments used to inflict hesitation wounds are generally those found around the living quaers of the person attempting suicide. Such instruments include kitchen knives, single-edge and double-edge knifes, pocket knives, hatchets, razor blades, screwdrivers, and other sharp objects. People who have previously attempted suicide, but have not succeeded in their endeavor, will often carry visible scars from hesitation wounds.",B
"A previously healthy 50 year old woman comes to the physician because of double vision for three days. Her temperature is 37 C (98.6 F). The patient denies nausea or vomiting. Examination reveals ptosis and slight divergence of the right eye. Extraocular movements are limited in all directions, except laterally. The right pupil is larger than the left and poorly reactive to light. Examination of the fundus fails to reveal papilledema. Which of the following is the most likely underlying condition?",Aneurysm of the posterior communicating aery,Carcinoma of the right pulmonary apex,Diabetes mellitus,Giant cell aeritis,"This patient displays signs of oculomotor palsy, with restriction of the eye movements in all directions (except laterally, due to preservation of the sixth cranial nerve, the abducens), and ptosis. Dilatation of the pupil, which fails to react to light, is a sign of intracranial compression of the third, or oculomotor cranial nerve. This should prompt search for an underlying surgical cause of oculomotor palsy. Uncal herniation and aneurysm of the posterior communicating aery are the two most common surgical conditions leading to oculomotor palsy. In the absence of clinical evidence of increased intracranial pressure, it may be assumed that the patient has an aneurysm of the posterior communicating aery until proven otherwise. Cerebral angiography is the investigation of choice to confirm the diagnosis. All of the most common medical causes of oculomotor nerve palsy result in paresis of extraocular movements and ptosis, but the pupillary light reflex is preserved. These conditions include diabetes mellitus , giant cell aeritis , syphilis and systemic hypeension. Carcinoma of the right pulmonary apex may result in Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, enophthalmos, and loss of sweating on the affected hemiface) due to infiltration of the cervical autonomic ganglia.

Presence of Ach antibodies is virtually diagnostic of Myaesthenia graves.o Sensitivity is limited to about 50% in purely occular myasthenia and about 85% in generalized myasthenia.o Definitive if positive but negative test does not rules out the diagnosis.",A
Which of the following helps most in nephrolithiasis?,Low sodium diet,Low calcium diet,High sodium diet,Low citrate diet,"Treatment of renal calculi is often empirical, based on odds (Ca oxalate stones most common), clinical history, and/or the metabolic workup. An increase in fluid intake to at least 2.5-3 L/d is perhaps the single most effective intervention, regardless of the type of stone. Conservative recommendations for pts with Ca oxalate stones (i.e., low-salt, low-fat, moderate-protein diet) are thought to be healthful in general and therefore advisable in pts whose condition is otherwise uncomplicated.

Which drug is not used to prevent contrast nephropathy -,Fenoldopam,N-acetylcysteine,Infusion of Hair normal saline,Hemodialysis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Fenoldopam Summary And Recommendations for prevention of contrast induced nephropathy (uptodate recommendation )o Optimal therapy to prevent contrast-induced acute renal failure remains uncertain. Patients with near-normal renal function are at little risk and few precautions are necessary other than avoidance of volume depletion.o We recommend the following preventive measures for patients at increased risk of contrast nephropathy, which is defined a serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL (132 micromol/L) or an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/l 73 m2, particularly in those with diabetes.o Use, if possible, ultrasonography, MRI without gadolinium contrast, or CT scanning without radiocontrast agents.o We recommend NOT using high osmolal agents is not recommendedo We recommend the use of iodixanol or nonionic low osmolal agems such as iopamidol or ioversol rather than iohexol.o Use lower doses of contrast and avoid repetitive, closely spaced studies.o Avoid volume depletion and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.o If there are no contra indications to volume expansion, we recommend isotonic intravenous fluids prior to and continued for several hours after contrast administration. The optimal type offluid and timing of administration are not well established. We suggest isotonic bicarbonate rather than isotonic saline.o Despite conflicting data, we suggest that acetylcysteine be administered the day before and the day of the procedure, based upon its potentialfor benefit and low toxicity and cost. If acetylcysteine is administered, we suggest giving 1200 mg orally twice daily rather than 600 mg twice daily the day before and the day of the procedure.o Based upon the lack of convincing evidence of benefit and ihe potential risk of anaphylactoid reactions, we suggest not using intravenous acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast nephropathy. (Note: Oral acetylcysteine is used)o We recommend NOT using mannitol or other diuretics prophytactically.o Among patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD, we recommend NOTperforming prophylactic hemofiltration or hemodialysis after contrast exposure.o Among patients with stage 5 CKD, we suggest prophylactic hemodialysis after contrast exposure if there is already a functioning hemodialysis access.",A

Increased VMA found in?,Pheochromocytoma,Tyrosinemia,Parkinsonism,Phenylketonuria,"ANSWER: (A) PheochromocytomaREF: Harrison's 18th ed ch: 343Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas synthesize and store catecholamines, which include norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline), and dopamine.Elevated plasma and urinary levels of catecholamines and the methylated metabolites, metanephrines, are the cornerstone for the diagnosisCatecholamines and metanephrines can be measured by using different methods (e.g., high-performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry). In a clinical context suspicious for pheochromocytoma, when values are increased three times the upper limit of normal, a pheochromocytoma is highly likely regardless of the assay used.Urinary tests for vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), metanephrines (total or fractionated), and catecholamines are widely available and are used commonly for initial testing. Among these tests, the fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines are the most sensitive.Plasma tests are more convenient and include measurements of catecholamines and metanephrines. Measurements of plasma metanephrine are the most sensitive and are less susceptible to false-positive elevations from stress, including venipuncture",A

Latte's crust of blood stain is used to detect -,Nature of stain,Detection species,Blood group,None of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Blood groupBlood and blood stainso The examination of blood and blood stains is an important part of crime detection. The points that are usually required to be determined regarding stains are : (1) nature of stain (whether the stains is blood or not); (2) the species (human or animal) from which the blood has come from; and (3) blood group.Nature of stain (whether the stain is blood or not)o To determine the nature of stain, following tests are used :Chemical testsThese tests are based on the peroxidase activity of haematin, which is, derived from oxidation of haem of haemoglobin or methemoglobin, present. This enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide converts colourless salts into coloured bases. Thus these tests are based on H202 and peroxidase enzyme. Tests are :Benzidine test: Greenish blue colour.Phenolphthalein test (kastle myere test): Deep permanganate colour.Leucomalachite green test: Bluish green or peacock blue colour.Guaiacum test: Blue colour.Orthotoludine test (kohn test): Blue or green colour.Amidopyrine test: Purple colour.Microchemical testsThese tests are based on property of haem part of hemoglobin to form characteristic coloured crystals. The tests are :Teichmann's haemin crystal test.Takayama hemochromogen crystal test.Luminal spray test: It is especially useful in old obscure blood stains.SpetroscopyIt is most delicate and reliable test. It is based on the principle that hemoglobin and its derivatives givecharacteristic absorption bands when viewed through a spectroscope.MicroscopyMicroscopic examination of RBCs is possible only in fresh stains.Detection of species (whether the blood has come from human or animal)o For detection of species, serological (immunological) tests are used. These tests are :Precipitin testHaemaglutination inhibition test (antiglobulin consumption test or absorption inhibition test).Gel diffusion test.Double diffusion test.Precipitation electrophoresis.Latex agglutination test.Isoenzyme method (enzymological test).Detection of blood group of blood staino These tests are :Immunological (serological) : (i) aborption-elution test, (ii) absorption-inhibition test, (iii) mixed agglutinationtest, (iv) latex test.Enzymological methods.Latte fs crust method.",C

A 55-year-old woman with non-ischemic cardiomyo- pathy presents with this wide complex tachycardia. ECG shows?,Ventricular tachycardia,Bidirectional tachycardia,Torsades de pointes,PSVT,"Ans. (a) Ventricular tachycardia.* This tracing reveals a wide complex tachycardia at a rate of approximately 150 beats/ min.* Most of the ventricular beats have identical morphologies; hence, this is a monomorphic wide complex tachycardia (in contrast to a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia where the majority of the QRS complexes have a varying morphology).* The differential diagnosis of a monomorphic wide complex tachycardia includes ventricular tachycardia or supraven -tricular tachycardia conducted with aberrancy. Several clues in this tracing suggest the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia.* When ventricular tachycardia occurs, ventricular depolarization does not conduct through the normal His-Purkinje system but rather conducts slowly directly through ventricular myocardium. During some ventricular tachycardias, sinus node depolarization continues unabated, and most of the sinus impulses meet a refractory ventricle due to the dominant ectopic ventricular activity preventing conduction.",A

True about simple randomization is: March 2011,Every person has an equal chance of selection,Also known as systemic randomization,Less number of samples is obtained,Groups are not distributed,"Ans. A: Every person has an equal chance of selection In simple random sampling, every unit of population has equal chances of being selected Randomized controlled trial (RCT) It is a type of scientific experiment - a form of clinical trial - most commonly used in testing the safety (or more specifically, information about adverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments) and efficacy or effectiveness of healthcare services (such as medicine or nursing) or health technologies (such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices or surgery). The key distinguishing feature of the usual RCT is that study subjects, after assessment of eligibility and recruitment, but before the intervention to be studied begins, are randomly allocated to receive one or other of the alternative treatments under study. Random allocation in real trials is complex, but conceptually, the process is like tossing a coin. After randomization, the two (or more) groups of subjects are followed up in exactly the same way, and the only differences between the care they receive, for example, in terms of procedures, tests, outpatient visits, follow-up calls etc. should be those intrinsic to the treatments being compared. The most impoant advantage of proper randomization is that it minimizes allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments.' The advantages of proper randomization in RCTs include: 'It eliminates bias in treatment assignment,' specifically selection bias and confounding. 'It facilitates blinding (masking) of the identity of treatments from investigators, paicipants, and assessors.' 'It permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood that any difference in outcome between treatment groups merely indicates chance. There are two processes involved in randomizing patients to different interventions. First is choosing a randomization procedure to generate an unpredictable sequence of allocations; this may be a simple random assignment of patients to any of the groups at equal probabilities, may be 'restricted,' or may be 'adaptive.' A second and more practical issue is allocation concealment, which refers to the stringent precautions taken to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups. Non-random 'systematic' methods of group assignment, such as alternating subjects between one group and the other, can cause 'limitless contamination possibilities' and can cause a breach of allocation concealment. Randomization procedures An ideal randomization procedure would achieve the following goals: Equal group sizes for adequate statistical power, especially in subgroup analyses. Low selection bias. That is, the procedure should not allow an investigator to predict the next subject's group assignment by examining which group has been assigned the fewest subjects up to that point. Low probability of confounding (i.e., a low probability of 'accidental bias'), which implies a balance in covariates across groups. Simple randomization: This is a commonly used and intuitive procedure, similar to 'repeated fair coin-tossing.' Also known as 'complete' or 'unrestricted' randomization, it is robust against both selection and accidental biases. However, its main drawback is the possibility of imbalanced group sizes in small RCTs. It is therefore recommended only for RCTs with over 200 subjects. Restricted randomization: To balance group sizes in smaller RCTs, some form of 'restricted' randomization is recommended. The major types of restricted randomization used in RCTs are: Permuted-block randomization or blocked randomization: a 'block size' and 'allocation ratio' (number of subjects in one group versus the other group) are specified, and subjects are allocated randomly within each block. Adaptive biased-coin randomization methods (of which urn randomization is the most widely-known type)",A
All are true regarding point-source epidemic except?,All cases occur abruptly and simultaneously,Children are most commonly affected,Occurs within a specified period,No secondary waves,"Ans. is b i.e., Children are most commonly involved o The main aim of descriptive epidemiology is to study the distribution of disease in time, place and person. Time distribution o There are three kinds of time trends or fluctuations in disease occurence :? A. Sho term fluctuations epidemics B. Secular trends or long term fluctuations C. Periodic fluctuation Sho term fluctuation o The best known sho - term fluctuation in the occurence of a disease is an epidemic. o There are three major types of epidemics ? 1) Common - source epidemics a) Single exposure or point source epidemics b) Continuous or multiple exposure epidemics 2) Propagated epidemics 3) Slow (modern) epidemics Common source epidemics q As name suggests, the source of disease agent is common for all cases. q It is of two types. a) Single exposure or point source epidemics o The exposure to the disease agent is brief and essentially simultaneous --> single exposure. Because disease agent enters into all exposed persons at same time --> the resultant cases all develop within one incubation period of the disease. The epidemic curve rises and falls rapidly. Because exposure is single (simultaneous) with no fuher exposure ---> No secondary wave (no secondary case). Epidemic tends to be explosive, there is clustering of cases within a narrow interval of time. o Point source epidemics are mostly (not always) due to exposure to an infectious agent. Examples --> Food poisoning, Bhopal gas tragedy, Minamata disease in Japan, Chernobyl tragedy. b) Continous or multiple exposure epidemics o Exposure from the common (same) source is prolonged - continous, repeated or intermittent. o Exposure is not at the same time or place. o For examle, a prostitute may be a common source in a gonorrhea outbreak, but since she will infect her clients over a period of time there may be no explosive rise in number of case. Because disease agent enters into exposed person at different time --> outbreaks continues over more than one incubation period. o Example --> Outbreak of legionnaire's disease (respiratory illness) in 1976 in Philadelphia (USA).",B

"Clotting factor deficiency, which is asymptomatic?",II,V,XII,XI,"Ans. c (XII) (Ref. H - 18th/ch. 61)FACTOR XII DEFICIENCYIt cause laboratory abnormalities but no clinical bleeding. Despite dramatic prolongation of the PTT often to greater than 100 s, deficient individuals have normal hemostasis and can undergo major surgery without plasma replacement therapy. Direct activation of factor IX by the tissue factor-Vlla complex may bypass this defective step in coagulation.0DEFICIENCIES IN FACTORS V, VII, X, AND PROTHROMBIN (FACTOR H)Deficiencies in factors V, VII, X, and prothrombin (factor II) are exceedingly rare autosomal recessive disorders. Spontaneous or posttraumatic musculoskeletal bleeding or menorrhagia* can occur with these deficiencies, but hemarthroses are uncommon. FFP is the appropriate therapy.Factor XI DeficiencyInherited as an autosomal recessive trait and is especially common in Ashkenazi Jews. In contrast to deficiency in factors VIII and IX, the correlation between factor level and propensity to bleed is not as precise, spontaneous bleeding is less, and hemarthroses are rare. Many patients with factor XI deficiency present with posttraumatic bleeding or with bleeding in the perioperative period, and occasional factor Xl-deficient women have menorrhagia. Daily infusions of FFP are sufficient, since the half-life of factor XI is approx 24 h.FACTOR XIH DEFICIENCY (extremely rare)Factor XIII is a transglutaminase that stabilizes fibrin clots by forming e-amino-y-glutamyl cross-links between adjacent a and alpha chains of fibrin. Patients usually bleed in the neonatal period from their umbilical stump or circumcision.In addition to hemorrhage, these patients may have poor wound healing, a high incidence of infertility among males and abortion among affected females, and a high incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. Several drugs, including isoniazid, may bind to cross-linking sites on fibrinogen and mimic factor XIII deficiency by blocking enzyme activity. Normal hemostasis requires only 1% of normal enzyme activity; a single infusion of FFP or a purified factor XHI-rich product derived from human placenta called Fibrogammin is effective.

Which of the following is the best inotrope agent for use in Right Hea Failure Secondary to pulmonary hypeension-,Dobutamine,Digoxin,Milrinone,Halothane,"Milrinone, commonly known and marketed under the brand name Primacor, is a medication used in patients who have hea failure. It is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor that works to increase the hea's contractility and decrease pulmonary vascular resistance. Milrinone also works to vasodilate which helps allete increased pressures (afterload) on the hea, thus improving its pumping action. While it has been used in people with hea failure for many years, studies suggest that milrinone may exhibit some negative side effects that have caused some debate about its use clinically Overall, milrinone suppos ventricular functioning of the hea by decreasing the degradation of cAMP and thus increasing phosphorylation levels of many components in the hea that contribute to contractility and hea rate. Milrinone use following cardiac surgery has been under some debate because of the potential increase risk of postoperative atrial arrhythmias.] However, in the sho term milrinone has been deemed beneficial to those experiencing hea failure and an effective therapy to maintain hea function following cardiac surgeries. There is no evidence of any long term beneficial effects on survival.In critically ill patients with evidence of cardiac dysfunction there is limited good quality evidence to recommend its use Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) causes increased activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is an enzyme that phosphorylates many elements of the contractile machinery within the hea cell. In the sho term this leads to an increased force of contraction. Phosphodiesterases are enzymes responsible for the breakdown of cAMP. Therefore, when phosphodiesterases lower the level of cAMP in the cell they also lower the active fraction of PKA within the cell and reduce the force of contraction. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor. This drug inhibits the action of phosphodiesterase-3 and thus prevents degradation of cAMP. With increased cAMP levels there is an increase in the activation of PKA. This PKA will phosphorylate many components of the cardiomyocyte such as calcium channels and components of the myofilaments. Phosphorylation of calcium channels permits an increase in calcium influx into the cell. This increase in calcium influx results in increased contractility. PKA also phosphorylates potassium channels promoting their action. Potassium channels are responsible for repolarization of the cardiomyocytes therefore increasing the rate at which cells can depolarize and generate contraction. PKA also phosphorylates components on myofilaments allowing actin and myosin to interact more easily and thus increasing contractility and the inotropic state of the hea. Milrinone allows stimulation of cardiac function independently of b-adrenergic receptors which appear to be down-regulated in those with hea failure. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 467",C

Biological fixation of nitrogen most commonly occurs in which of the following of the following crops?,Pulses,Cereals,All tuber crops,Sugarcane and beetroot,"Pulses (legumes) Pulses comprise a variety of grams, also known as dhals. Most commonly eaten pulses are bengal gram (chana), red gram (tuvar or arhar), green gram (mung) and black gram (urd). Others include lentils (masur), peas and beans Including soyabean. Khesari dhal (lathyrus sativus), is consumed in pas of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, excessive consumption of which is associated with lathyrism. Pulses contain 20 to 25 per cent of proteins, which is double that found in wheat and three times that found in rice. II') fact, pulses contain more protein than eggs, fish or flesh foods. Biological fixation of nitrogen occurs. But in regard to quality, pulse proteins are inferior to animal proteins. Pulse proteins are poor in methionine and to a lesser extent in cysteine. On the other hand they are rich in lysine. Soyabean is exceptionally rich in protein, containing up to 40 per cent. In addition, pulses are rich in minerals and B-group vitamins such as riboflavin and thiamine. In the dry state, pulses do not contain vitamin C. Germinating pulses, however, contain higher concentration of vitamins, especially vitamin C and B vitamins. Fermentation also modifies the nutritive value of pulses .in that the vitamin content paicularly that of riboflavin, thiamine and niacin is enhanced. Although pulses are called 'poor man's meat', they are eaten by the rich and poor alike in India. They give variety to the diet and make the food more palatable. Ref : Park 23rd edition Pgno : 628",A

The sound produced by the closure of the mitral valve is termed M1, and the sound produced by closure of the tricuspid valve is termed T1. The M1 sound is much louder than the T1 sound due to higher pressures in the left side of the hea; thus, M1 radiates to all cardiac listening posts (loudest at the apex), and T1 is usually only heard at the left lower sternal border. This makes the M1 sound the main component of S1.

Menke's disease' is a disease of,Impaired zinc transpo,Impaired copper transpo,Impaired magnesium transpo,Impaired molybdenum transpo,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Impaired copper transpo Menke's disease is caused due to defect in the copper transpo. There is defect in the transpo of copper present in the intestinal mucosa to the blood stream. The mucosal lining of intestine contains high level of copper bound to metallothionein protein. Rather than being transporated to bloodstream, the copper remained in the mucosa and was lost when intestinal cells were naturally soughed off. Menkes disease is caused due to defect in the 'MNK' gene. The protein normally function by moving copper from the intestinal mucosal cells into the blood stream, where it is hound by proteins such as albumin and transpoed to organs and tissues. Serum copper is critical for the functioning of several enzymes Lysyl oxidase - It is impoant for the cross linking of collagen and elastin such that deficiencies lead to problems in connective tissues such as bones Cytochrome oxidase - Involved in temperature maintenance Tyrosinase - Necessary for pigmentation Clinical features of menkes disease Growth retardation Coarse hair, brittle and ivory white (result of depigmentations).

"EEG is usually abnormal in all of the following, except:",Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.,Locked - in state.,Creutzfeldt - Jackob disease,Hepatic encephalopathy,"Cerebral neurons are fully dependent on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the delivery of oxygen and glucose. CBF is 75 mL per 100g/min in gray matter and 30 mL per 100 g/min in white matter (mean 55 mL per 100 g/min);Oxygen consumption is 3.5 mL per 100 g/min, and glucose utilization is 5 mg per 100 g/min. Brain stores of glucose provide energy for 2 minutes after blood flow is interrupted, and oxygen stores last 8-10 seconds after the cessation of blood flow. Simultaneous hypoxia and ischemia exhaust glucose more rapidly. The electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythm in these circumstances becomes diffusely slowed, typical of metabolic encephalopathies, and as conditions of substrate delivery worsen, eventually brain electrical activity ceases.The presence of complexes occurring with a regular repetition rate (so-called periodic complexes) suppos a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or subacute sclerosing panencephalitisThe EEG generally slows in metabolic encephalopathies, and triphasic waves may be present. The findings do not permit differentiation of the underlying metabolic disturbance but help to exclude other encephalopathic processes by indicating the diffuse extent of cerebral dysfunction.

It is caused by Triplet repeat mutations, the mutations are characterized by a long repeating sequence of three nucleotides.
It is an X-linked disorder characterized by an inducible cytogenetic abnormality in the X-chromosome.
The cytogenetic abnormality is seen as a discontinuity of staining or as a constriction in the long arm of the X chromosome.
Because it appears that the chromosome is 'broken' at this location, it is referred to as fragile site.

Clinical features 

Fragile X syndrome is the second most common genetic cause of mental retardation, after Down's syndrome.

Parboiling is done for,Milling process,Polishing of rice,Preservation of nutrition,Storage of rice,"Parboiling Parboiling (paial cooking in steam) is ancient Indian technique of preserving the nutritive quality of rice. There are many techniques of parboiling. The technique recommended by the Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore is known as the hot soaking process. The process stas with soaking the paddy (unhusked rice) in hot water at 65 to 70 deg. C for 3 to 4 hours, which swells the grain. This is followed by draining of water and steaming the soaked paddy in the same container for 5 to 10 minutes. The paddy is then dried and later homepounded or milled. During the steaming process, a greater pa of the vitamins and minerals present in the outer aleurone layer of the rice grain are driven into the inner endosperm. With subsequent milling, even to a high degree, the nutrients are not removed. During the drying process, the germ gets attached more firmly to the grain. In addition, the heat used in drying hardens the rice grain. It results in the grain becoming more *resistant to insect invasion and more suitable for storage than raw rice. The starch also gets gelatinized which improves the -keeping quality of rice. The serious disadvantage of parboiling is the development of a peculiar smell or 'off flavour' which some consumers do not relish. Modern methods of parboiling rice have been developed by which the finished product does not give any bad odour. Ref : Park 25th edition Pgno : 665",C

Radiofrequency ablation is done for-,Ventricular tachycardia,PSVT,WPW syndrome,Atrial tachychardia,"Radiofrequency catheter ablation The definitive treatment of WPW is the destruction of the abnormal electrical pathway by radiofrequency catheter ablation. This procedure is performed by cardiac electrophysiologists. Radiofrequency catheter ablation is not performed in all individuals with WPW because inherent risks are involved in the procedure. When performed by an experienced electrophysiologist, radiofrequency ablation has a high success rate. Findings from 1994 indicate success rates of as high as 95% in people treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation for WPW. If radiofrequency catheter ablation is successfully performed, the condition is generally considered cured. Recurrence rates are typically less than 5% after a successful ablation.The one caveat is that individuals with underlying Ebstein's anomaly may develop additional accessory pathways during progression of their disease.

Autosplenectomy is feature of,Beta thalassemia,Sickle cell disease,G6PD deficiency,All of the above,"Ans. b (Sickle cell disease) (Ref. H - 18th/Ch. 104)Surgical removal of the spleen is an obvious cause of hyposplenism. Patients with sickle cell disease often suffer from autosplenectomy as a result of splenic destruction by the numerous infarcts associated with sickle cell crises during childhood. Indeed, the presence of a palpable spleen in a patient with sickle cell disease after age 5 suggests a coexisting hemoglobinopathy, e.g., thalassemia or hemoglobin C. In addition, patients who receive splenic irradiation for a neoplastic or autoimmune disease are also functionally hyposplenic. The term hyposplenism is preferred to asplenism in referring to the physiologic consequences of splenectomy because asplenia is a rare, specific, and fatal congenital abnormality in which there is a failure of the left side of the coelomic cavity (which includes the splenic anlagen) to develop normally. Infants with asplenia have no spleens, but that is the least of their problems. The right side of the developing embryo is duplicated on the left so there is liver where the spleen should be, there are two right lungs, and the heart comprises two right atria and two right ventricles.",B

Black foot disease is caused by,Arsenic,Cadmium,Lead,Mercury,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Arsenic Chronic arsenic exposure can cause 'black foot disease' a severe form of peripheral vascular disease, causing gangrene of lower limbs. Arsenic poisoning may be acute or chronic. Acute arsenic poisoning It can present in any of the two ways : Gastrointestinal type : It is the common form and resembles bacterial gastroenteritis (e.g. cholera). There is garlic adour with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and necrosis of intestinal mucosa. There is tenesmus and anal irritation. Dehydration may cause acute circulatory collapse, with hypotension, oliguria and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Fulminant narcotic form : Large dose of arsenic is rapidly absorbed without producing GI symptoms. These are giddiness, headache, myalgia, formication, veigo and death in 2-3 hours. Postmoem appearance include : Red velvety mucosa of stomach and submucous petechial haemorrhage. Subendocardial petechial haemorrhage. Fatty degeneration of liver, kidney and hea. Chronic arsenic poisoning Chronic arsenic poisoning has four stages : First stage (nutritional and gastrointestinal disturbances) : The earliest sign is gradual emaciation. There is loss of appetite, nausea and intermittent vomiting and diarrhea. Second stage (catarrhal changes) : It resembles common cold, i.e. conjunctivitis, running nose and eyes, coughing etc. Third stage (skin rash) : There is classical 'rain drop pigmentation', i.e. patchy brown pigmentation of skin. At initial stages, there is a vesicular eruption which may resemble nettle rash. Hyperkeratosis of palms and soles occur. There are white transverse bands crossing the nails, known as Mee's line, and indicate periods of arrested growth due to interference with normal metabolism. There is alopecia and exfoliative dermatitis. Fouh stage (nervous disturbances) : There is sensory and motor (i.e. mixed) polyneuropathy, with painful paresthesia of hands and feet and muscle tenderness. There may be evidence of liver (fatty liver) and kidney damage and bone marrow suppression (causing anemia and other cytopenias). Hea may also be involved.

Drug used for smoking cessation A/E-,Naltrexone,Bupropion,Buprenorphine,Methadone,"naltrexone produced several beneficial effects in the treatment of nicotine dependence. For the whole sample, naltrexone improved quit rates, increased time to first cigarette, reduced cigarettes smoked and smoking urge ratings, and lessened the amount of weight gained . In 1997, sustained-release bupropion was approved as the first non-nicotine medication for smoking cessation. The mechanism of action for this agent, originally marketed as an antidepressant, is thought to be due to its capacity to block neural reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, reducing cravings for nicotine and symptoms of withdrawal. Patients should initiate bupropion therapy 1 to 2 weeks before their quit date, staing with 150 mg once a day for 2 days, then increasing to 150 mg twice a day. The medication is staed before the quit date because steady-state therapeutic levels are reached after about 7 days of therapy. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 1209",B

An echocardiogram shows left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% without segmental wall-motion abnormality. The patient desires to keep medications to a minimum What change in his management would you recommend at this time?",Add spironolactone,Add an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker,Add digoxin,Add a calcium-channel blocker,"There is very good evidence that ACE inhibitors should be used in patients with heart failure (HF) and a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. ACE inhibitors stabilize left, ventricular remodeling, improve symptoms, reduce hospitalization, and decrease mortality. Beta- blocker therapy represents a major advance in the treatment of patients with HF and depressed systolic function. These drugs interfere with the harmful effects of sustained activation of the adrenergic nervous system by competitively blocking beta-receptors. When given with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers stabilize left ventricular remodeling, improve patient symptoms, reduce hospitalization, and decrease mortality. An aldosterone antagonist is recommended for patients with NYHA class III or IV symptoms who have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35% and who are still symptomatic despite receiving standard therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Likewise, digoxin may improve symptoms and decrease hospitalization rates in patients with HF but has not been shown to prolong life. Neither of these drugs is indicated in this patient with mild symptoms. Furosemide is used to improve symptoms but does not prolong survival. Since this patient wants to minimize medications, an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker are better first choices because they confer a survival advantage. An implantable defibrillator is indicated in systolic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% in order to prevent sudden cardiac death but is not indicated in this patient whose ejection fraction is 40%.",B

A minority of patients present with glomerulonephritis. The most common presentation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis is with epistaxis, nasal crusting and sinusitis, but haemoptysis and mucosal ulceration may also occur. Deafness may be a feature due to inner ear involvement, and proptosis may occur because of inflammation of the retro-orbital tissue. This causes diplopia due to entrapment of the extra-ocular muscles, or loss of vision due to optic nerve compression. Disturbance of colour vision is an early feature of optic nerve compression. Untreated nasal disease ultimately leads to destruction of bone and cailage. Migratory pulmonary infiltrates and nodules occur in 50% of patients (as seen on high-resolution CT of lungs). Patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis are usually proteinase-3 (PR3) antibody-positive (ELISA).Pulmonary involvement may be manifested as asymptomatic infiltrates or may be clinically expressed as cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea,and chest discomfo. It is present in 85-90% of patients. Endobronchialdisease, either in its active form or as a result of fibrous scarring, maylead to obstruction with atelectasis . Renal disease (77% of patients) generally dominates the clinical picture and, if left untreated, accounts directly or indirectly for most of themoality rate in this disease. Although it may smolder in some casesas a mild glomerulitis with proteinuria, hematuria, and red blood cellcasts, it is clear that once clinically detectable renal functional impairment occurs, rapidly progressive renal failure usually ensues unlessappropriate treatment is institutedPatients with active disease usually have a leucocytosis with elevated CRP, ESR and PR3.

Measurement of urine vanillyl mandelic acid can help in diagnosis of-,Carcinoid syndrome,Acue pancreatitis,Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,Pheochromocytoma,"Excessive secretion of catecholamines can be confirmed by measuring metabolites in plasma and/or urine (metanephrine and normetanephrine). There is a high 'false-positive' rate, as misleading metanephrine concentrations may be seen in stressed patients (during acute illness, following vigorous exercise or severe pain) and following ingestion of some drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants. For this reason, a repeat sample should usually be requested if elevated levels are found, although, as a rule, the higher the concentration of metanephrines, the more likely the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma. Serum chromogranin A is often elevated and may be a useful tumour marker in patients with non-secretory tumours and/or metastatic disease. Genetic testing should be considered in individuals with other features of a genetic syndrome, in those with a family history of phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma, and in those presenting under the age of 50 years Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 590",D

K pneumoniae is a fat, nonmotile, gram-negative rod that is surrounded by a capsule that is responsible for its invasiveness. They characteristically produce moist mucoid colonies on culture. K pneumoniae is a weak pathogen and requires a host with weak defenses (e.g., alcoholics, diabetics) to infected tissue. It is more commonly associated with urinary tract infections than with pneumonia. However, it produces a lobar pneumonia, paicularly in alcoholics, diabetics, or those with weakened defenses. The pneumonia are characterized by blood-tinged mucoid sputum, a tendency for lung abscesses, and a moality in 20% of patients. In general, K pneumonia is susceptible to ceftriaxone.

In congestive cardiac failure all are true used except-,Spironlactone,Nitrates,Nesiritide,Trimetazidine,"ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, captopril) Angiotensin conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the amount of hea-damaging hormones your body produces. They also dilate blood vessels and lower blood pressure to lessen the workload of your hea Angiotensin receptor blockers (losaan) Angiotensin receptor blockers are similar to ACE inhibitors, but they don't cause the cough that some people have when taking ACE inhibitors. Common side effects of angiotensin receptor blockers: Dizziness Changes in kidney function Combination medicines (Entresto, or sacubitril/valsaan) Entresto is a medicine that combines the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsaan with a substance known as sacubitril that causes the hea to squeeze harder and can help your body eliminate excess fluid. The effect of this combination can be more powerful than either drug alone. Entresto is usually staed after a person has been able to tolerate target doses of either an angiotension conveing enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), so this is not usually the first medicine used to treat hea failure. It is currently only used if other medicines have not improved the hea's ability to pump effectively. If you are taking an ACEI (such as lisinopril or enalapril) you will need to stop that medication for 36 hours before staing Entresto. This is very impoant; not doing so could result in a serious reaction. Digoxin (Lanoxin) This medicine slows hea rate and might improve the pumping ability of your hea. You'll get a blood test to make sure the dose you're taking is right for you. Hydralazine and nitrates (Apresoline, Nitrobid, Imdur, Isordil) Hydralazine and nitrates are often used together to treat hea failure. They dilate blood vessels so it's easier for your hea to receive and pump blood.

Which of the following is the most common type of pituitary adenoma?,Thyrotropinoma,Gonadotropinoma,Prolactinoma,Coicotropinoma,"Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause of pituitary hormone hypersecretion and hyposecretion syndromes in adults. Pituitary adenomas are benign neoplasms that arise from one of the five anterior pituitary cell types. The clinical and biochemical phenotypes of pituitary adenomas depend on the cell type from which they are derived. Thus, tumors arising from lactotrope (PRL), somatotrope (GH), coicotrope (ACTH), thyrotrope (TSH), or gonadotrope (LH, FSH) cells hypersecrete their respective hormones. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common pituitary hormone hypersecretion syndrome in both men and women.

In primary pulmonary hypeension basic abnormality in genelies in-,Bonemorphogenetic protein receptor 11,Endothelin,Homeobox gene,PAX-II,"Vasoconstriction, vascular proliferation, thrombosis, and inflammation appear to underlie the development of PAH ( Fig. 250-2 ). Abnormalities in multiple molecular pathways and genes that regulate the pulmonary vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells have been identified. These abnormalities include decreased expression of the voltage-regulated potassium channel, mutationsin the BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN -2 RECEPTOR , increased tissue factor expression, overactivation of the serotonin transpoer, trans cription factor activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells. As a result, there appears to be loss of apoptosis of the smooth muscle cells that allows their proliferation and the emergence of apoptosisresistant endothelial cells that can obliterate the vascular lumen. In addition, thrombin deposition in the pulmonary vasculature from a procoagulant state that develops as an independent abnormality or as a result of endothelial dysfunction may amplify the vascular proliferation. ref:Harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2077",A

Rupture of myocardium takes place in what duration after myocardial infarction: March 2007,First week,Second week,Third week,Fouh week,"Ans. A: First week The most often used markers are the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) fraction and the troponin I (TnI) or troponin T (TnT) levels. On the basis of the ECG, a distinction is made between ST elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). Risk Factors Older age Male sex Tobacco smoking Hypercholesterolemia (more accurately hyperlipoproteinemia, especially high low density lipoprotein and low high density lipoprotein) Hyperhomocysteinemia Diabetes (with or without insulin resistance) High blood pressure Obesity (defined by a body mass index of more than 30 kg/ m2) Stress Occupations. Women who use combined oral contraceptive pills. The most serious of these arrhythmias is ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib/VF), an extremely fast and chaotic hea rhythm that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death. Another life threatening arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia (V-Tach/VT). Different zones of the hea can become injured: - An occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary aery(LAD) will result in an anterior wall myocardial infarct. - Infarcts of the lateral wall are caused by occlusion of the left circumflex coronary aery(LCx) or its oblique marginal branches (or even large diagonal branches from the LAD.) Both inferior wall and posterior wall infarctions may be caused by occlusion of either the right coronary aery or the left circumflex aery, depending on which feeds the posterior descending aery. Right ventricular wall infarcts are also caused by right coronary aery occlusion. Electrocardiogram The 12 lead ECG is used to classify patients into one of three groups: Those with ST segment elevation or new bundle branch block Those with ST segment depression or T wave inversion Those with a so-called non-diagnostic or normal ECG. Complications - Congestive hea failure Myocardial rupture is most common three to five days after myocardial infarction, commonly of small degree. - Life-threatening arrhythmia-The re-entry phenomenon may cause rapid hea rates (ventricular tachycardia and even ventricular fibrillation), and ischemia in the electrical conduction system of the hea may cause a complete hea block - Pericarditis-In Dressler's syndrome, this occurs several weeks after the initial event. - Cardiogenic shock",A

Which of the following medication in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is an NMDA antagonist?,Entacapone,Amantadine,Ropinirole,Selegiline,"(B) Amantadine # N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors are a class of excitatory amino acid receptors, which have several important functions in the motor circuits of the basal ganglia, and are viewed as important targets for the development of new drugs to prevent or treat Parkinson's disease (PD). NMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, which composed of multiple subunits, and each has distinct cellular and regional patterns of expression. Amantadine is a NMDA receptor Antagonist that is used in early Parkinson's disease to help tremor. In recent years, amantadine has also been found useful in reducing dyskinesia that occur with dopamine medication. Amantadine is well-tolerated, but its side effects include dry mouth, constipation, bladder problems, ankle swelling and skin rash.# COMT inhibitors such as Entacapone and Tolcapone represent the newest class of Parkinson's medications. These agents have no direct effect on PD symptoms but instead, are used to prolong the effect of levodopa by blocking its metabolism. COMT inhibitors are useful primarily to help with problem of wearing-off (effect of levodopa becomes short-lived).# Dopamine agonists: These are drugs that stimulate the parts of the human brain influenced by dopamine. In effect, the brain is tricked into thinking it is receiving the dopamine it needs. Dopamine agonists are not as potent as Carbidopa/Levodopa. These are less likely to cause dyskinesia and can be taken alone or in combination with medications containing levodopa. Two most commonly prescribed oral pill agonists are Pramipexole and Ropinirole.# MAO-B inhibitors -- Selegiline blocks an enzyme in the brain thereby breaks down levodopa. These drugs have a modest effect in suppressing the symptoms of Parkinson's.",B
"A 25 year old patient with asthma arrives at the emergency depament complaining of extreme shoness of breath. He has been compliant with his medications, which are metaproterenol and inhaled betamethasone. Over the past 6 hours, his wheezing and shoness of breath have become increasingly severe. At present, his blood pressure is 136/84 mm Hg and with deep inspiration falls to 116/56 mm Hg. His pulse is 126/min, and respirations are 32/min and labored. There is retraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscles with inspiration. There are soft wheezes and poor air movement diffusely throughout both lung fields. His peak expiratory flow rate is 60 L/min, and he is immediately staed on an albuterol nebulizer and given IV hydrocoisone. His aerial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.55, pCO2 of 21 mm Hg, and a pO2 of 60 mm Hg. Twenty minutes later, a repeat peak flow rate is still 60 L/min. A repeat aerial blood gas reveals that his pH is now 7.46, his pCO2 is now 34 mm Hg, and his pO2 is 64 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",Administer IV epinephrine,Administer 100% oxygen a tight fitting face mask,Administer subcutaneous epinephrine,Prepare for intubation,"This patient is having a very severe asthmatic attack, as demonstrated by his severe shoness of breath, use of accessory muscles of respiration, and variation in blood pressure with breathing (due to establishing a very negative intrathoracic pressure with forced attempts at inspiration). The initial pO2 is markedly decreased at 60 (compared to the normal 100) mm Hg. His pCO2 is also decreased at 21 mm Hg initially, due to 'blowing off CO2' with his increased respirations while trying to get enough oxygen. This causes his respiratory alkalosis with pH 7.55. He is then treated, but the treatment improves his pO2 only slightly. Despite this, his pCO2 rises, and his pH returns toward normal. This does not mean he is getting better. Instead, we are seeing worsening respiratory failure as his ability to ventilate decreases, causing the inappropriate rise in pCO2 even though he is still very badly hypoxic. This patient should therefore be prepared for possible intubation if there is not immediate improvement. Epinephrine no longer is used in the management protocols of acute asthma because of its high rate of toxicity. Administering 100% oxygen may be an adjunctive therapy, but at this point the patient is probably saturating above 90% anyway. Ref: Corbridge T., Hall J.B. (2005). Chapter 40. Status Asthmaticus.

On examination, the patient is alert and oriented. Neurological examination is nonfocal. Cardiac examination is unremarkable, without murmur, gallop, or jugular distention. ECG shows nonspecific ST and T wave changes and a prolonged QT interval (QTc of 540 milliseconds). What is the best initial management approach?","Admit the patient for telemetry, check serum electrolytes including potassium and magnesium levels, and withhold all medications",Admit for permanent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD),Admit and begin amiodarone infusion,Refer for genetic counseling,"This patient's ECG reveals significant QT prolongation (QTc>460mm). The syncopal episode was likely related to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (torsades de pointes). Both quetiapine and ciprofloxacin can prolong the QT interval; in combination with possible hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia from HCTZ, this could have caused life-threatening polymorphic VT. The patient should be admitted for telemetry, and any electrolyte abnormality promptly treated. If the patient's QT remains prolonged, beta-blockers can be started and the patient can be assessed for ICD placement.An ICD is indicated in patients with symptomatic sustained (>30 seconds) ventricular tachycardia and in patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death (especially patients who have symptomatic heart failure and LVEF under 35%). ICD implantation would be premature in this patient until reversible abnormalities are corrected. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic that blocks cardiac potassium channels. It is used to treat ventricular fibrillation and sustained monomorphic VT but is less effective than IV magnesium and beta-blockers in polymorphic VT. Genetic counseling would be considered if the patient is found to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or one of the congenital prolonged QT syndromes.

Hepatits C is associated with all except -,PAN,Dermatomyositis like syndrome,Lichen planus,Psoriasis,"Hepatitis C This is caused by an RNA flavivirus. Acute symptomatic infection with hepatitis C is rare. Most individuals are unaware of when they became infected and are identified only when they develop chronic liver disease. Eighty per cent of individuals exposed to the virus become chronically infected and late spontaneous viral clearance is rare. There is no active or passive protection against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C infection is usually identified in asymptomatic individuals screened because they have risk factors for infection, such as previous injecting drug use , or have incidentally been found to have abnormal liver blood tests. Although most people remain asymptomatic until progression to cirrhosis occurs, fatigue can complicate chronic infection and is unrelated to the degree of liver damage. Hepatitis C is the most common cause of what used to be known as 'non-A, non-B hepatitis'. If hepatitis C infection is left untreated, progression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis occurs over 20-40 years. Risk factors for progression include male gender, immunosuppression (such as co-infection with HIV), prothrombotic states and heavy alcohol misuse. Not everyone with hepatitis C infection will necessarily develop cirrhosis but approximately 20% do so within 20 years. Once cirrhosis has developed, the 5- and 10-year survival rates are 95% and 81%, respectively. One-quaer of people with cirrhosis will develop complications within 10 years and, once complications such as ascites develop, the 5-year survival is around 50%. Once cirrhosis is present, 2-5% per year will develop primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Investigations Serology and virology - The HCV genome encodes a large polypeptide precursor that is modified post-translationally to at least ten proteins, including several antigens that give rise to antibodies in an infected person; these are used in diagnosis. It may take 6-12 weeks for antibodies to appear in the blood following acute infection, such as a needlestick injury. In these cases, hepatitis C RNA can be identified in the blood as early as 2-4 weeks after infection. Active infection is confirmed by the presence of serum hepatitis C RNA in anyone who is antibody-positive. Anti-HCV antibodies persist in serum even after viral clearance, whether spontaneous or post-treatment. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg877",A

Which of the following characteristics is not of much importance in a screening test,Low cost,High safety margin,High sensitivity,High specificity,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. High specificity All are important attributes of screening test but among them high specificity is less important as Park states - ''Screening test is not intended to be a diagnostic test. It is only an initial examination. Those who are found to have positive test results are referred to a physician for further diagnostic work-up & treatment. High specificity is a necessary attribute for a diagnostic test.Below are given the differences between screening and diagnostic tests. Screening testDiagnostic test1.Done on apparently healthy (asymptomatic)Done on those with indications or sick2.Applied to groupsApplied to single patients, all diseases are considered3.Test results are arbitrary and finalDiagnosis is not final but modified in light of new evidence, diagnosis is the sum of all evidence4.Based on one criterion or cut-off point (e.g., diabetes)Based on evaluation of a number of symptoms, signs and laboratory findings5.Less accurateMore accurate6.Less expensiveMore expensive7.Not a basis for treatmentUsed as a basis for treatment8.The initiative comes from the investigator or agency providing careThe initiative comes from a patient with a complaintCriteria for Screening test- acceptability- safety- repeatability- rapidity- validity- ease of administration- simplicity- low costScreening test must satisfy the criteria ofAcceptabilityConsidering that screening tests are applied on asymptomatic people in large numbers, a high rate of people cooperation is needed. Thus the tests should be acceptable to the people. In general, tests that are painful, discomforting or embarrassing (eg. rectal or vaginal examinations) are not likely to be acceptable to the population in mass campaigns.Repeatability (Precision or reproducibility)means that the test must give consistent results when repeated more than once on the same individual or material under the same conditions.Low costA screening should be inexpensive. As a screening test has to be applied on millions of people to identify a small percentage who have early disease or its precursors, an expensive test however good, cannot justify use of restricted financial resources that has to be used for further diagnostic workup and t/t of those screened on positives.High safety marginThis is an attribute of any test, whether diagnostic or screening. Moreover for screening as screening tests are to be applied on millions of asymptomatic people and any adverse effect would bring whole process into disrepute.ValidityIt expresses the ability of a test to separate or distinguish those who have the disease from those who do notValidity has two components - sensitivity & specificityAn ideal screening test should be both highly sensitive and highly specific. But this is seldom possible and a compromise has always to be made.",D

Which of the following is the most common 5081. functioning pancreatic islet cell tumour ?,Gastrinoma,Glucagonoma,Insulinoma,Vipoma,"Gastroenteropancreatic NETs arise in organs that are derived embryologically from the gastrointestinal tract. Most commonly, they occur in the small bowel but they can also arise elsewhere in the bowel, pancreas, thymus and bronchi. The term 'carcinoid' is often used when referring to non-pancreatic gastroenteropancreatic NETs because, when initially described, they were thought to behave in an indolent fashion compared with conventional cancers. It is now recognised that there is a wide spectrum of malignant potential for all NETs; some are benign (most insulinomas and appendiceal carcinoid tumours), while others have an aggressive clinical course with widespread metastases (small-cell carcinoma of the lung). The majority of gastroenteropancreatic NETs behave in an intermediate manner, with relatively slow growth but a propensity to invade and metastasise to remote organs, especially the liver Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 517",C

A: Remote fecal pollution Nitrates and nitrites are indicators of remote and recent fecal pollution respectively. An increase of nitrates in water is often associated with farming feilizer, pesticide or poor sanitary activities. The WHO guideline for nitrates in drinking water is established to prevent methaemoglobinaemia (blue babies), which is lethal in babies. It can be potentially hazardous with health risks for considerable groups of people and depends on the conversion of nitrates to nitrites and wells which were shallow, dug of located on large farms, or springs were more likely to have elevated concentrations of nitrates. Contamination of drinking water by nitrates is an evolving public health concern since nitrates can undergo endogenous reduction to nitrites (nitrate (III)), and nitrosation of nitrites can form N-nitrose compounds, which are potent carcinogens.",A

"A neurological examination of a 47 year old woman reveals a normal corneal reflex in her right eye, but no consensual corneal reflex in her left eye. Which of the following additional findings might be expected?",Absence of pupillary light reflex of the left eye,Hyperacusis of the left ear,Inability to abduct the right eye,Loss of pain and temperature of the left face,"The first trick to this question is to determine where the lesion is. The corneal reflex is tested by touching a cotton wisp to the eye. A normal response would be blinking of the ipsilateral eye as well as the contralateral eye (consensual reflex). The afferent limb of the corneal reflex is contained within the ophthalmic division of the ipsilateral ophthalmic nerve (V1), the efferent limb is by both (right and left) facial nerves (VII). This woman had a normal corneal reflex in her right eye, indicating a normal right V1 and right VII. However, she lacked a consensual reflex, indicating an abnormal left VIIth nerve. The next trick to this question is to determine what other signs a lesion in the left VIIth nerve could produce. A lesion in the left VIIth would also produce hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to sound) in the left ear because of paralysis of the stapedius muscle, which ordinarily dampens sound transmission through the middle ear. The absence of a pupillary light reflex of the left eye could be caused either by a lesion of the left optic nerve (CN II; afferent limb) or by a lesion of the left oculomotor nerve (CN III; efferent limb). The inability to abduct the right eye could be caused by a lesion of the right abducens nerve (CN VI), which innervates the lateral rectus muscle. Loss of pain and temperature of the left face could be caused by a lesion of the spinal nucleus of V. This nucleus is located in the medulla, and receives pain and temperature information from the face the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Ref: Rosenga A.J., Novakovic R.L., Frank J.I. (2005). Chapter 67.

Which of the following is true about CML in children?,Translocation between long arm of chromosome 9 and sho arm of chromosome 22,Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used in treatment,Commonly presents as blast crisis,2nad most common leukemia in children,"small percentage of patients diagnosed with CML are children and young adults. CML represents about 3 percent of newly diagnosed childhood leukemias. The treatment of children with CML is not standardized. It often follows guidelines developed for adults, even though there are differences between CML in children and adults in terms of disease presentation and progression. Some studies indicate that children and young adult patients have lower rates of complete cytogenetic and major molecular responses compared with older adults. Children and young adults might have a slightly higher risk of transformation to accelerated and blast phase. Children with CML should be treated by pediatric hematologist-oncologists (doctors who specialize in treating pediatric patients with blood cancer). The following TKI drugs are approved to treat CML in children: Imatinib (Gleevec(r)) Dasatinib (Sprycel(r)) Nilotinib (Tasigna(r)) Since children with CML may receive TKI therapy for much longer than adults and during periods of active growth, follow-up care is very impoant. In addition to testing their pediatric patients' responses to therapy, doctors should also monitor children's Height and weight--Doctors should consider a bone scan and a bone density scan if there is evidence of abnormal growth. Pubey--Doctors should refer patients to an endocrinologist if there is a delay in pubey. Thyroid function Hea--Patients should have an annual echocardiogram. Poor adherence to therapy, paicularly in adolescents and young adults, is an additional concern. With oral TKIs, it is impoant to follow the doctor's directions and keep taking the medication for as long as prescribed. Nonadherence to TKI treatment is known to increase the risk of lower response or possibly treatment failure. Taking into account the potential concerns of lifelong TKI treatment, researchers are studying stopping TKIs after a period of deep molecular response. Treatment-free remission is now considered a goal of treatment for selected patients and is a focus of study in various ongoing clinical trials. Intermittent TKI dosing is another potential method to reduce long-term side effects in pediatric CML patients, but more studies are needed to evaluate this approach. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is another treatment option. Because there have been no randomized controlled trials comparing stem cell transplantation and imatinib in children due to the small number of pediatric patients, the decision on how to treat CML has been individualized. Stem cell transplantation should be evaluated against the complications associated with lifelong TKI use. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 922",B

"A patient with salicylic acid poisoning has the following arterial blood gas analysis report: pH is 7.12 , PCO2 is 18 mm Hg HCO3– is 12 mmol/L. The resulting acid-base abnormality can be best labelled",Metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis,Metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis,Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis,Metabolic acidosis,"First step

Determine whether it is acidosis or alkalosis
Low pH (7.2) means that it is acidosis

Second step

Observe HCO3-/ CO2 to determine the cause of acidosis or a decrease in pH
Decreased PCO2 means respiratory alkalosis
Decreased HCO3- means metabolic acidosis
The abnormality which is in sync with the change in pH, i.e., the abnormality which is causing acidosis is decreased HCO3- So, the primary abnormality in the case is metabolic acidosis

Third step

The third step requires determining whether the patient's compensation is appropriate or not.
Refer to the table
Change in HCO3- →12 mmol / L
Expected change in PCO2 → 1.25 x 12 mmol =15 for 12 mmol change in HCO3-
 (PaCO2 is expected to decrease 1.25 mm Hg for each mmol/L decrease in HCO3-)

"All are true regarding Early Post-cibal syndrome, except",Distension of abdomen,Managed conservatively,Hypermotility of intestine is common,Surgery is usually indicated,"Early dumping takes place 15-30 min after meals and consists of crampy abdominal discomfo, nausea, diarrhea, belching, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, light-headedness, and, rarely, syncope. These signs and symptoms arise from the rapid emptying of hyperosmolar gastric contents into the small intestine, resulting in a fluid shift into the gut lumen with plasma volume contraction and acute intestinal distention. Release of vasoactive GI hormones (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neurotensin, motilin) is also theorized to play a role in early dumping . Treatment Dietary modification is the cornerstone of therapy for patients with dumping syndrome. Small, multiple (six) meals devoid of simple carbohydrates coupled with elimination of liquids during meals is impoant. Antidiarrheals and anticholinergic agents are complementary to diet. Guar and pectin, which increase the viscosity of intraluminal contents, may be beneficial in more symptomatic individuals. Acarbose, an a-glucosidase inhibitor that delays digestion of ingested carbohydrates, has also been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of the late phases of dumping. The somatostatin analogue octreotide has been successful in diet-refractory cases. This drug is administered subcutaneously (50 mg tid), titrated according to clinical response. A long-acting depot formulation of octreotide can be administered once every 28 days and provides symptom relief comparable to the sho-acting agent. In addition, patient weight gain and quality of life appear to be superior with the long-acting form. Ref - Harrison's internal medicine 20e pg 2237",D

Increased plasma concentration of calcium is associated with: March 2009,Rickets,Osteomalacia,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Pseudohypoparathyroidism,"Ans. C: Primary hyperparathyroidism The most common cause of high calcium levels (hypercalcemia) is an overproduction of parathyroid hormone, or hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism tends to be more common in women, and occurs in 25 out of every 100,000 individuals. Hyperparathyroidism can be the result of all four parathyroid glands producing an excessive amount of parathyroid hyperplasia (PTH), or the result of just one gland specifically producing an excessive amount of PTH (usually the result of a parathyroid adenoma or benign tumor). Other conditions associated with hypercalcemia include: Cancers, paicularly multiple myeloma, breast cancer and lung cancer; Excessive levels of vitamin D from vitamins, excessive dietary calcium, or from diseases that may result in excess vitamin D production; Immobilization over a long period of time; Kidney failure; Overactive thyroid (hypehyroidism) or excessive thyroid hormone intake; and Use of ceain medications such as thiazide diuretics.

The following tests may be useful in the assessment of a patient with sarcoidosis,Chest X-ray,ACE,Serum calcium,All of the above,"Investigations in Sarcoidosis Lymphopenia is characteristic and liver function tests may be mildly deranged. Hypercalcaemia may be present (reflecting increased formation of calcitriol - 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D - by alveolar macrophages), paicularly if the patient has been exposed to strong sunlight. Hypercalciuria may also be seen and may lead to nephrocalcinosis. Serum angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE may provide a non-specific marker of disease activity and can assist in monitoring the clinical course. Chest radiography has been used to stage sarcoid . In patients with pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary function testing may show a restrictive defect accompanied by impaired gas exchange. Exercise testsmay reveal oxygen desaturation. Bronchoscopy may demonstrate a 'cobblestone' appearance of the mucosa, and bronchial and transbronchial biopsies usually show non-caseating granulomas, as may samples from the mediastinal nodes obtained by EBUS. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid typically contains an increased CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio. Characteristic HRCT appearances include reticulonodular opacities that follow a perilymphatic distribution centred on bronchovascular bundles and the subpleural areas. PET scanning can detect extrapulmonary disease. The occurrence of erythema nodosum with BHL on chest X-ray is often sufficient for a confident diagnosis, without recourse to a tissue biopsy. Similarly, a typical presentation with classical HRCT features may also be accepted. In other instances, however, the diagnosis should be confirmed by histological examination of the involved organ. The presence of anergy (e.g. to tuberculin skin tests) may suppo the diagnosis. Ref - Davidsons 23e p632",D

Calcium oxalate crystals found in urine in poisoning due to: (PGI June 2007),Ethanol,Methanol,Ethylene glycol poisoning,Dhatura poisoning,"Ans.: C (Ethylene glycol poisoning) Ethylene Glycol Poisoning Harrison 17th/291Ingestion of ethylene glycol (commonly used in antifreeze) leads to a metabolic acidosis and severe damage to the central nervous system, heart, lungs, and kidneys. The increased AG and osmolar gap are attributable to ethylene glycol and its metabolites, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, and other organic acids. Lactic acid production increases secondary to inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and altered intracellular redox state.Diagnosis is facilitated by recognizing oxalate crystals in the urine, the presence of an osmolar gap in serum, and a high-AG acidosis.If antifreeze containing a fluorescent dye is ingested, a Wood's lamp applied to the urine may be revealing.Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting measurement of ethylene glycol levels in this setting",C

The acid base status of a patient reveals a pH=7.46 and pCO2=30 mm Hg. The patient has a paially compensated primary-,Metabolic acidosis,Metabolic alkalosis,Respiratory alkalosis,Respiratory acidosis,"Respiratory alkalosis Respiratory alkalosis develops when there is a period of sustained hyperventilation, resulting in a reduction of PCO2 and increase in plasma pH. If the condition is sustained, renal compensation occurs, such that tubular acid secretion is reduced and the plasma bicarbonate falls. Respiratory alkalosis is usually of sho duration, occurring in anxiety states or as the result of over-vigorous assisted ventilation. It can be prolonged in the context of pregnancy, pulmonary embolism, chronic liver disease, and ingestion of ceain drugs such as salicylates that directly stimulate the respiratory centre in the brainstem. Clinical features are those of the underlying cause but agitation associated with perioral and digital tingling may also occur, as alkalosis promotes the binding of calcium to albumin, resulting in a reduction in ionised calcium concentrations. In severe cases, Trousseau's sign and Chvostek's sign may be positive, and tetany or seizures may develop (p. 663). Management involves correction of identifiable causes, reduction of anxiety, and a period of rebreathing into a closed bag to allow CO2 levels to rise. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 367",C
Which of the following is associated with hypothyroidism in Himalayan region?,Cu,Fe,Zn,Selenium,"Answer is D (Selenium): Hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (2013) Hypothyroidism in Himalayan region is associated with Iodine Deficiency and Selenium deficiency. Selenium is a trace element that plays a role in thyroid hormone production, as it forms pa of a seleno-enzyme responsible for conveing T4 into T3. Selenium deficiency as a causative factor for Hypothyroidism and Goitre formation has been explained by diminished activity of selenocysteine enzymes in thyroid, notably glutathione peroxidase and deiodinase type-1. Type-1 deiodinase enzyme is required for conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues.

The increase in weight is not constant and is not a reliable indication of breathing. Fodere&;s test: The lung are ligated across their hila and separated. THe average weight of the both lungs before respiration varies from 30g to 40g, and after respiration from 60g to 66g. The increase in weight is due to the increased flow of blood. Raygat's test/hydrostatic test:The hydrostatic test is based on the principle that if the infant has breathed, the lung will float in water. each lung is cut into pieces and tested for floataion in water. A piece of liver is used as control. if the liver bit floats, the test has no meaning, it is clear that putrefaction has set in. If all the pieces of lung float, they are crushed under a weight and tested again. flaotion is positive when the baby has respired.

Time difference between screening test and standard test is known as -,Lead time,Generation time,CIP,Lag time,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Lead time o In respect to screening test and diagnostic test, a disease passes through following phase, sequentially. i) Disease onset --> Disease process just staed. ii) First possible point of diagnosis The earliest point in disease process where a diagnosis can be made, i.e., before this point diagnosis can not be made by any test. iii) Final critical point of diagnosis --> The point after which even diagnosis and treatment will not change the outcome. iv)Usual time of diagnosis --> Time in disease process when most of the people are diagnosed by usual diagnostic procedure (not screening test). o So, by screening, the intention is to diagnosis the disease between : ? i) First possible point Before that diagnosis cannot made by any test. ii) Final critical point After that treatment will not change the outcome. o The time period between these two points is called screening time and all screening tests are aimed to detect the disease during this period. Lead time o The lead time is the time period between diagnosis by early detection (i.e., earliest point of diagnosis by screening test) and diagnosis by standard diagnostic tests. o Lead time is the advantage gained by screening. Implications of lead time & Screening time o If the person is diagnosed in screening time (from first possible point to final critical point), the outcome can be improved/changed by early treatment. o If the person is diagnosed after screening time (after final critical point), the outcome will not change even with treatment. o So, though the lead time is the advantage gained by screening, only the earlier poion of lead time, i.e., screening time is impoant for screening tests. o For example if the usual outcome of a disease is death (without any intervention). Following may occur : - i) Person is diagnosed before final critical point in screening time ---> Person may survive or death may be postponed by treatment (outcome is altered/improved). ii) Person is diagnosed after final critical point, even if in lead time (i.e., poion of lead time after screening time) ----> Person will die even with treatment, at the same time (the time of death without any intervention). iii) Screening is not useful for the diseases, which do not have lead time (screening time is a poion of lead time) --> Because there is nothing to be gained by screening as the disease will be diagnosed at the usual time of diagnosis (as by standard diagnostic tests).",A

Not a cause of Gynaecomastia,Hypothyroidism,Kallman,obesity,Klinefelter syndrome,". Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hypothyroidism Causes of Gynaecomastia Pubey During pubey, the serum oestradiol rises to adult levels before testosterone, causing transient gynaecomastia. This normally resolves within six months to two years. Cirrhosis Gynaecomastia occurs due to altered sex hormone metabolism, and an increase in the oestradiol; free testosterone ratio. Hypogonadism Primary hypogonadism causes a compensatory rise in LH, in turn causing increased peripheral aromatization of testosterone to oestradiol. Secondary hypogonadism, due to pituitary or hypothalamic disease (e.g. prolactin excess, Kallman's syndrome haemachromatosis), may also cause gynaecomastia despite LH deficiency, since the adrenal coex continues to produce oestrogen precursors, which are conveed to oestrogens in peripheral tissues. Tumours Testicular tumours: Germ cell tumours account for over 95% testicular tumours. Gynaecomatia occurs in 5% of patients, due to hCG secretion stimulating oestradol production by the testes. Leydig cell tumours cause gynaecomastia in 20 - 30% of cases. These tumours present with precocious pubey in boys, or poot libido and gynaecomastia in young males. Approximately 10% of these tumours are malignant. Seoli cell turnours cause gynaecomastia through excess aromatization of androgents to oestrogens. These turnours may occur in Peutz- Jeger 's syndrome. Adrenocoical turnours may cause gynaecomastia through overproduction of androgens such as androstenedione, which are conveed to oestrogens in peripheral tissues. Ectopic hCG-secreting tumours include lung, gastric, renal, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Hypogonadism from chemotherapy or radiotherapy may also cause gynaecomastia in patients with testicular tumours. Graves disease Gynaecomastia may occur due to increased sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and decreased free testosterone levels. Chronic renal failure: Half of patients receiving haemodialysis develop gynaecomastia due to decreased leydig cell function. Gynaecomastia may also occur following kidney transplantation due to ciclosporin use. Androgen insensitivity syndrome : Complete androgen insensitivity, .formerly termed 'testicular feminization syndrome', causes a femalephynotype in patients who are genotype males. These patients are regarded as female, and therefore present with infeility and amenorrhoea rather gynaecomastia. Paial androgen receptor defects maycause gynaecomastia in phenotypic males.

Complication of blood transfusion can be all except -,Hyperkalemia,Citrate toxicity,Metabolic acidosis,Hypothermia,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Metabolic acidosis The question is most probably about complications of massive blood transfusion.Massive Blood Transfusion * Massive blood transfusion is generally defined as transfusion of one to two volumes of patient's own blood volumes (For most adults that is equivalent to 10-20 units.)Complications of Massive Blood TransfusionCoagulopathyThe most common cause of bleeding following massive blood transfusion is dilutional thrombocytopeniaClinically significant dilution of the coagulation factors is unusual in previously normal individuals.Citrate ToxicityCitrate is used as an anticoagulant in the stored blood.Citrate has a property to bind calcium, this calcium binding by the citrate preservative can become significant following transfusion of large volumes of blood or blood products.Hypocalcemia results in some patients after massive transfusion, to prevent this, the transfusion rate should not exceed 1 unit every 5 minutes.Citrate also has an affinity for magnesium ion and the occurrence of hypomagnesemia in the setting of massive transfusion is seen (rarely).HypothermiaBlood is stored at a temperature of 2degC-6degC. So massive blood transfusion can result in hypothermia.Massive blood transfusion is an absolute indication for warming all blood products and intravenous fluids to normal body temperature.Hypothermia due to massive transfusion can result in ventricular arrhythmia.Acid-Base BalanceThe stored blood is acidic for two reasons.Due to the citric acid (the anticoagulants) Due to release of metabolic products by the anaerobic glycolysis of red cells (CO2 and Lactate).Despite the Stored Blood Being Acidic, Significant metabolic acidosis due to transfusion is not common.- Once the resuscitation is complete and normal perfusion is restored, any metabolic acidosis present, typically resolves, and progressive metabolic alkalosis supervenes as citrate and lactate contained in transfusion and resuscitation fluids are converted to bicarbonate by the liver. The most consistent acid base abnormality after massive blood transfusion is postoperative metabolic alkalosis.Serum Potassium ConcentrationThe extracellular concentration of Potassium in stored blood steadily increases with time due to lysis of RBC's.The amount of extracellular potassium transfused with each unit is typically less than 4m Eq per unit. Hyperkalemia can develop regardless of the age of the blood when transfusion rate exceeded 100ml/min.Oxygen Affinity Changes * 2, 3 DPG is greatly reduced in RBC's after about 3 weeks of storage, this increases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and adversely affects oxygen delivery to tissues.Acute Respiration?

The severity of mitral regurgitation is decided by all of the following clinical findings except -,Presence of mid- diastolic murmur across mitral Valve,Wide split second hea sound.,Presence ofloft ventricular S3 gallop,Intensity of systolic murmur across mitral valve,"Mitral regurgitation (MR), mitral insufficiency, or mitral incompetence, is a form of valvular hea disease in which the mitral valve does not close properly when the hea pumps out blood. It is the abnormal leaking of blood backwards from the left ventricle, through the mitral valve, into the left atrium, when the left ventricle contracts, i.e. there is regurgitation of blood back into the left atrium.MR is the most common form of valvular hea disease.severity is determined by intensity of systolic murmer across mitral valve The degree of severity of MR can be quantified by the regurgitant fraction, which is the percentage of the left ventricular stroke volume that regurgitates into the left atrium. regurgitant fraction = {\displaystyle {\frac {V_{mitral}-V_{aoic}}{V_{mitral}}}\times 100\%} \frac{V_{mitral} - V_{aoic}} {V_{mitral}} \times 100\% where Vmitral and Vaoic are, respectively, the volumes of blood that flow forward through the mitral valve and aoic valve during a cardiac cycle. Methods that have been used to assess the regurgitant fraction in mitral regurgitation include echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, fast CT scan, and cardiac MRI. The echocardiographic technique to measure the regurgitant fraction is to determine the forward flow through the mitral valve (from the left atrium to the left ventricle) during ventricular diastole, and comparing it with the flow out of the left ventricle through the aoic valve in ventricular systole. This method assumes that the aoic valve does not suffer from aoic insufficiency. Another way to quantify the degree of MR is to determine the area of the regurgitant flow at the level of the valve. This is known as the regurgitant orifice area, and correlates with the size of the defect in the mitral valve. One paicular echocardiographic technique used to measure the orifice area is measurement of the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA). The flaw of using PISA to determine the mitral valve regurgitant orifice area is that it measures the flow at one moment in time in the cardiac cycle, which may not reflect the average performance of the regurgitant jet.

All the following have been shown to reduce the risk of atherothrombotic stroke in primary or secondary prevention EXCEPT:,Aspirin,Blood pressure control,Clopidogrel,Warfarin,"Numerous studies have identified key risk factors for ischemic stroke. Old age, family history, diabetes, hypertension, tobacco smoking, and cholesterol are all risk factors for atherosclerosis and therefore stroke. Hypertension is the most significant among these risk factors. All cases of hypertension must be controlled in the setting of stroke prevention. Antiplatelet therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of vascular atherothrombotic events. The overall relative risk reduction of nonfatal stroke is about 25 to 30% across most large clinical trials. The “true” absolute benefit is dependent on the individual patient’s risk; therefore, patients with a low risk for stroke (e.g., younger, with minimal cardiovascular risk factors) may have a relative risk reduction with antiplatelet therapy but a meaningless “benefit.” Numerous studies have shown the benefit of statin therapy in the reduction of stroke risk even in the absence of hypercholesterolemia.

Excitotoxicity is due to the following,Nmda Exposure,Ampa,Kainite Exposure,All The Above,"(D) All The Above # EXCITOTOXICITY:> Low Ca2+ buffering and excitotoxicity under physiological stress and pathophysiological conditions in motor neuron (MNs). Low Ca2+ buffering in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) vulnerable hypoglossal MNs exposes mitochondria to higher Ca2+ loads compared to highly buffered cells. Linder normal physiological conditions, the neurotransmitter opens glutamate, NMDA and AMPA receptor channels, and voltage dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) with high glutamate release, which is taken up again by EAAT1 and EAAT2.> This results in a small rise in intracellular calcium that can be buffered in the cell. In ALS, a disorder in the glutamate recep- tor channels leads to high calcium conductivity, resulting in high Ca2+ loads and increased risk for mitochondrial damage. This triggers the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which then inhibit glial EAAT2 function.> Excitotoxicity is the pathological process by which nerve cells are damaged and killed by glutamate and similar substances. This occurs when receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (glutamate receptors) such as the NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor are overactivated. Excitotoxins like NMDA and kainic acid which bind to these receptors, as we I as pathologically high levels of glutamate, can cause excitotoxicity by allowing high levels of calcium ions (Ca2+) to enter the cell. Ca2+ influx into cells activates a number of enzymes, including phospholipases, endonucleases, and proteases such as calpain. These enzymes go on to damage cell structures such as components of the cytoskeleton, membrane, and DNA.> Excitotoxicity may be involved in spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) such as Multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, Alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal and Huntington's disease. Other common conditions that cause excessive glutamate concentrations around neurons are hypoglycemia and status epilepticus.",D

In 1997, human cases of influenza caused by avian influenza viruses 64/1/5N) were detected in Hongkong during an extensive outbreak of influenza in poultry.
All these cases were associated with contact with infected poultry.
Efficient person to person transmission has not been observed to date.
Mortality rates have been high (60%) and clinical manifestations have differed somewhat from those associated with typical outbreaks of influenza.
Transmission of avian influenza A/H7N7 viruses from infected poultry to humans has been observed in the Netherlands, resulting predominantly in cases of conjunctivitis and some respiratory illness.
Infection with A/H9N2 viruses along with mild respiratory illness has been reported in children in Hongkong.
Because of the absence of widespread immunity to H5, H7 and H9 viruses, concern has been raised that avian-to-human transmission may be the basic for the emergence of pandemic strains.",A

All are used in treatment of acute gout except,Aspirin,Naproxen,Allopurinol,Colchicine,"Acute gout Oral colchicine given in doses of 0.5 mg twice or 3 times daily is the treatment of first choice in acute gout. It works by inhibiting microtubule assembly in neutrophils. The most common adverse effects are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Oral NSAIDs are also effective but are used less commonly since many patients affected by acute gout have coexisting cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or chronic kidney disease. Oral prednisolone (15-20 mg daily) or intramuscular methylprednisolone (80-120 mg daily) for 2-3 days are highly effective and are a good choice in elderly patients where there is an increased risk of toxicity with colchicine and NSAID . The IL-1b inhibitor canakinumab is effective but extremely expensive and so seldom given. Local ice packs can also be used for symptomatic relief. Prophylaxis for chronic gout Patients who have had a single attack of gout do not necessarily need to be given urate-lowering therapy, but individuals who have more than one acute attack within 12 months and those with complications such as tophi or erosions should be offered it . Allopurinol is the drug of first choice. It inhibits xanthine oxidase, which reduces the conversion of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. The recommended staing dose is 100 mg daily, or 50 mg in older patients and in renal impairment. The dose of allopurinol should be increased by 100 mg every 4 weeks (50 mg in the elderly and those with renal impairment) until the target uric acid level is achieved, side-effects occur or the maximum recommended dose is reached (900 mg/day). Febuxostat also inhibits xanthine oxidase. It is typically used in patients with an inadequate response to allopurinol, and when allopurinol is contraindicated or causes adverse effects. Febuxostat undergoes hepatic metabolism and no dose adjustment is required for renal impairment. It is more effective than allopurinol but commonly provokes acute attacks when therapy is initiated. The usual staing dose is 80 mg daily, increasing to 120 mg daily in patients with an inadequate response. Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid, sulfinpyrazone and benzbromarone, lower urate levels but are seldom used in routine clinical practice. They are contraindicated in over-producers and those with renal impairment or urolithiasis and require patients to maintain a high fluid intake to avoid uric acid crystallisation in the renal tubules. Pegloticase is a biological treatment in which the enzyme uricase (oxidises uric acid to 5-hydroxyisourate, which is then conveed to allantoin) has been conjugated to monomethoxypolyethylene glycol. It is indicated for the treatment of tophaceous gout resistant to standard therapy and is administered as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for up to 6 months. It is highly effective at controlling hyperuricaemia and can cause regression of tophi. Lifestyle measures are equally impoant as drug therapy in the treatment of gout. Patients should be advised to lose weight where appropriate and to reduce excessive alcohol intake, especially beer. Ref - Davidsons 23e p1015-1016",C
Thiamine deficiency is seen in all except,Chronic diarrhoea,Chronic alcoholism,Homocystinemia,Food faddist,"Homocysteinemia Thiamine was the first vitamin to be identified and is therefore called as vitamin Bl. Thiamine deficiency or beriberi refers to the lack of thiamine pyrophosphate, the active form of the vitamin . Thiamine pyrophosphate acts as a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism through the decarboxylation of alphaketoacids and in the formation of glucose by acting as a coenzyme for the transketolase in the pentose monophosphate pathway Causes of Thiamine deficiency Persons may become deficient in thiamine either by not ingesting enough vitamin B-1 through the diet or by excess use, which may occur in hypehyroidism, pregnancy, lactation, or fever (sates of high energy consumption, such as hypehyroidism, pregnancy, or severe illness, require more thiamine and other nutrients.) Prolonged diarrhea may impair the body's ability to absorb vitamin B-1, and severe liver disease impairs its use. Decreased absorption is seen in - Diarrhea - Chronic intestinal disease - Alcoholism - Malnutrition - Gastric bypass surgery - Malabsorption syndrome - Celiac and tropical sprue - Hyperemesis gravidarum - Long term starvation - Fad diets( Fad diets often do not contain necessary amounts of thiamine) Increased depletion is seen in - Diuretic therapies - Peritoneal dialysis - Hemodialysis(Dialysis robs thiamine from the circulation) Alcohol is known to interfere directly with the absorption of thiamine and with the synthesis of thiamine pyrophosphate.( thiamine should always be replenished when refeeding a patient with alcoholism, as carbohydrate repletion without adequate thiamine can precipitate acute thiamine deficiency.) Beriberi has been repoed among refugees who are relying on emergency food aids. This is due to the lack of available micronutrition supplementation Food faddism and fad diet are terms which refer to the tendency for idiosyncratic diets and eating patterns. A fad diet is supposed and promoted to improve health but may do nothing at all, or even have the opposite results if it is nutritionally unbalanced and unconfirmed by scientific studies Developing countries are known to have more vitamin deficiency problems in general Pathophysiology (Beriberi) In healthy individuals who are deprived of thiamine, thiamine stores are depleted in approximately 1 month. However, within a week of no thiamine intake, healthy people develop a resting tachycardia, weakness, and decreased deep tendon reflexes and some people develop a peripheral neuropathy. Nervous system involvement is termed dry beriberi. Dry beriberi involves both the peripheral and the central nervous systems. - Peripheral nerve involvement is typically a symmetric motor and sensory neuropathy with pain , parasthesias, and loss of reflexes. The legs are affected more than the arms. - Central nervous system involvement results in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. - Wernicke's encephalopathy consists of nystagmus progressing to ophthalmoplegia, truncal ataxia, and confnsion. When there is additional loss of memory and a confabulatory psychosis, the syndrome is known as WernikeKorsakoff syndrome. Wet beriberi is the term used for the cardiovascular involvement of thiamine deficiency. Wet beriberi is characterized by marked peripheral vasodilation resulting in high-output hea .failure with dyspnea, tachycardia, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary and peripheral edema, with warm extremities mimicking cellulitis. Diagnosis In most instances, the clinical response to empiric thiamine therapy is used to suppo a diagnosis of thiamine deficiency. The most commonly used and widely available biochemical tests are measurement of erythrocyte transketolase activity and urinary thiamine excretion",C

The classic picture is high fever with no localising source of infection, a rash with thrombocytopenia and relative leukopenia- low paltelet and WBC count. Dengue infection can affect many organs and thus may present unusually as liver dysfunction, renal impairment, meningoencephalitis or gastroenteritis. Fever, headaches, eye pain, severe dizziness and loss of appetite. Hemorrhagic tendency (positive tourniquet test, spontaneous bruising, bleeding from mucosa, gingiva, injection sites, etc.; vomiting blood, or bloody diarrhoea) Thrombocytopenia (3or estimated as less than 3 platelets per high power field) Evidence of plasma leakage (Hematocrit more than 20% higher than expected, or drop in hematocrit of 20% or more from baseline following IV fluid, pleural effusion, ascites, hypoproteinemia) Encephalitic occurrences",C
Bleeding time is increased in all except:,Thrombocytopenia,Thrombasthenia,Renal failure,Acquired hemophilia,"aPTT is increased in acquired hemophilia Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia: AR, platelet lack receptor of Gp IIb/IIIa for fibrinogen, which form the bridges between platelets during aggregation. Glanzmann's thrombasthenia is a defect of platelet function(aggregation). It presents as superficial mucocutaneous bleeding with normal platelet count and single isolated platelets without clumping on peripheral smear. Platelet numbers and morphology are normal, but the bleeding time is markedly prolonged. Platelet dysfunction in renal failure is due retention of uremic toxins, anemia,and nitric oxide.",D

Antibody used in the treatment of Bronchial Asthma is:,Omalizumab,Rituximab,Daclizumab,Transtusuzumab,Answer is A (Omalizumab): Omalizumab is a recombinant IgE Antibody approved for use in treatment of moderate and severe persistent asthma Omalizumab is a recombinant IgE blocking antibody that neutralizes circulating IgE. It prevents circulating IgE from binding to receptors on the surface of Basophils and Mast cells and thus inhibits IgE mediated reactions. Omalizumab is indicated for treatment of 'moderate to severe' persistent asthma in patients who react to perennial allergens (Allergic Asthma). Treatment with Omalizumab has shown to reduce the number of exacerbations in patients with severe asthma and may improve asthma control. However this treatment is very expensive and is only suitable for highly selected patients who are not controlled on maximal doses of inhaler therapy and have a high circulating IgE (within a specified range).

Treatment of choice for severe alcoholic hepatitis patient with high discriminatory function test score is ?,Liver transplant,Colchicine,Steroid,Anti-TNF alfa agents,"Management Cessation of alcohol consumption is the single most impoant treatment and prognostic factor. Life-long abstinence is the best advice. General health and life expectancy are improved when this occurs, irrespective of the stage of liver disease. Abstinence is even effective at preventing progression, hepatic decompensation and death once cirrhosis is present. In the acute presentation of ALD it is impoant to identify and anticipate alcohol withdrawal and Wernicke's encephalopathy, which need treating in parallel with the liver disease and any complications of cirrhosis. Nutrition Good nutrition is very impoant, and enteral feeding a fine-bore nasogastric tube may be needed in severely ill patients. Drug therapy The optimum treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey's discriminative score >32) has been debated for some time. The STOPAH study was a large, multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial to evaluate the relative merits of glucocoicoids and/or a weak anti-TNF agent (pentoxifylline), alone or in combination. In a coho of 1103 patients, no significant benefit from pentoxifylline treatment was identified but treatment with prednisolone (40 mg daily for 28 days) led to a modest reduction in sho-term moality, from 17% in placebo-treated patients to 14% in the prednisolone group. These findings were consistent with earlier studies where an improvement in 28-day survival from 52% to 78% is seen when glucocoicoids are given to those with a Glasgow score of more than 9. Neither glucocoicoids nor pentoxifylline improved survival at 90 days or 1 year, however. Sepsis is the main side-effect of glucocoicoids, and existing sepsis and variceal haemorrhage are the main contraindications to their use. If the bilirubin has not fallen 7 days after staing glucocoicoids, the drugs are unlikely to reduce moality and should be stopped. Liver transplantation The role of liver transplantation in the management of ALD remains controversial. In many centres, ALD is a common indication for liver transplantation. The challenge is to identify patients with an unacceptable risk of returning to harmful alcohol consumption. Many programmes require a 6-month period of abstinence from alcohol before a patient is considered for transplantation. Although this relates poorly to the incidence of alcohol relapse after transplantation, liver function may improve to the extent that transplantation is no longer necessary. The outcome of transplantation for ALD is good and if the patient remains abstinent there is no risk of disease recurrence. Transplantation for alcoholic hepatitis has been thought to have a poorer outcome and is seldom performed due to concerns about recidivism; studies to quantify this are ongoing.

It is measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG). Normally, this begins at the atrioventricular node (AV node); from here the wave of depolarisation travels down to the apex of the hea. The hexaxial reference system can be used to visualise the directions in which the depolarisation wave may travel. When subjects were lying on the left side during sleep, due to the effect of gravity on hea, the position of hea changed, for example, turned and rotated, causing changes in the ECG of frontal plane and horizontal plane, which lead to a change in ECG.

It does not include developmental disorders of language or speech disorders that are limited to the motor apparatus of speech (dysarthria). Related disorders include alexia (disorder of reading), agraphia (disorder of writing), and apraxia (disorder of skilled movements).> Transcortical Motor Aphasia (TMA) results from an injury to the anterior superior frontal lobe. The injury is typically caused by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), commonly referred to as a stroke. The area of insult is sometimes referred to as a watershed region, a region surrounding Broca's area. The insult typically involves the left hemisphere as most people (regardless of handed-ness) are left hemisphere dominant for language (nearly 100% of right-handers, about 85% of left-handers).> Characteristics: TMA is a less common impairment than Broca's aphasia. People with TMA generally have good comprehension since Wernicke's area is usually not affected. People with TMA experience non-fluent (halting and effortful) speech due to frontal lobe damage and their utterances are typically only one or two words long. People with TMA retain the ability to repeat words, phrases or sentences.> Repetition is preserved since the arcuate fasciculus (the neural pathway that connects Wernicke's and Broca's areas via the parietal lobe) is intact. Preserved repetition is a defining quality of all transcortical aphasias. People who suffer from transcortical motor aphasia, however, may experience delays in initiation when they try to repeat words due to damage in the frontal lobe.",B

Brush burn is a type of?,Bruise,Contusion,Laceration,Abrasion,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Abrasion o Abrasion is a superficial injury involving superficial layer of epidermis and is caused by hard, blunt and rough object due to friction between skin and the object.

Injury is due to friction. The surface of injury show irregular parallel lines, i.e., furrows or grooves.# A violent lateral graze, due to rubbing of skin (as in dragging) is known as brush burn (Gravel rash).# Friction burn (Scuff or brush abrasion) occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface or when the skin is covered by clothing. It is an extensive superficial, reddened excoriated area without bleeding and with little or no linear mark.3) Pressure abrasions (crushing or friction abrasions) :# Though it is called friction abrasion, it results from pressure of the object on the body with no or little friction (it is a misnomer).# It is caused by crushing of superficial epidermis due to inward directed movement of object at around 90deg to skin.# Example are ligature marks in hanging/strangulation, teeth bites and nail marks.4) Impact abrasion (Imprint or contact abrasion):# It is caused by impact (but not pressure) with a rough object, when the force is applied at or near 90deg to skin surface.# It is depressed below surface unless associated with contusion (bruise).",D

The patient's increased frequency of anginal attacks is most likely because of",A sudden onset of vasospastic angina,Engaging in vigorous exercise,Cellular tolerance to organic nitrates,Induction of cytochrome P450 enzyme by nitroglycerin,"Tolerance to organic nitrates may develop in a few days or less, depending on the dose and frequency of administration. Continuous exposure to nitroglycerin through use of a transdermal skin patch has frequently caused nitrate tolerance. A daily 10-to-14-hour drug-free period will prevent nitrate tolerance. Nitrate tolerance is a cellular tolerance caused by depletion of sulfhydryl groups required for receptor signal transduction. The drug-free interval allows time for these groups to replenish before the next period of drug exposure. Nitrates are metabolized by hepatic nitroreductase, and there is neither evidence of cytochrome P 450 involvement nor of induction of this enzyme by drugs. Although the patient's symptoms could be caused by increased physical activity or onset of vasospasm, these are less likely causes in a patient with continuous nitroglycerin exposure.

The most likely diagnosis is-",Irritable bowel syndrome,Ulcerative colitis,Crohn's disease,Amebiasis,"Childhood Chronic ill health in childhood or adolescent IBD may result in growth failure, metabolic bone disease and delayed pubey. Loss of schooling and social contact, as well as frequent hospitalisation, can have impoant psychosocial consequences.Treatment is similar to that described for adults and may require glucocoicoids, immunosuppressive drugs, biological agents and surgery. Monitoring of height, weight and sexual development is crucial. Children with IBD should be managed by specialised paediatric gastroenterologists and transitioned to adult care in dedicated clinics . Pregnancy A women's ability to become pregnant is adversely affected by active IBD. Pre-conceptual counselling should focus on optimising disease control. During pregnancy, the rule of thirds applies: roughly one-third of women improve, one-third get worse and one-third remain stable with active disease. In the post-paum period, these changes sometimes reverse spontaneously. Drug therapy, including aminosalicylates, glucocoicoids Delayed growth and pubeal development: chronic active inflammation, malabsorption, malnutrition and long-term glucocoicoids contribute to sho stature and delayed development, with physical and psychological consequences. * Metabolic bone disease: more common with chronic disease beginning in childhood, resulting from chronic inflammation, dietary deficiency and malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D. * Drug side-effects and adherence issues: young people are more likely to require azathioprine or biological therapy than adults. Poor adherence to therapy is more common than with adults, as younger patients may feel well, lack self-motivation to adhere and believe that drugs are ineffective or cause side-effects. * Loss of time from education: physical illness, surgery, fatigue in chronic inflammatory bowel disease, privacy and dignity issues, and social isolation may all contribute. * Emotional difficulties: may result from challenges in coping with illness, problems with forming interpersonal relationships, and issues relating to body image or sexual function.

Homer's syndrome. All true except-,Miosis,Anhydrosis,Hyperchromatic iris,Apparent exophthalmos,"Horner's syndrome, also known as oculosympathetic paresis] is a combination of symptoms that arises when a group of nerves known as the sympathetic trunk is damaged. The signs and symptoms occur on the same side (ipsilateral) as it is a lesion of the sympathetic trunk. It is characterized by miosis (a constricted pupil), paial ptosis (a weak, droopy eyelid), apparent anhydrosis (decreased sweating), with apparent enophthalmos (inseed eyeballs) Signs that are found in people with Horner's syndrome on the affected side of the face include the following: ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) anhidrosis (decreased sweating) miosis (constriction of the pupil) sinking of the eyeball into the face inability to completely close or open the eyelid facial flushing headaches loss of ciliospinal reflex bloodshot conjunctiva, depending on the site of lesion. unilateral straight hair (in congenital Horner's syndrome); the hair on the affected side may be straight in some cases. heterochromia iridum (in congenital Horner's syndrome) Interruption of sympathetic pathways leads to several implications. It inactivates the dilator muscle and thereby produces miosis. It inactivates the superior tarsal muscle which produces ptosis. It reduces sweat secretion in the face. Patients may have apparent enophthalmos (affected eye looks to be slightly sunken in) but this is not the case. The ptosis from inactivation of the superior tarsal muscle causes the eye to appear sunken in, but when actually measured, enophthalmos is not present. The phenomenon of enophthalmos is seen in Horner's syndrome in cats, rats, and dogs. Sometimes there is flushing on the affected side of the face due to dilation of blood vessels under the skin. The pupil's light reflex is maintained as this is controlled the parasympathetic nervous system. In children, Horner's syndrome sometimes leads to heterochromia, a difference in eye color between the two eyes.This happens because a lack of sympathetic stimulation in childhood interferes with melanin pigmentation of the melanocytes in the superficial stroma of the iris. In veterinary medicine, signs can include paial closure of the third eyelid, or nictitating membrane. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2567",D

In hea failure total body sodium is increased, yet effective circulating volume is sensed as inadequate by baroceptors. Increased ADH and Aldosterone results which causes retention of water and sodium. Secondary water gain exceeds primary sodium gain resulting in hyponatremia. Elevated serum urea levels may be seen. Biochemical studies in hea failure may show renal insufficiency. Renal functions tests also determine whether cardiac failure is associated with prerenal azotemia. Right atrial mean pressure is increased congestive hea failure. In hea failure one or the other ventricle fails to discharge its contents or fails to fill normally. As a result the pressure in the atrium and venous system behind (upstream) the failing ventricle rise. - Harrison In patients will hea failure the levels of circulating norepinephrine may be markedly elevated reflecting the increased activity of the adrenergic nervous system. - Harrison",B
All are true about Glomus body tumor except -,Also k/a chemodectoma,Also k/a paraganglinoma,Common in older age,Brain Metastasis is common,"glomus tumor (also known as a 'solitary glomus tumor,' 'solid glomus tumor,') is a rare neoplasm arising from the glomus body and mainly found under the nail, on the fingeip or in the foot.:670 They account for less than 2% of all soft tissue tumors.The majority of glomus tumors are benign, but they can also show malignant features. Histologically, glomus tumors are made up of an afferent aeriole, anastomotic vessel, and collecting venule. Glomus tumors are modified smooth muscle cells that control the thermoregulatory function of dermal glomus bodies. As stated above, these lesions should not be confused with paragangliomas, which were formerly also called glomus tumors in now-antiquated clinical usage. Glomus tumors do not arise from glomus cells, but paragangliomas do. Malignant glomus tumors, or glomangiosarcomas, are extremely rare and usually represent a locally infiltrative malignancy. However, metastases do occur and are usually fatal. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 556",D

The drugs not used for treatment of osteoporosis are-,Biphosphonates,Steroids,Denosumab,Calciam,", Ans. is 'b' i.e., Steroids Management of osteoporosisNon trharmacolosical therapyo Calcium and vitamin D supplementationo Important additional lifestyle measures includeExerciseSmoking cessationAvoidance o f heavy alcoholCounselling on fall preventionPharmacologic therapyEstrogenso A large body of clinical trial data indicates that various types of estrogens (conjugated equine estrogens, estradiol, estrone, esterified estrogens, eihinylestradiol and mestranol) reduce bone turnover, prevent bone loss and induce small increase in bone mass of spine, hip and total body.o The effect of estrogen are seen in women with natural or surgical menopause and in late menopausal women.Biphosphonate (Alendronate, risedronate, ibandronaie, Zoledronic acid)o First line therapy1 because of their efficacy, favourable cost and availability of the long term data.o Atendronate or risedronate are preferred.Denosumabo An alternative for patient who cannot tolerate biphosphonate or who have difficulty with dosing requirements and have impaired renal function.o Denosumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against RANKL that reduces osteoclastogenesis.o RANKL is a member of TNF superfamily of ligands and receptors and is essential for the function of bone resorbing osteoclasts.o RANKL accelarates osteoclastogenesis when it binds to its receptor RANK.o Denosumab improve bone mineral density and reduce the incidence of new verierbral hip and non vertebral fractures by acting against RANKL.Raloxifeno Raloxifen is given for patients who cannot tolerate or are not candidates for any biphosphonates.o Raloxifen and tamoxifen are tissue selective estrogen receptor modulator.o Their characteristic feature is that they do not have pure agonist or antagonistic action on estrogen receptors.o SERMS are 'selective' that means SERM blocks estrogen in some tissues and activates estrogen action in others.o Raloxifen increases bone mineral density and reduces the risk of vertebral fractures.o Raloxifen also appears to lower the risk of breast cancer and itdoes not stimulate endometrial hyperplasia or vaginal bleeding.o Tamoxifen is another SERM used primarily for the prevention and management of breast cancer. It is not typically used for osteoporosis but postmenopausal women who are receiving treatment with tamoxifen for breast cancer are probably receiving bone protection.o Raloxifen is considered the first line drug for t/t of osteoprosis. However, it is somewhat less effective than estrogen and biphosphonates.Parathyroid hormone therapyo PTH therapy is suggested for patients with severe ostoporosis who are unable to tolerate any of the available biphosphonates or to those who continue to have fractures even after one year of biphosphonate therapy.o Parathyroid hormone seems an unlikely candidate for the treatment of osteoporosis because of its well described deleterious effect on bone. However, intermittent administration of recombinant human PTH stimulates bone formation more than resorption and is effective for fracture reduction.Exogenous vitamin Ko Exogenous vitamin K is required for the carboxylation of osteocalcin which in turn allows osteocalcin to bind to hydroxyapatite mineral.o A vitamine K2 preparation (menatetrone) is widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis in Japan.Strontium renelateo Strontium ranelate increases bone mass throughout the skeleton. It appears to be moderately antiresorptive while at the same time not causing much decrease in hone formation.o Pharmacological agents used to manage osteoporosis either act by : -Decreasing the rate of bone resorption fantiresorptive therapy)Promoting bone formation (anabolic therapy)o Since bone remodelling is a coupled process antiresorptive drugs ultimately decrease the rate of bone formation and therefore do not promote substantial gains in BMD.o Thus strontium renelate is unique because it decreases osteoclastosis as well as promote bone formation.o Strontium ranelate has a novel mechanism of action for an osteoporotic drug as it acts on bone resorption to reduce the rate of bone decay but also acts on bone formation preventing the growth of new bone.",B

The causes of systemic secondary insult to injured brain include all of the following except -,Hypercapnia,Hypoxemia,Hypotension,Hypothermia,"Patients with primary brain injury whether due to any trauma or stroke are at significant risk for some secondary ischemic brain injury?

Causes of secondary brain injury are - Hypotension

Hypotension should be strictly avoided as significant hypotensive events as short as 10 minutes in duration have been shown to adversely influence the outcome after traumatic brain injury.
Even in patients with stroke or head trauma, who do not require I.C.P. monitoring, close attention to adequate cerebral perfusion is required.

Hypoxia

Hypoxia (percutaneous oxygen saturation < 90%) alone, or in combination with hypotension, also leads to secondary brain injury.

Fever

Fever can adversely affect the outcome of the patient.
So aggressive control of fever with a goal of normothermia is warranted and can usually be achieved with antipyretic medication and cooling blankets.

Hyperglycemia

This is also associated with worsened clinical outcome after stroke and trauma.
Intravenous insulin is encouraged for control of hyperglycemia as this allows better regulation of serum glucose level than subcutaneous insulin.
A reasonable goal is to maintain serum glucose level at < 160 mg/dl.

Also know,

Effect of hypothermia on secondary brain injury.

The drop in temperature inhibits the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and attenuates the release of dopamine, in brain ischemia animal models, suggesting a protective effect of hypothermia in brain injury.

Secondary brain injury can be a major determinant in the outcome of the patient so strategies for minimizing secondary brain insults are an integral part of critical care of all patients.
Episodes of secondary brain insults are usually not associated with apparent neurological worsening, rather they lead to cumulative injury, which manifest as higher mortality or worsened long term functional outcome.
Thus clinical strategies to prevent secondary brain insults involve close monitoring of vital signs and risk factors to prevent secondary ischemia.",D

which one of the following is not the appropriate treatment of hypehyroidism due to subacute thyroiditis?,Propylthiouracil,Suppoive treatment,Subtotal thyroidectomy,beta blockers,"Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited thyroid condition associated with a triphasic clinical course of hypehyroidism, hypothyroidism, and return to normal thyroid function. Subacute thyroiditis may be responsible for 15-20% of patients presenting with thyrotoxicosis and 10% of patients presenting with hypothyroidism . Recognizing this condition is impoant; because it is self-limiting, no specific treatment, such as antithyroid or thyroid hormone replacement therapy, is necessary in most patients. In some cases antithyroids are used to allete the symptoms . In general, the following three forms of subacute thyroiditis are recognized: Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis - Also known as subacute painful or de Quervain thyroiditis Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis - Also known as subacute painless thyroiditis Subacute postpaum thyroiditis Treatment The treatment of subacute thyroiditis is generally suppoive to reduce the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and to control neck pain in the setting of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. Because no new hormone is being made, antithyroid medications are not effective in these conditions. Although the abnormal thyroid levels are temporary, emotional suppo is often necessary. Patients are often dehydrated from thyrotoxicosis; encourage all patients to drink 6-8 cups per day of noncaffeinated fluids. Surgical care is almost never recommended for subacute thyroiditis. In rare cases, surgery is recommended for patients who have frequent recurrences of thyrotoxicosis from subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis or recurrent pain from subacute granulomatous thyroiditis Ref - harrison internal medicine 20e p2708-2709",D
True about rickets -,Decreased alkaline phosphatase,Hyperphosphatemia,Hypophosphatemia,Hypophosphaturia,"In children, before epiphyseal fusion, vita- min D deficiency results in growth retardation associated with an expansion of the growth plate known as rickets. Vitamin D deficiency leads to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in decreased serum total and ionized calcium values. This hypocalcemia results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, a homeostatic response that initially maintains serum calcium levels at the expense of the skeleton. Due to the PTH-induced increase in bone turnover, alkaline phosphatase levels are often increased. In addition to increasing bone resorption, PTH decreases urinary calcium excretion while promoting phosphaturia. This results in hypophosphatemia, which exacerbates the mineralization defect in the skeleton. Reference : page 2465-66 Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 19th edition",C

Gradient in pulmonary aery wedge pressure and left ventricular end diastolic pressure is seen in,Aoic regurgitation,Constrictive pericarditis,Left atrial myxoma,Pulmonary thromboembolism,Answer is C (Left atrial myxoma) An increased gradient during diastole is suggestive of an obstructive lesion between Left atrium and Left ventricle that is not allowing pressures to normalize between the atria and ventricle such as atrial myxoma. Pulmonary aery wedge pressure represents Left atrial pressure. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure represents Left ventricular pressure. Gradient between Left atrial pressure (PCWP) and Left ventricular pressure during diastole: Normally there is no gradient during diastole as both pressures are equal. An increased gradient during diastole is suggestive of an obstructive lesion between Left atrium and Left ventricle that is not allowing pressures to normalize between the atria and ventricle.

Customarily, the panelists are experts in the area to be investigated.",The first round in the Delphi method involves development of a questionnaire,All are true,"Delphi method 

Delphi method is a systemic, interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of independent experts.
The first round of the delphi method essentially involves development of a questionnaire that are posted to members of the team experts.
The carefully selected experts answer questionnaires in two or more rounds.
After each round, a facilitator provides an anonymous summary of the experts forecasts from the previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgment.
Thus, experts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other members of the panel.
It is believed that during this process the range of the answers will decrease and the group will converge towards the 'correct' answer.
Finally, the process is stopped after a pre-defined stop criterion (e.g. number of rounds, stability of results) and the mean and median scores of the final rounds determine the results.

Principal of Delphi 

Delphi is based on the principal that forecast from a structured group of experts are more accurate than those from unstructured groups or individuals.
The technique can be adapted for use in face-to-face meetings, and is then called mini-Delphi or Estimale - Talk - Estimate (ECE).
Delphi has been widely used for business forecasting and has certain advantages over another structured forecasting approach called, prediction markets.

Key characteristics of Delphi method 

The following key characteristics of the Delphi method help the participant to focus on the issues at hand and separate Delphi from other methodology -

1. Structuring of information flow

The initial contributions from the experts are collected in the form of answer of questionnaires and their comments to these answers.
The panel director controls the interactions among the participants by processing the information and filtering out irrelevant content.
This avoids the negative effects of face-to-face panel discussion and solves the usual problems of group dynamics.

2. Regular feedback

Participants comment on their own forecasts, the responses of others and on the progress of the panel as a whole.
At any moment they can revise their earlier statements.
While in regular group meetings participants tend to stick to previously stated opinions and often conform too much to group leader, the Delphi methods prevents it.

3. Anonymity of the participants

Usually all participants maintain anonymity.
Their identity is not revealed even after the completion of the final report.

This stops them from dominating others in the process using their authority or personality, frees them to some extent from their personal biases, minimizes the 'bandwagan effect' or 'halo effect', allows them to freely express their opinions, encourages open critique and admitting errors by revision earlier judgments.",D

"For screening of hepatitis-B, most commonly used test is -",Microtitre assay,RIA,Double diffusion,PCR,"(PCR) (948 - 52 Davidson 21st) (2540-50-H1 8th)Tests used for screaming hepatitis B are estimation of surface antigen (HBSAg) anti HBc and anti HBS antibodies.Which people should be screened for hepatitis B.* Hemodialysis patients* Pregnant women* Infants bom mother who are HBSAg positive* Person known or suspected of having bean exposed to HBV - donors of blood, organ and tissue.* People bom in areas where HBSAg prevalence in found to be equal to or more than 2%.* Men who have had sex with man* Drug addicts using injectable drugs HIV positive individuals.* Patients likely to take immunosuppressive treatment or cancer chemotherapy.* Patients with increase liver enzyme of undetermined cause.The tests, called assays, for detection of hepatitis B virus infection involve serum or blood tests that detect either viral antigens (proteins produced by the virus) or antibodies produced by the host. Interpretation of these assays is complex.The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection.PCR tests have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens. These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment. Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.For infections caused by agents such as Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other agents both viral or bacterial origin, commonly used tests determine the presence of specific antibodies produced by the patient's immune system in response to infectious agent.New generation of tests has been developed, which are based on measuring the presence of the infectious agent within the patient sample directly. These tests detect the presence of nucleic acids (the genetic material) of the infections agents in the blood or other samples from the patient. The most common is the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) which can detect 100 copies or more of an infectious agent in a single sample. PCR uses an enzymatic reaction to amplify specific nucleic acid sequences from the infectious agent if they are present in the sample. There are several problems with this method. PCR uses specific nucleic acid sequences (Primers) from an already known sequence of the infectious agent. Therefore, if the infectious agent has not been sequenced, PCR can not be used. Similarly, if the infectious agent mutates very rapidly, the Primers may not recognize the infectious agent and a false negative test will result... Another is a hybridization method where the amplified product is detected by hybridization to an infectious agent specific probe.The second method is based on direct hybridization of the infectious agent's nucleic acid to a synthetic nucleic acid probe. The hybridized infectious agent is then detected by amplifications using non-enzymatic methods.The major drawback of this method is that it is less sensitive (minimum 1,000 copies must be present in a sample) and requires a larger amount of the patient's sample (minimum 1 ml blood compared with 0.1 ml for PCR).Microchip assayThere is a need for a sensitive and rapid assay, which is easy to perform, can be used in laboratories with very little experience or no experience in molecular biological methods. The 'first generation' diagnostic microarray developed can detect thirteen infectious agents simultaneously, and can be expanded do detect several hundreds, and reduces the detection time to less than 30 minutes. Because it is based on a rapid hybridization and no enzymatic amplification is used, it is not affected by impurities in the sample. It can be adapted to any type of sample such as blood, stool or tissues. The size of the chip is less than one cm2and the active site is less than 1 mm2.",D
Munchaussen syndrome is a,Factitious disorder,Conversion disorder,Malingering,Dissassociation disorder,"(A) Factitious disorder # FACTITIOUS DISORDERS are conditions in which a person acts as if he or she has an illness by deliberately producing, feigning, or exaggerating symptoms. Factitious disorder by proxy is a condition in which a person deliberately produces, feigns, or exaggerates symptoms in a person who is in their care. Munchausen syndrome is an older term for Factitious disorder. People with this condition may produce symptoms by contaminating urine samples, taking hallucinogens, injecting themselves with bacteria to produce infections, and other such similar behaviour. They might be motivated to perpetrate factitious disorders either as a patient or by proxy as a caregiver to gain any variety of benefits including attention, nurturance, sympathy, and leniency that are unobtainable any other way. Somatoform disorders are characterised by multiple somatic complaints. Conversion disorder is a condition in which you show psychological stress in physical ways. The condition was so named to describe a health problem that starts as a mental or emotional crisis -- a scary or stressful incident of some kind -- and converts to a physical problem. Malingering is a medical term that refers to fabricating or exaggerating the symptoms of mental or physical disorders for a variety of 'secondary gain' motives, which may include financial compensation (often tied to fraud); avoiding school, work or military service; obtaining drugs; getting lighter criminal sentences; or simply to attract attention or sympathy. Dissociation is an altered state of consciousness characterized by partial or complete disruption of the normal integration of a person's normal conscious or psychological functioning. Dissociation is most commonly experienced as a subjective perception of one's consciousness being detached from one's emotions, body and/or immediate surroundings.",A

These are retrospective studies. Case control studies sta with outcomes or dependant variables. They then look back into past for possible independent variable (that may have caused the disease) to see if a possible risk factor was present more frequently in cases thean controls.Coho Studies: This focusses on factors related to development of a disease. A coho (group of people with common characteristics) that does not have the disease of interest is selected & then observed for an extended period. Some of the members will already have been exposed to a suspected risk factor for the disease & others will eventually become exposed. Incidence of disease can be studied. It is also known as followup, or longitudinal incidence or prospective study.Clinical trial: It is an experiemtnal method of epidemiological study. Clinical trials aim to isolate one factor (such as use of a drug) & examine its contributions to patients health by holding all other factors as constant as possible. They also utilise control groups & involve randomisation so also known as randomised controlled clinical trials.",A

Fluid containing which of the following substance is used in peritoneal dialysis,NaCl,Urea,Heparin,Dextrose,"In peritoneal dialysis, 1.5-3 L of a dextrose-containing solution is infused into the peritoneal cavity and allowed to dwell for a set period of time, usually 2-4 h. Peritoneal dialysis solutions are available in volumes typically ranging from 1.5 to 3 L. The major difference between the dialysate used for peritoneal rather than hemodialysis is that the hypeonicity of peritoneal dialysis solutions drives solute and fluid removal, whereas solute removal in hemodialysis depends on concentration gradients, and fluid removal requires transmembrane pressure. Typically, dextrose at varying concentrations contributes to the hypeonicity of peritoneal dialysate. Icodextrin is a nonabsorbable carbohydrate that can be used in place of dextrose. Studies have demonstrated more efficient ultrafiltration with icodextrin than with dextrose-containing solutions. Icodextrin is typically used as the 'last fill' for patients on CCPD or for the longest dwell in patients on CAPD. The most common additives to peritoneal dialysis solutions are heparin to prevent obstruction of the dialysis catheter lumen with fibrin and antibiotics during an episode of acute peritonitis. Insulin may also be added in patients with diabetes mellitus ref - harrisons internal medicine 20e pg2124",D

If the mass is greater than 1 cm, the first step is to determine whether it is a functioning or nonfunctioning tumor via measurement of serum metanephrines (pheochromocytoma) and dexamethasone-suppressed cortisol (Cushing syndrome) levels. As the patient has no history of malignancy, a CT-guided fine-needle aspiration is not required. The patient has normal BP and potassium; therefore, plasma aldosterone/plasma renin ratio to evaluate primary hyperaldosteronism is not required. There are no signs of feminization or erectile dysfunction, so sex-steroid measurement is not indicated. Contrast-enhanced CT after appropriate serum work-up determines true size and characteristics (Hounsfield units ). Malignant indicators include large-size (>4-6cm), irregular margins, soft tissue calcifications, tumor inhomogeneity, high CT attenuation (values greater than 10 HU), or delayed washout of contrast. CT scan should be repeated in 6 months and again in 1 year to ensure stability of the adrenal mass, but only after a functioning tumor has been excluded.",C

Paradoxical splitting of second hea sound is seen in-,RBBB,ASD,LBBB,VSD,"A split S2 is a finding upon auscultation of the S2 hea sound. It is caused when the closure of the aoic valve (A2) and the closure of the pulmonary valve (P2) are not synchronized during inspiration. The second hea sound (S2) is caused by the closure of the aoic and pulmonic valves, which causes vibration of the valve leaflets and the adjacent structures. The aoic valve closes slightly before the pulmonic, and this difference is accentuated during inspiration when S2 splits into two distinct components (physiological splitting). During expiration, the pulmonic valve closes at nearly the same time as the aoic, and splitting of S2 cannot be heard Exercise increases the intensity of both the aoic and pulmonic components of S2, whereas deep inspiration increases the intensity of the pulmonic component only.

A 14 yrs old girl on exposure to cold has pallor of extremities followed by pain and cyanosis.

A Female patient with Raynaud9s phenomenon should be evaluated for possibility of scleroderma or any other connective tissue disease.Raynaud's phenomenon is the first manifestation of scleroderma in almost every patient with the disease and it precedes other symptoms in 70% of cases Q.The interval between Raynaud's phenomenon and appearance of other manifestations is generally brief (weeks to months) in diffuse scleroderma, while in limited scleroderma the period of onset between Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic manifestations is commonly several years.Scleroderma is a rare disorder but it initially presents with Raynaud's phenomenon which is quite frequent in the general population. Therefore it is important to keep scleroderma in mind while dealing with Raynaud's phenomenon.More on Scleroderma : - Scleroderma is primarily a disease of the female Q (female to male ratio of 3:1) with a peak incidence in the 50 - 60 year age group.Raynaud's phenomenon occurs due to microvascular involvement Q.Microvascular disease is consistently present early in the course of systemic sclerosis. Intimal proliferation is evident in 100% of digital arteries of patients with systemic sclerosis. Capillary dilatation with leaking as well as destruction is also common.Stress and cold temperature induce an exaggerated vasoconstriction of the small arteries, arterioles and arteriovenous shunts of the skin of the digits. This is manifested clinically as pallor and cyanosis of the digits followed by reactive hyperemia after rewarming. Unlike episodes of uncomplicated primary Raynaud's phenomenon, attacks of Raynaud phenomenon in patient with scleroderma are often painful and frequently lead to digital ulcerations, gangrenes or amputation.Also knowDiseases associated with Raynaud's phenomenon :Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with several connective tissue disease.Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)Systemic lupus erythematosusRheumatoid arthritisSjogren syndromeDermatomyositisPolymyositisVasculitisAll patients with history of Raynaud's phenomenon should be asked about symptoms suggestive of autoimmune disease such as arthritis, dry eyes or dry mouth, myalgias, fever, skin rash or cardiomyopathy abnormalities.If underlying autoimmune disease is suspected, the patient should be evaluated for presence of specific autoantibodies.Antinuclear antibody (ANA) assays are highly sensitive for the type of connective tissue disorders that are often associated with Raynaud's phenomenon. However, positive ANA, are quite nonspecific and therefore should be followed by testing for autoantibodies with higher positive predictive values for such conditions.",B

Manifestations of aoic dissection are -,Pericardial effusion,AR,MR,AMI,"The peak incidence of aoic dissection is in the sixth and seventh decades. Men are more affected than women by a ratio of 2:1. The presentations of aoic dissection and its variants are the consequences of intimal tear, dissecting hematoma, occlusion of involved aeries, and compression of adjacent tissues.Acute aoic dissection presents with the sudden onset of pain , which often is described as very severe and tearing and is associated with diaphoresis. The pain may be localized to the front or back of the chest, often the interscapular region, and typically migrates with propagation of the dissection. Other symptoms include syncope, dyspnea, and weakness. Physical findings may include hypeension or hypotension, loss of pulses, aoic regurgitation, pulmonary edema, and neurologic findings due to carotid aery obstruction (hemiplegia, hemianesthesia) or spinal cord ischemia (paraplegia). Bowel ischemia, hematuria, and myocardial ischemia have all been observed. These clinical manifestations reflect complications resulting from the dissection occluding the major aeries. Fuhermore, clinical manifestations may result from the compression of adjacent structures (e.g., superior cervical ganglia, superior vena cava, bronchus, esophagus) by the expanding dissection, causing aneurysmal dilation, and include Horner's syndrome, superior vena cava syndrome, hoarseness, dysphagia, and airway compromise. Hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade may complicate a type A lesion with retrograde dissection. Acute aoic regurgitation is an impoant and common (>50%) complication of proximal dissection. It is the outcome of either a circumferential tear that widens the aoic root or a disruption of the annulus by a dissecting hematoma that tears a leaflet(s) or displaces it, inferior to the line of closure. Signs of aoic regurgitation include bounding pulses, a wide pulse pressure, a diastolic murmur often radiating along the right sternal border, and evidence of congestive hea failure.

Diabetes control is best monitored by -,Serum glucose,Post prandial blood glucose,HbA1c,HbA2c,"Measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is the standard method for assessing long-term glycemic control. When plasma glucose is consistently elevated, there is an increase in nonenzymatic glycation of hemoglobin. This alteration reflects the glycemic history over the previous 2-3 months, because erythrocytes have an average life span of 120 days (glycemic level in the preceding month contributes about 50% to the HbA1c value). Measurement of HbA1c at the 'point of care' allows for more rapid feedback and may therefore assist in adjustment of therapy. A rise of 1% in HbA1c corresponds to an approx average increase of 2 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) in blood glucose. Reference : page 2410 Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 19th edition",C

Most common source of infection for whooping cough -,Chronic carrier,Acute carrier,Case,Convelescent carrier,"<p> Peussis/Whooping cough:- An acute infectious disease ,usually of young children, caused by B.peussis. Clinically characterised by insidious onset with mild fever and an irritating cough, gradually becoming paroxysmal with the characteristic whoop often with cyanosis and vomiting. Also known as 'Hundred day cough'. AGENT FACTORS:- 1. Agent-B.peussis. Small percentage of case are caused by B.parapeussis, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus. 2. Source of infection- B.peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&;t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&;t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B.parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs,sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air. The role of fomites in the spread of disease appears to be very small , unless they are freshly contaminated. Incubation period-7-14 days , but not more than 3 weeks. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.167}</p>",C

Which of the following types of bias can be reduced by allowing equal interview time -,Berkesonian bias,Recall bias,Selection bias,Interviewer bias,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Interviewer bias Interviewer's bias o This type of bias may occurs when the interviewer knows the hypothesis and also knows who the cases are. o This prior information may lead him to question the cases more throughly than the controls regarding a postive history of the suspected causal factor. o This bias can therefore be reduced by allowing equal time to interview both cases and controls. o This bias can be eleminated by double blinding. Slection bias o This type of bias may occur when the cases and controls selected for the study group are not representative of the cases and controls in the general population. o This type of bias can be best controlled by its prevention i.e., by proper selection of a representative study group. Recall bias (Memory bias) : o This type of bias may occur when cases and controls are asked to recall ceain events, and subjects in one group are more likely to remember the event than those in the other group. o For example people take aspirin commonly and for many reasons, but patients diagnosed as having peptic ulcer disease may recall the ingestion of aspirin in greater accuracy than those without G I problems.

Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) are seen in,Pteryglum,Hematochromatosis,Wilson's disease,Menke's kinked hair syndrome,"Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is a rare but impoant autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by a variety of mutations in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13. Total body copper is increased, with excess copper deposited in, and causing damage to, several organs. Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings are a common ophthalmologic finding in patients with Wilson disease. Initially thought to be due to the accumulation of silver, they were first demonstrated to contain copper in 1934. KF rings are seen in most of the patients with neurologic involvement from Wilson disease. These rings are caused by deposition of excess copper on the inner surface of the cornea in the Descemet membrane. A slit lamp examination is mandatory to make a diagnosis of KF rings paicularly in the early stages unless the rings are visible to the naked eye in conditions of severe copper overload. Kayser-Fleischer rings do not cause any impairment of vision but disappear with treatment and reappear with disease progression. KF rings not specific to Wilson disease alone, they are also seen in other chronic cholestatic disorders such as primary biliary cholangitis and children with neonatal cholestasis.

Dumping syndrome is due to:,Diarrhoea,Presence of hypeonic content in small intestine,Vagotomy,Reduced gastric capacity,"Answer is B (Presence of Hypeonic Contents in small intestine) DUMPING SYNDROME refers to a syndrome of abdominal and vasomator symptoms which results from dumping of food stuffs with a high osmotic load, front the stomach, into the small bowel. Loss of storage capacity of stomach and ablation, by pass or destruction of pylorus, results in rapid emptying of hyperostnolar chyme into duodenummm and small intestine. Extracellular fluid then shifts into the intestinal lumen to restore isotonicity resulting in decreased intravascular volume, which gives rise to the vasomotor symptoms. Note that while reduced gastric capacity contributes, option (b) is a more accurate answer. Dumping Syndrome is actually of two types: Early dumping syndrome (as described above) Late dumping syndrome: This is Reactive hypoglvcemiae. The carbohydrate load in thesmall intestine later causes a rise in plasma glucose, which in turn causes insulin levels to rise causing a secondary hypoglycemia.",B

He is having truncal obesity with sub-capsular bilateral cataracts.Which is the best drug for this patient?,Mycophenolate,Levamisole,Cyclophosphamide,Azathioprine,"Steroid-dependent patients, frequent relapses, and steroid-resistant patients may be candidates for alternative agents, paicularly if the child suffers severe coicosteroid toxicity (cushingoid appearance, hypeension, cataracts, and/or growth failure). Cyclophosphamide prolongs the duration of remission and reduces the number of relapses in children with frequently relapsing and steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. The potential side effects of the drug (neutropenia, disseminated varicella, hemorrhagic cystitis, alopecia, sterility, increased risk of future malignancy) should be carefully reviewed with the family before initiating treatment. The dose of cyclophosphamide is 2-3 mg/kg/24 hr given as a single oral dose, for a total duration of 8-12 wk. Alternate-day prednisone therapy is often continued during the course of cyclophosphamide administration. During cyclophosphamide therapy, the white blood cell count must be monitored weekly and the drug should be withheld if the count falls below 5,000/mm3",C

Major risk factor for development of lung abscess is:,Pneumonia,Aspiration,Lung cancer,Tuberculosis,"The major risk factor for primary lung abscesses is aspiration. Patients at particular risk for aspirationsuch as those with altered mental status, alcoholism, drug overdose, seizures, bulbar dysfunction, prior cerebrovascular or cardiovascular events, or neuromuscular disease, are most commonly affected. 

Lung abscesses are usually characterized as either primary (~80% of cases) or secondary. 
Primary lung abscesses usually arise from aspiration, are often caused principally by anaerobic bacteria, and occur in the absence of an underlying pulmonary or systemic condition. 
Secondary lung abscesses arise in the setting of an underlying condition, such as a post obstructive process  (e.g., a bronchial foreign body or tumour) or a systemic process (e.g., HIV infection or another immunocompromising condition). 
Lung abscesses can also be characterized as acute (<4–6 weeks in duration) or chronic (~40% of cases).

In the early stages, patients can be asymptomatic with fluctuating abnormal LFTs. With more severe liver damage, however, the presentation can be with jaundice, poal hypeension or other signs of cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation . Patients with clinically silent chronic liver disease frequently present when abnormalities in liver function are observed on routine blood testing, or when clinical events, such as an intercurrent infection or surgical intervention, cause the liver to decompensate. Patients with compensated cirrhosis can undergo most forms of surgery without significantly increased risk, whereas decompensation can be a complication in all cases and the presence of poal hypeension with intra-abdominal varices can make abdominal surgery more hazardous. The possibility of undiagnosed liver disease should be borne in mind in all patients in at-risk groups undergoing significant surgery. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg856",B

Mutation of which of the following gene is most impoant in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria?,Decay accelerating factor (DAF),Membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL),Glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI),CD8 binding protein,"Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH): PNH is an acquired chronic Hemolytic Anemia characterized by persistent intravascular hemolysis subject to recurrent exacerbations. In addition to hemolysis, there is often pancytopenia and a distinct tendency to venous thrombosis. This triad makes PNH a truly unique clinical condition.Hemolysis in PNH is mainly intravascular and is due to an intrinsic abnormality of the red cell, which makes it exquisitely sensitive to activated C, whether it is activated through the alternative pathway or through an antigen-antibody reaction. The former mechanism is mainly responsible for chronic hemolysis in PNH; the latter explains why the hemolysis can be dramatically exacerbated in the course of a viral or bacterial infection. Hypersusceptibility to C is due to deficiency of several protective membrane proteins, of which CD59 is the most impoant because it hinders the inseion into the membrane of C9 polymers. The molecular basis for the deficiency of these proteins has been pinpointed not to a defect in any of the respective genes, but rather to the shoage of a unique glycolipid molecule, GPI, which, through a peptide bond, anchors these proteins to the surface membrane of cells. The shoage of GPI is due in turn to a mutation in an X-linked gene, called PIG-A, required for an early step in GPI biosynthesis.Ref: Harrison&;s Principles of Internal Medicine; 19th edition; Chapter 129 Hemolytic Anemias and Anemia Due to Acute Blood Loss Page no: 660",C

"A 26 year old man complains ofabdominal distension, swelling of the legs and easy fatigability.

He has pedal edema, ascites and tender hepatomegaly. Precordium is quiter with loud and some what early apical third hea sound. The probable diagnosis is -",Cor Pulmonale,Tricuspid stenosis,Constrictive pericarditis,Pulmonary stenosis,"Constrictive pericarditis is a medical condition characterized by a thickened, fibrotic pericardium, limiting the hea&;s ability to function normally.In many cases, the condition continues to be difficult to diagnose and therefore benefits from a good understanding of the underlying cause The pathophysiological characteristics of constrictive pericarditis are due to a thickened, fibrotic pericardium that forms a non-compliant shell around the hea. This shell prevents the hea from expanding when blood enters it. This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the hea. During inspiration, pressure in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the left atrium, subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs. During expiration, the amount of blood entering the right ventricle will decrease, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, and increased filling of the left ventricle and subsequent increased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole.This is known as ventricular interdependence, since the amount of blood flow into one ventricle is dependent on the amount of blood flow into the other ventricle. Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: fatigue, swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a hea attack Diagnosis: The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is often difficult to make. In paicular, restrictive cardiomyopathy has many similar clinical features to constrictive pericarditis, and differentiating them in a paicular individual is often a diagnostic dilemma. Chest X-Ray - pericardial calcification (common but not specific), pleural effusions are common findings. Echocardiography - the principal echographic finding is changes in cardiac chamber volume. CT and MRI - useful in select cases. BNP blood test - tests for the existence of the cardiac hormone brain natriuretic peptide, which is only present in RCMP but not in CP Conventional cardiac catheterization Physical examination - can reveal clinical features including Kussmaul&;s sign and a pericardial knock Treatment: The definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis is pericardial stripping, which is a surgical procedure where the entire pericardium is peeled away from the hea. This procedure has significant risk involved,with moality rates of 6% or higher in major referral centers. A poor outcome is almost always the result after a pericardiectomy is performed for constrictive pericarditis whose origin was radiation-induced, fuher some patients may develop hea failure post-operatively.

No. 94.In patients with salicylate poisoning, initially the acidic metabolites of salicylic acid accumulate and cause metabolic acidosis.This causes the following acid base reaction to shift to left (because of addition of H) CO2 + H20 = H2CO3 = H+ + HCO3-This causes decrease in extracellular HCO3* This in turn stimulates the medullary chemoreceptors to increase ventilation and return the ratio of / PaCO2 and thus pH towards normal* The formula given to predict the degree of compensation required for simple form of metabolic acidosis is PaCO2 = 1.5 x + 8 or you can say that the PaCO2 is expected to decrease 1.25 mm of Hg for each mmol/L decrease in The normal values of PCO2 and HCO3-Arterial PC02 - 40 +- 2 mm HgArterial - 24 +- mm HgThus a patient with metabolic acidosis and of 12 mmol/L would be expected to have a PaCO2 between 24 and 28 mm Hg. (to compensate for the acidosis)Values of PaCO2 below 24 or greater than 28 mm Hg will mean mixed disturbance.If PaCO2 is < 24 it means metabolic acidosis + respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation has led to excess CO2 washout causing respiratory alkalosis)If PaCO2 > 28 it means - metabolic acidosis respiratory acidosisHere is a table giving predictions of compensatory response on simple acid base disturbance.

In which of the following conditions would the patient most likely be normotensive?,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Hypothyroidism,Cushing syndrome,Baer syndrome,"Bater syndrome is a mineralocoicoid excess state caused by a defect in chloride reabsorption in the kidneys. The defect in chloride reabsorption in the ascending tubule also affects the reabsorption of sodium; therefore, there is an augmented distal delivery of sodium with increased exchange of sodium for potassium and hydrogen ions in the distal tubule, producing a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Hypokalemia is a stimulus of renin release from the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, which results in JG apparatus hyperplasia. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system increases the production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Hypokalemia also increases the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and 12 in the kidneys. Both of these chemical mediators are potent vasodilators. Angiotensin II and aldosterone stimulate the synthesis of renal kallikrein, which is then conveed into bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Because of this sequence of events, patients with Bater syndrome do not develop hypeension, even in the presence of the excess aldosterone and angiotensin II, because their hypeensive effects are offset by the vasodilatation induced by the prostaglandins and bradykinin. In addition, for unexplained reasons, these patients are resistant to the effects of infused angiotensin II. Ref - Harrison's principles of internal medicine 20e pg 294, 306, 2096, 2938",D

– Mean ± 3SD (m ± 3σ) covers 99% values
In the given question,

Mean of PEFR (μ) = 300 l/min

Admission rate bias is?,Repoing bias,Response bias,Berksonian bias,None.,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Berksonian bias Selection bias Selection biases are distoion that result from procedure used to select subjects and from factors that influence study paicipation. Groups to be compared are differentially susceptible to the outcome even before the experimental maneuver is performed. Selation bias may be of following types. 1. Surveillance/detection bias A potential aifact in epidemiologic data caused by the use of a paicular diagnostic technique or type of equipment. For example, cancer rates may vary in different regions or periods, not because of an actual difference in the incidence of disease but because of different diagnostic technologies. If diagnostic test is being used in one region is more sensitive than other region, the cancer rates will be high in that region even without the existance of an actual difference. 2. Neyman survival bias (Incidence-Prevalence bias) This type of bias is due to missing of fatal cases, mild cases or cases of shoer duration from the study. For example, in a study of breaset cancer, we can choose two different types of cases : ? Incident cases - All breast cancer patients newly diagnosed during a given time. Prevalent cases - All breast cancer patients who are alive during a given time frame. These can lead to different results, because the probability of finding a case in given time frame is related to moality risk. Those patients who hay a mild form of disease and survive for a relatively long time have a good chance of being around on the date of data collection. Those patients who die quickly are unlikely to be around on that date. 3. Referrel bias or volunteer bias Volunteer or referral bias occurs because people who volunteer to paicipate in a study (or who are referred to it) are often different than non-volunteers/non referrel. This bias usually ors the treatment group, as volunteers tend to be more motivated and concerned about there health. 4. Response bias Occurs when those who respond to a survey differ in impoant ways from those who do not respond. This bias can work in either direction, i.e., if bias occurs, when those who do not respond to a survey differ in impoant ways from those who respond, it is called nonrespondent bias. 5. Berkesonian bias Berksonian bias results from the greater probability of hospital admission for people with two or more disease than for people with one disease. So, it is also known as admission rate bias. For example, If breast cancer is the exposure of interest (diseases are often treated as exposures in hospital based case-control studies) and meningioma is the case disease then people with both breast cancer and meningioma could be hospitalized for either breast cancer or mengioma or both. However, people with only breast cancer or with only mengioma could be hospitalized because of one of these disease. Therefore, a greater propoion of people in the community with both breast cancer and meningioma would be admitted to the hospital than would people with meningioma only. So, Berksonian bias occurs when both exposure (e.g., breast cancer in above example) and disease (e.g., meningioma in above example) affect selection.",C

"A 20 year old female patient has non exeional chest pain. On auscultation, she had multiple non-ejection clicks. Investigation of choice would be: September 2008",Serum markers,Chest X-ray,Electrocardiography,Echocardiography,"Ans. D: Echocardiography Ejection clicks/ ejection sounds are high-pitched sounds that occur at the moment of maximal opening of the aoic or pulmonary valves. They are heard just after the first hea sound. The sounds occur in the presence of a dilated aoa or pulmonary aery or in the presence of a bicuspid or flexible stenotic aoic or pulmonary valve. The diastolic correlate of the ejection click is the opening snap, which occurs at maximal opening of a flexibly stenotic mitral or tricuspid valve. Non ejection clicks/ midsystolic clicks occurring with or without a late systolic murmur (crescendo-decrescendo), often denotes prolapse of one/both leaflets of the mitral valve.They are best heard along the lower left sternal border and at the left ventricular apex. ECG is normal commonly in MVP, but may show biphasic/ inveed T waves inleads II, III and aVF. Echocardiography is paicularly effective in identifying the abnormal position and prolapse of the mitral valve leaflets.",D

Causes of acute flaccid paralysis,Poliomyelitis,Tick paralysis,Acute inflammatory demylination polyneuropathy,All,"The term acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is often used to describe a sudden onset, as might be found with polio. AFP is the most common sign of acute polio, and used for surveillance during polio outbreaks. AFP is also associated with a number of other pathogenic agents including enteroviruses other than polio, echoviruses, West Nile virus, and adenoviruses, among others. Botulism The Clostridium botulinum bacteria are the cause of botulism. Vegetative cells of C. botulinum may be ingested. Introduction of the bacteria may also occur endospores in a wound. When the bacteria are in vivo, they induce flaccid paralysis. This happens because C. botulinum produces a toxin which blocks the release of acetylcholine. Botulism toxin blocks the exocytosis of presynaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine (ACh).When this occurs, the muscles are unable to contract.Other symptoms associated with infection from this neurotoxin include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. Botulism prevents muscle contraction by blocking the release of acetylcholine, thereby halting postsynaptic activity of the neuromuscular junction. If its effects reach the respiratory muscles, then it can lead to respiratory failure, leading to death. Curare Curare is a plant poison derived from - among other species - Chondrodendron tomentosum and various species belonging to the genus Strychnos, which are native to the rainforests of South America. Ceain peoples indigenous to the region - notably the Macusi - crush and cook the roots and stems of these and ceain other plants and then mix the resulting decoction with various other plant poisons and animal venoms to create a syrupy liquid in which to dip their arrow heads and the tips of their blowgun das. Curare has also been used medicinally by South Americans to treat madness, dropsy, edema, fever, kidney stones, and bruises.Curare acts as a neuromuscular blocking agent which induces flaccid paralysis. This poison binds to the acetylcholine (ACh) receptors on the muscle, blocking them from binding to ACh. As a result, ACh accumulates within the neuromuscular junction, but since ACh cannot bind to the receptors on the muscle, the muscle cannot be stimulated. This poison must enter the bloodstream for it to work. If curare affects the respiratory muscles, then its effects can become life-threatening, placing the victim at risk for suffocation. Other Flaccid paralysis can be associated with a lower motor neuron lesion. This is in contrast to an upper motor neuron lesion, which often presents with spasticity, although early on this may present with flaccid paralysis. Included in AFP's list are poliomyelitis (polio), transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, enteroviral encephalopathy] traumatic neuritis, Reye's syndrome, etc. An AFP surveillance programme is conducted to increase case yield of poliomyelitis. This includes collection of 2 stool samples within 14 days of onset of paralysis and identification of virus, and control of the outbreak and strengthening immunization in that area. Historical records from the 1950s, modern CDC repos, and recent analysis of patterns in India suggest that flaccid paralysis may be caused in some cases by oral polio vaccinations Venomous snakes that contain neurotoxic venom such as kraits, mambas, and cobras can also cause complete flaccid paralysis. Some chemical warfare nerve agents such as VX can also cause complete flaccid paralysis Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2234",D

Chronic Non-Spherocytic hemolytic anemia is seen in which class of G6PD deficiency,Class I,Class II,Class III,Class IV,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Class I The four forms of symptomatic G6PD deficiency : Acute hemolytic anemia Favism Congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia Congenital nonspherocvtic hemolytic anemia Patients with class I G6PD variants have such severe G6PD deficiency that lifelong hemolysis occurs in the absence of infection or drug exposure. Such patients fall under the category of having congenital nonspherocvtic hemolytic anemia. These G6PD variants have low in vitro activity and/or marked instability of the molecule, and most have DNA mutations at the glucose-6-phosphate or NADP binding sites. These sites are central to the function of G6PD, which oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate and reduces NADP to NADPH. It is presumed that the functional defect is so severe that the red cells cannot withstand even the normal oxidative stresses encountered in the circulation. Anemia and jaundice are often first noted in the newborn period, and the degree of hyperbilirubinemia is frequently of sufficient severity to require exchange transfusion. After infancy, hemolytic manifestations are subtle and inconstant. Most individuals have mild to moderate anemia (hemoglobin 8 to 10 g/dL) with a reticulocyte count of 10 to 15 percent. Pallor is uncommon, scleral icterus is intermittent, splenomegaly is rare, and splenectomy generally is of little benefit. Hemolysis can be exaggerated by exposure to drugs or chemicals with oxidant potential or exposure to a beans. Some drugs with relatively mild oxidant potential that are safe in patients with class II or class III G6PD variants may increase hemolysis in patients with class I variants. Disease variants of Glucose 6 phosphate dehvdrogenase deficiency The World Health Organization has classified the different G6PD variants according to the magnitude of the enzyme deficiency and the severity of hemolysis. Classes IV and V are of no clinical significance. Types Features Class I Variants have severe enzyme deficiency (less than 10 percent of normal) and have chronic (nonspherocytic) hemolytic anemia. Class II Variants, such as G6PD Mediterranean, also have severe enzyme deficiency, but there are, usually only intermittent episodes of acute hemolysis associated with infection, drugs, or chemicals. Class III Variants, such as G6PD A-, have moderate enzyme deficiency (10 to 60 percent of normal) with intermittent episodes of acute hemolysis usually associated with infection, drugs, or chemicals Class IV Variants have no enzyme.deficiency or hemolysis. Class V Variants have increased enzyme activity",A

Often it stas as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time.Often episodes have no symptoms. Occasionally there may be hea palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, shoness of breath, or chest pain.The disease is associated with an increased risk of hea failure, dementia, and stroke. It is a type of supraventricular tachycardia Leads V4 and V5 of an electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation with somewhat irregular intervals between hea beats, no P waves, and a hea rate of about 150 BPM. High blood pressure and valvular hea disease are the most common alterable risk factors for AF. Other hea-related risk factors include hea failure, coronary aery disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital hea disease. In the developing world valvular hea disease often occurs as a result of rheumatic fever. Lung-related risk factors include COPD, obesity, and sleep apnea.Other factors include excess alcohol intake, tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, and thyrotoxicosis. However, half of cases are not associated with any of these risks.A diagnosis is made by feeling the pulse and may be confirmed using an electrocardiogram (ECG).A typical ECG in AF shows no P waves and an irregular ventricular rate Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1456",D

Azotemia can be prerenal, renal or postrenal. Pre renal azotemia occurs when there is a reduction in the effective aerial blood flow to the kidney, either from a reduction in extracellular volume or in conditions where effective circulating volume is reduced despite normal total extracellular volume. LAB findings include: FeNa is less than 1 %,- proximal tubular function is normal, so it reabsorbs sodium and water, so less sodium is available at the distal tubule leading to greater secretion of renin. This inturn increase aldosterone secretion and increased distal sodium reabsorption resulting in low Fractional excretion of sodium. BUN and creatinine levels are elevated.

International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of WHO, acknowledged dioxins cancer causing potential and classified it as human carcinogen. o To avoid dioxin production, no chlorinated plastic bags (and preferably no other chlorinated corn pounds) should be introduced into the incinerator. Red bags must not be incinerated as red colour contains cadmium, which causes toxic emissions. If mercury-containing items are put into a red bag for infectious waste and sent to an incinerator or other waste treatment technology, mercury will contaminate the environment. o Airborne mercury then enters a global distribution cycle in the environment, contaminating fish and wildlife. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cross the blood- brain barrier as well as the placenta. Public concerns about incinerator emissions, as well as the creation of federal regulations for medical waste incinerators, are causing many health care facilities to rethink their choices in medical waste treatment. As stated by Health Care Without Harm, an international coalition of47() organizations in 52 countries, non-incineration treatment technologies are a growing and developing field.

STOP TB Strategy was lauched in ?,2002,2006,2010,2013,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., 2006 STOP TB Strategy In 2006, WHO launched the new Stop TB Strategy. The core of this strategy is DOTS. The strategy is to be implemented over the next 10 years as described in the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015. The targets and indicators for TB control are as defined within the framework of MDGs. These will be used to measure the progress made under the stop TB strategy. It focuses onthe five principal indicators that are used to measure the implementation and impact of TB control. They are : case detection, treatment success, incidence, prevalence and deaths. The global targets for case detection and treatment success have been set by WHO's World Health Assembly. By 2015: The global burden of TB (prevalence and death rates) will be reduced by 50% relative to 1990 levels. This means reducing prevalence to 150 per 100,000 or lower and deaths to 15 per 100,000 per year or lower by 2015 (including TB cases coinfected with HIV). The number of people dying from TB in 2015 should be less than approximately 1 million, including those coinfected with HIV.

Which a vehicular injury is not caused by direct contact of vehicle ?,Primary impact,Secondary impact,Secondary injury,Rolling over,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Secondary injury Pedestrian injuries Following patterns of injuries are seen :? 1) Primary impact injuries : It is caused due to initial impact between vehicle and pedestrian. The height of the pedestrian often determines the site of impact and injuries, for example, they are usually found on head in children and on the trunk and legs in adults. Overall, the most common site is leg (85%), followed by head (50-80%) > arms > pelvis > chest or abdomen > neck and spine. 2) Secondary impact injuries : These are due to subsequent impact with the same vehicle, as may result from being lifted on to the vehicle after the initial impact:- Secondary impact injuries are also usually seen on the same side as the primary impact injuries (side facing the vehicle) when the body is thrown on the vehicle although they may be seen on other surfaces such as during ran over injuries. If the initial impact was below the centre of gravity (as occurs in adult and older child), it tends to lift the victim up onto bonnet/hood of vehicle (scooping up) or even on road behind the vehicle and cause severe head injuries, laceration (due to secondary impact or contact with windshield) and run over by passing vehicle. If the initial point of impact was at or above the centre of gravity (as occurs in children), he is directly thrown to ground (due to primary impact) and is run over by same car with consequent secondary impact under carriage injuries which may include burns from hot exhaust pipe and stains from grease oil etc. 3) Secondary injuries : These are caused by person violently falling on ground or on stationary object. These are found on pas opposite to primary impact or on head. Injuries due to contact with ground include abrasion and bruises over the face, hand, hips and legs, and laceration over the bony prominences. 4) Rolling/Runover (degloving injuries) : Caused by wheel of vehicle or rolling over the victim.

A 38 year old female presents to the physician with complaints of excessive thirst and urination for the past 4 weeks. Her appetite has been normal and she has not had diarrhea. Blood chemistry showed mildly elevated glucose and glucagon. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the left upper quadrant and an erythematous necrotizing skin eruption on her legs. Radiographic studies show a tumor in the pancreas. Which of the following cells is responsible for this lesion?,Acinar cell,Alpha cell,Beta cell,Delta cell,"The symptoms described are typical for a patient with glucagon excess. Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Increased levels are rare, usually due to carcinoma (70%) or adenoma (30%) of the islets. Two-thirds of patients with carcinoma have liver metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Increased glucagon causes a syndrome similar to diabetes mellitus, due to antagonism of insulin effects. Patients also have migratory skin rashes, alopecia, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and glossitis. Diagnosis is made by measuring glucagon. The acinar cell , the main exocrine cell of the pancreas, contains digestive enzymes. Increases in the release of these enzymes (especially amylase and lipase) occur with pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is considered an emergent medical condition. Chronic pancreatitis is associated with fibrosis and atrophy of the acinar structures. Beta cells are responsible for insulin release. An adenoma of beta cells (insulinoma) would cause hyperinsulinism. 70% are solitary and 10% are multiple. Insulinomas cause hypoglycemia, dizziness, confusion, and excessive sweating. Glucose needs to be given promptly to avoid coma and death. Diagnosis is made by finding increased insulin and hypoglycemia. Delta cells are islet cells that secrete somatostatin. Tumors producing increased somatostatin are usually malignant. Clinically, a diabetes mellitus-like syndrome occurs along with diarrhea. Diagnosis is made from elevated serum somatostatin levels, but can be difficult because of the hormone's sho half-life. Ref: German M.S. (2011). Chapter 17. Pancreatic Hormones and Diabetes Mellitus.

Recommended content of Iodine in salt at production level ?,10 ppm,15 ppm,20 ppm,30 ppm,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., 30 ppm Goitre control There are following essential components of national goitre control programme. 1. Iodized salt The iodization of salt is now the most widely used prophylactic public health measure against endemic goitre. In India the level of iodization is fixed under the Prevention of food adulteration (PFA) act and is not less than 30 ppm at the production point and not less than 15 ppm of iodine at the consumer level. Iodized salt is most economical, convenient and effective means of mass prophylaxis in endemic areas. Recently the National institure of Nutrition at Hyderabad has come out with a new product, common salt foified with iron and iodine --> two in one salt (twin foified salt or double foified salt). Iodized oil --> It is another effective method for controlling goitre. IM injection of iodized oil (mostly poppy seed oil) is given. An average dose of 1 ml will provide protection for 4 years. 2.

False about Pulse polio immunization is ?,Mop up immunization is done in restricted geographical areas,It is carried out in all children less than 5 yrs of age,Mopping up is done in areas where wild polio virus is found,AFP surveillance is done in all children < 5 years of age,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. AFP surveillance is done in all children < 5 years of age AFP surveillance is carried out in all children below 15 years of age AFP Surveillance o Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is carried out to identify all remaining infected areas, monitor progress towards eradication and target supplementary immunization appropriately. o The term AFP means paralysis of acute onset involving limbs leading to flaccidity. Poliomylelitis is most impoant etiology of AFP, other causes are - GBS (Guillain-Barre syndrome), transverse myelitis and traumatic neuritis. o AFP surveillance aims at detecting cases of AFP and repoing them immediately to district immunization officer. Surveillance is carried out for all cases of AFP and not just for poliomyelitis. All cases of AFP are repoed, regardless of the final diagnosis. As paralytic poliomyelitis is one cause of AFP, maintaining a high sensitivity of AFP repoing will ensure that all cases of paralytic poliomyelitis are detected, repoed and investigated, resulting in preventive central measures to interrupt the transmission of disease. o The aim of AFP surveillance is to detect polio virus transmission, and the earlier the stool is collected, the greater the chance of detecting polio virus. o WHO recommends the immediate repoing and investigation of every case of AFP in children less than 15 yrs (As AFP in a person > 15 yrs is unlikely to be polio. Still, AFP surveillance must be flexible enough to repo any case of AFP in an adult, if suspected to be due to poliomyelitis) Cases of AFP are classified as Polio if : Wild polio virus is isolated from any stool specimen. Cases of AFP without isolation of wild polio virus may be classified as 'polio compatible' if : Stool specimens were inadequate and Residual weakness was present 60 days after onset of paralysis or 60-day follow-up was not done (due to death or absence) and 'Expe review' concludes that these cases could not be discarded as 'non-polio' based on available data. o WI-10 recommends obtaining 2 stool samples from AFP cases within 14 days of paralysis onset and sent to WHO accredited laboratory using Reverse cold chain. Stool samples should be taken at least 24 hours apa. o All repoed cases of AFP should be investigated by District immunization officer 'within 48 hours' after notification. o AFP surveillance is evaluated by 2 key indicators : a) The sensitivity of repoing (target being non-polio AFP rate of at least 1 case per 100,000 children aged less than 15 years. this is the 'background' rate of AFP among children. Non-polio causes of AFP such as GBS, transverse myelitis, & traumatic neuritis account for this background rate.) b) The completeness of specimen collection (target being 2 adequate stool specimens from at least 80 per cent of all AFP cases). Mop-up Activity Mop-up activity is a house-to-house activity where two rounds of polio immunization, 4-6 weeks apa are conducted to limit the transmission of wild poliovirus. o Under the mop-up activity, children below 5 years of age are covered in affected and neighbouring districts around every detected positive polio case. The basic strategy for eradicating polio consists of High infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral polio vaccine in the first year of life; National Immunization Days during which every child below 5 years gets 2 additional doses of OPV on 2 days separated by 4 to 6 weeks. Surveillance of AFP to identify all reservoirs of wild polio virus transmission through repoing and laboratory testing of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children under fifteen years of age;.

B: Transmitted by aedes mosquito The Japanese encephalitis virus is a virus from the family Flaviviridae. Domestic pigs and wild birds are reservoirs of the virus; transmission to humans may cause severe symptoms. Man is an incidental dead-end host. One of the most impoant vectors of this disease is the mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus. This disease is most prevalent in Southeast Asia, especially in Japan, china, and Korea. The causative agent Japanese encephalitis virus is an enveloped virus of the genus flavivirus; it is closely related to the West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus. Positive sense single stranded RNA genome is packaged in the capsid, formed by the capsid protein. It has been noted that the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infects the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and rapidly accumulates substantial amounts of viral proteins for the JEV.

This multicenter randomized trial enrolled over 1400 patients with type 1 DM to either intensive or conventional diabetes management and prospectively evaluated the development of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. The intensive group received multiple administrations of insulin daily along with education and psychological counseling. The intensive group achieved a mean hemoglobin A1C of 7.3% versus 9.1% in the conventional group. Improvement in glycemic control resulted in a 47% reduction in retinopathy, a 54% reduction in nephropathy, and a 60% reduction in neuropathy. There was a nonsignificant trend toward improvement in macrovascular complications. The results of the DCCT showed that individuals in the intensive group would attain up to 7 more years of intact vision and up to 5 more years free from lower limb amputation. Later, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) studied over 5000 individuals with type 2 DM. Individuals receiving intensive glycemic control had a reduction in microvascular events but no significant change in macrovascular complications. These two trials were pivotal in showing a benefit of glycemic control in reducing microvascular complications in patients with type 1 and type 2 DM, respectively. Another result from the UKPDS was that strict blood pressure control resulted in an improvement in macrovascular complications Ref - pubmed.com",A

"Wernicke's encephalopathy results due to deficiency of: March 2010, September 2010, September 2012, March 2013 (b)",Thiamine,Niacin,Pantothenic acid,Cyanocobalamin,"Ans. A: Thiamine Wernicke encephalopathy is a syndrome characterised by ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, confusion, and impairment of sho-term memory. It is caused by lesions in the medial thalamic nuclei, mammillary bodies, periaqueductal and periventricular brainstem nuclei, and superior cerebellar vermis, often resulting from inadequate intake or absorption of thiamine (vitamin B1), especially in conjunction with carbohydrate ingestion. It is most commonly correlated with prolonged alcohol, amphetamine or methylphenidate consumption resulting in thiamine deficiency. Alcoholics are therefore paicularly at risk, but it may also occur with thiamine deficiency states arising from other causes, paicularly in patients with such gastric disorders as carcinoma, chronic gastritis, Crohn's disease, and repetitive vomiting, paicularly after bariatric surgery",A

True about pain of pericarditis Is,Pais increase on leaning forward,Pain decreasing on supine position,Pain increases during inspiration,Pain increasing on eating,"Ref: Harrison's 19th E pg 1571 The pain of acute pericarditis is often severe, retrosternal, and left precordial, and referred to the neck, arms, or left shoulder. Frequently the pain is pleuritic, consequent to accompanying pleural inflammation (i.e., sharp and aggravated by inspiration and coughing), but sometimes it is steady, constricting, radiates into either arm or both arms, and resembles that of myocardial ischemia; therefore, confusion with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is common. Characteristically, however, pericardial pain may be relieved by sitting up and leaning forward and is intensified by lying supine. Pain is often absent in slowly developing tuberculous, postirradiation, and neoplastic, uremic, and constrictive pericarditis.",C

It involves preventing the emergence and spread of CHD risk factors and life-styles that have not yet appeared or become endemic. This applies to developing countries in paicular. These countries should seek to preserve their traditional eating patterns and life- styles associated with low levels of CHD risk factors. Since the aetiology of CHD is multifactorial the approach to prevention should be multifactorial aimed at controlling or modifying as many risk factors as possible.

In a social group a social act which is considered natural and right is referred to as –,Taboo,Ritual,Custom,Tradition,"Terms custom and tradition are used interchangeably. But there is a difference (though minute) between these two : -
Customs

It the established patterns of behavior that can be objectively verified within a particular society.
In simple words, it is the act (social act) which is commonplace considered to be normal for that society.
It should be keep in mind that custom of one society may be strange or abnormal to other society.

Traditions 

Traditions are a daily part of our lives which is herited by other persons.
That is Tradition is a custom that is handed down. That means : -
Custom is usual behavior (social act).
When custom is handed to other persons of society, the same act (custom) becomes tradition.

Wolf Chaikoff effect -,Excess iodine intake causes hypothyroidism,Iodine induced hyper thyroidism,Thyrotoxicosis due to excessive amount of iodineingestion,Drug induced hyperthyroidism,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Excess iodine intake causes hypothyroidism o The effect of iodine on thyroid function is quite complex.o The most obvious effect of administering a high dose of iodine is a decrease in the release ofthyroid hormones.This effect is very prompt and is quicker than the action of antithyroid drugs.Hence, iodine ivas used in the treatment ofthyrotoxicosis and is still used in preparing patients for thyroid surgery.o However, the effect is not observed on repeated administration of iodine a phenomenon called 'iodine escape' the cause of which is not understood.o Administration of iodine has a triphasic response on the organification of iodine.o Inhally there is a brief increase in iodine organification.o Shortly therafter, the high intrathyroid iodide concentration inhibits iodine organification an effect known as wolff-ch iakoffeffect.o Prolonged adminstration of high dose of iodine, however produces an escape from the wolfchiakoff effect (not to be confused with iodine escape) due to autoregulation of iodine uptake by the thyroid.When iodine organification decreases due to the wolfchiakoff effect it results in inthrathyroid accumulation of iodine.The rise in intrathyroid iodide, reduces the iodine uptake (due to autoregulation).The intrathyroid iodide therefore reduces and with it the wolf-chiakoff effect subsides.If however the autoregulation is absent due to thyroid dysfuntion the wolf-chiakoff effect will persist and keep the iodine organification suppressed.Increased concentrationof plasma iodide|Increased uptake ofiodide by thyroid|iIncreased conceniraionof intrathyroid iodine|Increased organificationof iodine|Increased synthesis of T, and T4|Increased release of F, and T,",A

Refeeding edema is due to increased release of-,Growth hormone,Glucocoicoids,Insulin,Thyroxine,"Refeeding syndrome In severely malnourished individuals, attempts at rapid correction of malnutrition switch the body from a reliance on fat to carbohydrate metabolism. Release of insulin is triggered, shifting potassium, phosphate and magnesium into cells (with water following the osmotic gradient) and causing potentially fatal shifts of fluids and electrolytes from the extracellular to the intracellular compament. Rapid depletion of (already low) thiamin exacerbates the condition. Clinical features include nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, seizures, respiratory depression, cardiac arrest and sudden death. The risks of refeeding are greatest in those who are most malnourished (especially chronic alcoholics), but even those who have gone without food for 5 days can be at risk and restitution of feeding should always be done slowly, with careful monitoring of serum potassium, phosphate and magnesium in the first 3-5 days.

A 60-year-old woman comes to the emergency room in a coma. The patient's temperature is 32.2degC (90degF). She is bradycardic. Her thyroid gland is enlarged. There is diffuse hyporeflexia. BP is 100/60. Which of the following is the best next step in management?,Await results of T4 and TSH.,Obtain T4 and TSH; begin intravenous thyroid hormone and glucocorticoid.,Begin rapid rewarming.,Obtain CT scan of the head.,"The clinical picture strongly suggests myxedema coma. Unprovoked hypothermia is a particularly important sign. Myxedema coma constitutes a medical emergency; treatment should be started immediately. Should laboratory results fail to support the diagnosis, treatment can be stopped. An intravenous bolus of levothyroxine is given (200-500 mg loading dose), followed by daily intravenous doses (50-100 mg). If high doses are used, the patient should be carefully monitored for cardiac arrhythmias. Impaired adrenal reserve may accompany myxedema coma, so parenteral hydrocortisone is given concomitantly. Intravenous fluids are also needed but are less important than thyroxine and glucocorticoids; rewarming should be accomplished slowly, so as not to precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. If alveolar ventilation is compromised, then intubation may also be necessary. Hyponatremia and an elevated PCO2 are laboratory markers of severe myxedema. CT of the head would not be the first choice, since a structural brain lesion would not explain the hypothermia, diffuse goiter, or hyporeflexia seen in this case.",B

Hypokalamia is associated with ?,Alkalosis,Periodic paralysis,Type 1 A,Organophosphate poisoining,"Pathophysiology Hypokalaemia is generally indicative of abnormal potassium loss from the body, through either the kidney or the gastrointestinal tract. Renal causes of hypokalaemia can be divided into those with and those without hypeension. Hypokalaemia in the presence of hypeension may be due to increased aldosterone secretion in Conn's syndrome (p. 674) or a genetic defect affecting sodium channels in the distal nephron (Liddle's syndrome). Excessive intake of liquorice or treatment with carbenoxolone may result in a similar clinical picture, due to inhibition of the renal 11bHSD2 enzyme, which inactivates coisol in peripheral tissues. associated with organophospharus poisoning If blood pressure is normal or low, hypokalaemia can be classified according to the associated change in acid-base balance. Inherited defects in tubular transpo should be suspected when hypokalaemia occurs in association with alkalosis, provided that diuretic use has been excluded. One such disease is Bater's syndrome, in which sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle is defective, usually due to a loss-of-function mutation of the NKCC2 transpoer. The clinical and biochemical features are similar to those in chronic treatment with furosemide. In Gitelman's syndrome there is a loss-of-function mutation affecting the NCCT transpoer in the early distal tubule. The clinical and biochemical features are similar to chronic thiazide treatment. Note that while both Bater's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterised by hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia, urinary calcium excretion is increased in Bater's syndrome but decreased in Gitelman's syndrome, analogous to the effects of the loop and thiazide diuretics, respectively, on calcium transpo (see Box 14.9). If hypokalaemia occurs in the presence of a normal blood pressure and metabolic acidosis, renal tubular acidosis (proximal or 'classical' distal) should be suspected (p. 364). When hypokalaemia is due to potassium wasting through the gastrointestinal tract, the cause is usually obvious clinically. In some cases, when there is occult induction of vomiting, the hypokalaemia is characteristically associated with metabolic alkalosis, due to loss of gastric acid. If, however, potassium loss has occurred through the surreptitious use of aperients, the hypokalaemia is generally associated with metabolic acidosis. In both cases, urinary potassium excretion is low unless there is significant extracellular volume depletion, which can raise urinary potassium levels by stimulating aldosterone production. Hypokalaemia can also be caused by redistribution of potassium into cells as the result of insulin, b-adrenoceptor agonists and alkalosis, or as the result of K+ flux into muscle in hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, which is associated with mutations in several genes that regulate transmembrane ion flow into muscle cells. Finally, reduced dietary intake of potassium can contribute to hypokalaemia but is seldom the only cause, except in extreme cases. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 361",D
ORS required during 4 hours in a 20 kg child,200-400 ml,400-600 ml,600-800 ml,1200-2200 ml,"ORSThe aim of oral rehydration therapy is to prevent dehydration and reduce moality.Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit.At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. The inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of the direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water.More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution.A freshly prepared ORS should be used before 24hrs.Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 mOsm/l improved the efficacy of ORS regimen for children with acute non-cholera diarrhoea.Reduced osmolarity ORS:-(g/L)Sodium chloride- 2.6Glucose,anhydrous- 13.5Potassium chloride- 1.5Trisodium citrate,dihydrate-2.9Total =20.5 g/LReduced osmolarity ORS:-(mmol/L)Sodium-75Chloride-65Glucose,anhydrous-75Potassium-20Citrate-10Total = 245 mmol/LGuidelines for oral rehydration therapy in first four hours(as per weight)1.

Most cost-effective method of infection control is:,Repeated disinfectant use,Alcohol based rubbing,Prophylactic antibiotic therapy,Hand washing,"Ans. d. Handwashing (Ref: Park 22/e p323)In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and even eood nutrition.HandwashingHandwashing is like a 'do-it-yourself vaccine--it involves five simple and effective steps (Wet. Lather, Scrub, Rinse. Dry) you can take to reduce the spread of diarrheal and respiratory illness so you can stay healthy.Medical handwashing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands.Hands should be rubbed together with digits interlocking.Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel.After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids recontaminating the hands from those surfaces.The purpose of handwashing in the health care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ('germs') & avoid transmitting them.The World Health Organization has 'Five Moments' for washing hands:* Before patient care * Before an aseptic task* After environmental contact* After patient care* After exposure to blood-body fluids The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap confers killing action to a hand washing agent. Such killing action may be desired prior to performing surgery or in settings in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent.To 'scrub' one's hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels for drying the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for scrubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails.All jewelry should be removed. This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes. Long scrub-times (10 minutes) are not necessary.When rinsing, water on the forearms must be prevented from running back to the hands.Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap.Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap.But soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing HIN1 influenza A virus & Clostridium difficile spores from hands.Effectiveness:Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.",D

Treatment of acute cardiac tamponade is,Emergency paracentesis,Emergency thoracotomy,Pericardiactomy,IV fluids,"Initial management in hospital is by pericardiocentesis. This involves the inseion of a needle through the skin and into the pericardium and aspirating fluid under ultrasound guidance preferably. This can be done laterally through the intercostal spaces, usually the fifth, or as a subxiphoid approach.A left parasternal approach begins 3 to 5 cm left of the sternum to avoid the left internal mammary aery, in the 5th intercostal space. Often, a cannula is left in place during resuscitation following initial drainage so that the procedure can be performed again if the need arises. If facilities are available, an emergency pericardial window may be performed instead] during which the pericardium is cut open to allow fluid to drain. Following stabilization of the person, surgery is provided to seal the source of the bleed and mend the pericardium. In people following hea surgery the nurses monitor the amount of chest tube drainage. If the drainage volume drops off, and the blood pressure goes down, this can suggest tamponade due to chest tube clogging. In that case, the person is taken back to the operating room for an emergency reoperation. If aggressive treatment is offered immediately and no complications arise (shock, AMI or arrhythmia, hea failure, aneurysm, carditis, embolism, or rupture), or they are dealt with quickly and fully contained, then adequate survival is still a distinct possibility.

Hemiparesis is NOT a feature of,Carotid aery occlusion,MCA occlusion,ACA occlusion,Veebral aery occlusion,"Altered mental status is a common presenting complaint in the emergency depament (ED). Cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) are one of the most serious etiologies for altered mental status. Ischemic stroke accounts for 87% of CVAs.1 Of these, approximately 20% are the result of veebrobasilar aery occlusion (VBAO). The moality of VBAO can reach 80-95% without successful treatment. Making the diagnosis can be difficult as patients present with a variety of nonspecific signs and symptoms. Fuhermore, the posterior circulation is difficult to visualize, often requiring the use of computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). We present here a review of the literature and a case of a young patient with VBAO. There are a number of conditions that can cause hemiparesis or hemiplegia.

Hypokalemia is seen with -,Frusemide,Coisol,Metabolic acidosis,Amiloride,"Furosemide also can lead to gout caused by hyperuricemia. Hyperglycemia is also a common side effect. The tendency, as for all loop diuretics, to cause low serum potassium concentration (hypokalemia) has given rise to combination products, either with potassium or with the potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride (Co-amilofruse). Other electrolyte abnormalities that can result from furosemide use include hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia. In the treatment of hea failure, many studies have shown that the long-term use of furosemide can cause varying degrees of thiamine deficiency, so thiamine supplementation is also suggested. Although disputed, it is considered ototoxic: 'usually with large intravenous doses and rapid administration and in renal impairment'.

Do not distinguish between causes and associated factors5. No risk to subjects5. Not suited to the evaluation of therapy or prophylaxis of disease6. Allows the study of several different aetioiogical factors (e.g., smoking, physical activity and personality characteristics in myocardial infarction)6. Another major concern is the representativeness of cases and controls7. Risk factors can be identified. Rational prevention and control programmes can be established 8.

Which of the following may be seen in Multiple Myeloma:,Decreased Calcium,Sclerotic bone lesion,Bone deposition,Renal failure,Answer is D (Renal failure) Renal failure occurs in nearly 25% of Myeloma patients and some renal pathology is noted in over half. Multiple Myeloma is associated with Lvtic bone lesion and Bone Resorption The bone lesions of Myeloma are caused by activation of osteoclasts that destroy bone and suppression of osteoblasts that form bone. Bone lesions are thus lytic in nature and not sclerotic. There is a net resorption of bone and not bone deposition. Multiple Mveloma is associated with Hypercalcemia and not Hypocalcemia Hypercalcemia is caused by substantial mobilization of calcium from bone due to associated bony lysis.,D
Which of the following trace element cannot be completely supplemented by diet in pregnancy,Fe,Ca+,Zn,Manganese,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Fe The demand of iron during pregnancy is markedly increased. This is mostly limited to the second half of pregnancy specially to the last 12 weeks. An adequate balanced diet provides about 18 - 20 mg of iron. The amount of iron absorbed from the diet and that mobilized from the store arc inadequate to meet the demand. Note that this is so despite the fact that absorption of iron through the gut is enhanced during pregnancy. o This also explains the need for iron supplementation and also why it is limited mostly to the second half.",A
Spider nevi are due to action of -,Estrogen,Androgen,Steroids,Progesterone,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Estrogen o Spider nevi refer to dilated, visible small blood vessels in the skin.# It is called spider nevi because it consists of central 'feeding' blood vessel with numerous fine radiating legs emanating from the central body.o Spider nevi are caused due to vasodilatation of vessels and are usually associated with cirrhosis.o Cirrhosis is associated with vasodilatation and hyperdynamic circulation.o 'The cause of vasodilatation in c hr rhas is is uncertain but it is believed to be related to the increased level of estrogen in the body.

Schirmer's test is done to assess the function of which of the following cranial nerve ?,Oculomotor nerve,Optic nerve,Facial nerve,All,"The Schirmer's tear test is used to assess lacrimation function of facial nerve. Schirmer's test determines whether the eye produces enough tears to keep it moist. This test is used when a person experiences very dry eyes or excessive watering of the eyes. It poses no risk to the subject. A negative (more than 10 mm of moisture on the filter paper in 5 minutes) test result is normal. Both eyes normally secrete the same amount of tears. It is performed with the help of a 5 x 35 mm strip of Whatman-41 filter paper which is foldei 5 mm from one end and kept in the lower fornix at the junction of lateral one-third and medial two-thirds. The patient is asked to look up and not to blink or close the eyes. A young person normally moistens 15 mm of each paper strip. Because hypolacrimation occur with aging, 33% of normal elderly persons may wet only 10 mm in 5 minutes. Persons with Sjogren's syndrome moisten less than 5 mm in 5 minutes. How to read results of the Schirmer's test: *Normal which is >15 mm wetting of the paper after 5 minutes. *Mild which is 14-9 mm wetting of the paper after 5 minutes. *Moderate which is 8-4 mm wetting of the paper after 5 minutes. *Severe which is <4 mm wetting of the paper after 5 minutes.",C
Number of teeth can be counted by all the following methods except -,Gustafson method,Mile method,Boyde method,Frame method,"Ans. is `d' i.e., Frame method Age from teeth after 20 years Teeth eruption is useful for age estimation upto about 18 years, beyond which it is just a guess work. The methods used are :? A. Gustafson's method : Useful only in persons older than 21 years of age, depending on the physiological changes in each of the dental tissues. 1. Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel). 2. Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent pa of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis). 3. Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, sta from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis. 4. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde). 5. Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root sta at apex and extend upward (may be pathological). 6. Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria). B. Mile's method : Age can be known by changes of root transparency. C. Boyde' method : On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at bih (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination. D. Stack's method : Age of infant can be known from height and weight of erupting teeth.",D
A 29-years-old male taking oral hypoglycemic drug never had ketonuria in his life. His BMI is 20.5. His grandfather had diabetes and his father who is only son of his grandfather did not have the disease. Which type of DM this person will be most likely -,pancreatic,MODY,Type I,TypeII,"A number of unusual genetic diseases are associated with diabetes. In rare families, diabetes is caused by single gene defects with autosomal dominant inheritance. These subtypes constitute less than 5% of all cases of diabetes and typically present as 'maturity-onset diabetes of the young' (MODY), i.e. non-insulin-requiring diabetes presenting before the age of 25 years (Box 21.6). Very rarely, diabetes can develop at or soon after bih. This neonatal diabetes is usually genetic in origin, with 50% due to mutations in the KATP channel of the pancreatic b cell causing insulin deficiency and diabetic ketoacidosis. However, sulphonylurea drugs overcome the defect in potassium channel signalling, so that insulin therapy is not necessary in these cases.

Alveolar hyproventilation is observed in ?,Gullian-Barre syndrome,Acute asthma,Bronchiectasis,CREST syndrome,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Guillian-Barre syndrome Neuromuscular diseases that can cause alveolar hypoventilation include myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillian-Barre syndrome, and muscular dystrophy. Patients with neuromuscular disorders have rapid, shallow breathing secondary to severe muscle weakness or abnormal motor neuron function. The central respiratory drive is maintained in patients with neuromuscular disorders. Thus, hypoventilation is secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. Chest wall deformities such as kyphoscoliosis, fibrothorax, and those occurring postthoraco-plasty are associated with alveolar hypoventilation leading to respiratory insufficiency and respiratory failure. Hypoventilation is not uncommon in patients with severe COPD. Alveolar hypoventilation in COPD usually does not occur unless the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is less than IL or 35% of the predicted value.

In this situation, serum T4 is low and TSH is elevated, usually in excess of 20 mU/L. Measurements of serum T3 are unhelpful since they do not discriminate reliably between euthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Secondary hypothyroidism is rare and is caused by failure of TSH secretion in an individual with hypothalamic or anterior pituitary disease. Other non-specific abnormalities are shown in Box 20.9. In severe, prolonged hypothyroidism, the electrocardiogram (ECG) classically demonstrates sinus bradycardia with low-voltage complexes and ST segment and T-wave abnormalities.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with infection caused by -,Hepatitis C virus,Hepatitis E virus,Hepatitis G virus,Hepatitis A virus,"Hepatitis C infection is usually identified in asymptomatic individuals screened because they have risk factors for infection, such as previous injecting drug use , or have incidentally been found to have abnormal liver blood tests. Although most people remain asymptomatic until progression to cirrhosis occurs, fatigue can complicate chronic infection and is unrelated to the degree of liver damage. Hepatitis C is the most common cause of what used to be known as 'non-A, non-B hepatitis'. If hepatitis C infection is left untreated, progression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis occurs over 20-40 years. Risk factors for progression include male gender, immunosuppression (such as co-infection with HIV), prothrombotic states and heavy alcohol misuse. Not everyone with hepatitis C infection will necessarily develop cirrhosis but approximately 20% do so within 20 years. Once cirrhosis has developed, the 5- and 10-year survival rates are 95% and 81%, respectively. One-quaer of people with cirrhosis will develop complications within 10 years and, once complications such as ascites develop, the 5-year survival is around 50%.

"A 45-year-old chronic alcoholic male is brought to the emergency department with an alleged history of assaulting his neighbor. On examination, he is found to have irrelevant talk. He had not consumed alcohol for the past 4 days. He is diagnosed as a case of delirium tremens. In this condition, the person is:",Criminally responsible for his act,Partially responsible for his act,Has diminished responsibility of his act,"Not responsible for his act under section 84, IPC","Ans. d. Not responsible for his act tinder section 84, IPC (Ref: Reddy 33/e p493, 29/e p432)'Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that involves sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes. It is considered as unsoundness of mind and not of intoxication. Thus if delirium tremens can be proved, the person cannot be held responsible for his offence under section 84 of the lPC.''Section 84 lPC states that: Nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mid, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to the law.''McNaughton's RuleAn accused person is not legally responsible, if it is clearly proved, that at the time of committing the crime, he was suffering from such a defect of reason from abnormality of mid, that he did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or that what he was doing was wrong.Section 84 IPC states that: Nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mid, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to the law.'The insanity must be directly related to the offence in such a way as to satisfy the court that the mental abnormality had a direct causative relationship to the offence, and that the offence would not have occurred if there was no mental abnormality.It is necessary to show that the intellectual or cognitive faculties of the accused were so disordered, that his reasoning powers as to the facts and actions were not functioning normally.It must be clearly established that a defect of reason resulted from the 'abnormality of the mind'. The abnormality of the mind is any disease which is capable of producing mental dysfunction.However, when mental dysfunction is attributable to external factors (e.g. alcohol and drugs consumed voluntarily), this is not called abnormality of the mind.It is usually assumed to mean one of the major functional or organic psychoses.",D

Most common cause of hypercalcemic crisis is -,Carcinoma breast,Parathyroid hyperplasia,Parathyroid adenoma,Paget's disease,"<p>Hypercalcemia due to malignancy is common (occurring in as many as 20% of cancer patients, especially with ceain types of tumor such as breast cancer), often severe and difficult to manage, and, on rare occasions, difficult to distinguish from primary hyperparathyroidism. Although malignancy is often clinically obvious or readily detectable by medical history, hypercalcemia can occasionally be due to an occult tumor. Previously, hypercalcemia associated with malignancy was thought to be due to local invasion and destruction of bone by tumor cells; many cases are now known to result from the elaboration by the malignant cells of humoral mediators of hypercalcemia.

The first laboratory test that becomes abnormal in acute hepatocellular failure is:,Prothrombin time (PT),APTT,Decreased Albumin,Increased Aerial Ammonia,"Answer is A (Prothrombin time (PT)): An increased prothrombin time is the most frequently observed first laboratory test suggesting the possibility of hepatocellular failure. Early liver failure may be suspected based on isolated prolongation of the Prothrombin Time (PT). Patients with early hepatocellular failure may present with isolated prolongation of PT Prolonged PT is an early sensitive indicator of hepatic synthetic dysfunction due to the sho half life offactor VII (2-6 hours) vvhich the failing liver cannot maintain. APTT is prolonged after PT in Liver Disease. Albumin has a long half life of about 20 days and hence reduced albumin will manifest only after 20 days of onset of Reduced synthetic function of Liver. Increased aerial ammonia is also a sign of acute liver failure, however increased aerial ammonia is primarily vieved as an impoant factor in the development of hepatic encephalopathy. 'Patient with liver disease may have only a prolonged PT (normal APTT and thrombin time) reflecting a decrease in factor VII which is the. first to be reduced in liver disorders because of its sho half life of 2-6 hours' 'Factor Vila is an essential enzyme in the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. The pathway is evaluated by PT. Because factor VII has the shoest half life of the procoagulant proteins, patient with early liver disease may present with an isolated prolonged PT' - Hematology / Oncology Secrets / 82 `Increased Prothrombin Time has a high prognostic value, paicularly for patients with acute hepatocellular failure. An abnormal prothrombin lime with confirmed prolongation of more than 5-6 seconds above control is the single laboratory test that draws attention to the possibility of the development offlummant hepatic necrosis (acute hepato cellular failure) in the course of acute viral hepatitis. Such a prolonged prothrombin time often precedes by days the manifestations of liver failure' - Schiff's Disease of the Liver 1011/52 'Most coagulation factors are produced in the liver (except VWF) and development of liver disease may result in prolongation of both PT and APTT. However because factor VII (Extrinsic pathway; measured by PT) has the shoest half life amongst all vitamin K dependent factor. PT will be the first to be prolonged. Development of Liver disease will lead to deficiency offactor VII first and initial prolongation of only the Prothrombin Time.

"All are causes of pulmonary hypertension except,",Hyperventilation,Morbid obesity,High altitude,Fenfluramine,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hyperventilation There are three main causes of pulmonary hypertension:-Cardiac diseasesRespiratory diseasePulmonary thromboembolic diseaseCardiac diseasesLead to pulmonary hypertension by increasing pulmonary blood flow (e.g., large left to right shunt) or by increasing pulmonary venous pressure (e.g., L. V. failure).In Respiratory diseases,The predominant mechanism for the pulmonary hypertension is an increase in resistance to pulmonary blood flow arising from perivascular parenchymal changes coupled with pulmonary vasoconstriction due to hypoxia.In pulmonary thromboembolic disease,Clots in pulmonary vessels increase resistance to blood flow causing pulmonary hypertension.Now about other options mentioned in the question.Alveolar hyperventilationPulmonary hypertension is seen in Alveolar hypoventilation (not hyperventilation).In patients with alveolar hypoventilation the primary pathogenic mechanism responsible for pulmonary hypertension is alveolar hypoxia potentiated by respiratory acidosis. (alveolar hypoxia leads to constriction of pulmonary vessels).Regardless of the etiology, whether pulmonary hypertenstion will occur in patients with alveolar hypoventilation depends on whether there is sufficient alveolar and arterial hypoxia to raise pulmonary arterial pressure considerably.In sleep apnea syndrome seen in obese individualsSevere arterial hypomexia occurs during sleep due to hypoventilation (apnea). This causes pulmonary hypertension during sleep. After some point of time, the pulmonary hypertension may continue even during the day time.AnorexiantsPulmonary hypertension has been associated with anorexiants.'A causal relationship has been established between exposure to several anorexigens including aminorex and fenfluramine and development of pulmonary artery hypertension.

Salt losing nephritis is a feature of -,Interstitial nephritis,Renal amyloidosis,Lupus nephritis,Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis,"Acute interstitial nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an immune-mediated disorder, characterised by acute inflammation affecting the tubulo- interstitium of the kidney. It is commonly drug-induced, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) fast becoming the most common cause, but can be caused by other toxins, and can complicate` a variety of systemic diseases and infections . Clinical features The clinical presentation is typically with renal impairment but, in some patients with drug-induced AIN, there may be signs of a generalised drug hypersensitivity reaction with fever, rash and eosinophilia. Proteinuria is generally modest (PCR < 100 mg/mmol) and tubular in type ). The urine may contain white blood cells and white cell casts but is sterile on culture. Eosinophils are present in up to 70% of patients but this is a non-specific finding. AIN should` always be considered in patients with non-oliguric AKI. There` `may be a rapid deterioration of renal function in some cases of drug-induced AIN, causing the condition to be mistaken for RPGN. Investigations Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis . This typically shows evidence of intense inflammation, with infiltration of the tubules and interstitium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. Eosinophils may also be observed, especially in drug-induced AIN. Often granulomas may be evident, especially in drug-induced AIN or sarcoidosis . The degree of chronic inflammation in a biopsy is a useful predictor of long-term renal function. Eosinophiluria may be present but is not a good discriminator for AIN. Management Some patients with drug-induced AIN recover following withdrawal of the drug alone, but high-dose glucocoicoids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day) may accelerate recovery and prevent long-term scarring. Other specific causes should be treated, if possible. Chronic interstitial nephritis Chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) is characterised by renal dysfunction with fibrosis and infiltration of the renal parenchyma by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages, in association with tubular damage.

Best for diagnosing carcinoid tumour is,24 hour urinary HIAA,24 hour catecholamine,24 hour vaniylmandelic acid,24 hour metanephrine levels,"Conventional tumour pathology criteria and dna cytometry have limited value in assessing the malignancy of a neuroendocrine tumour. Hence, the detection of substances that are more specific for carcinoid tumours can facilitate a more exact diagnosis. Two markers are primarily used to diagnose and follow carcinoid tumours: 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid (5-hiaa) and chromogranin A (CgA). Serotonin released by carcinoid tumours is metabolized by monoamine oxidases in the liver, lungs, and brain to 5-hiaa. When measured in a 24-hour urine sample, 5-hiaa level has a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 100% for diagnosing carcinoid . The normal range for urinary 5-hiaa is 3-15 mg/24 h, but the figure may vary depending on the laboratory . Chromogranin A is found in the wall of synaptic vesicles that store serotonin and glucagons. Levels of CgA tend to correlate with tumour bulk but not with symptoms. In general, CgA levels are elevated in 85%-100% of patients with carcinoid tumour, regardless of whether the tumour is functional or nonfunctional. Ref - pubmed.com",A

Which is not used in pasteurization,Phosphatase test,Methylene blue test,Coliform count,Standard plate count,"Tests of pasteurized milk (1) Phosphatase test : This test is widely used to check the efficiency of pasteurization. The test is based on the fact that raw milk contains an enzyme called phosphatase which is destroyed on heating at a temperature which corresponds closely with the standard time and temperature required for pasteurization. At 60 deg C for 30 minutes phosphatase is completely destroyed. Consequently, the test is used to detect inadequate pasteurization or the addition of raw milk. (2) Standard plate count : The bacteriological quality of pasteurized milk is determined by the standard plate count. Most countries in the West enforce a limit of 30,000 bacterial count per ml of pasteurized milk. (3) Coliform count : Coliform organisms are usually completely destroyed by pasteurization, and therefore, their presence in pasteurized milk is an indication either of improper pasteurization or post-pasteurization contamination.

Symptoms that do occur are generally caused by abnormal hea rhythms or arrhythmias, most commonly a form of ventricular tachycardia called Torsades de pointes. If the arrhythmia reves to a normal rhythm by itself then the affected person may experience a faint known as syncope, which may be associated with seizures and sinus bradycardia. However, if the arrhythmia continues, the affected person may experience a cardiac arrest leading to sudden death. The arrhythmias that lead to faints and sudden death are more likely to occur in response to specific circumstances, in pa determined by which genetic variant is responsible for the condition. While arrhythmias can occur at any time, in some forms of LQTS arrhythmias are more commonly seen in response to exercise or mental stress (LQT1), in other forms following a sudden loud noise (LQT2) , and in some forms during sleep or immediately upon waking (LQT3).

A 68-year-old man presents with a syndrome of alcohol withdrawal. ECG Shows?,Atrial flutter,Atrial fibrillation,PSVT,VT,"Ans. (a) Atrial flutter.* This ECG reveals a regular narrow complex tachycardia at a rate of 150 beats/min. Coarse sawtooth waves are seen best in the inferior leads diagnostic of atrial flutter with 2 to 1 AV conduction.* Whenever a supraventricular tachycardia at a rate of close to 150 beats/ min is present, the diagnosis of atrial flutter should be considered. The QRS axis is normal, and there is no clear evidence of ischemia.* Typical atrial flutter is caused by a macro-reentrant circuit in the right atrium, involving the tricuspid annulus. Structural heart disease, intrinsic lung disease, and states of increased sympathetic tone can all predispose to this arrhythmia.",A

Phosphatase test in milk is done to know -,Quality of pasteurization,Contamination of milk,Nutritive value,Coliform count,"Tests of pasteurized milk (1) Phosphatase test : This test is widely used to check the efficiency of pasteurization. The test is based on the fact that raw milk contains an enzyme called phosphatase which is destroyed on heating at a temperature which corresponds closely with the standard time and temperature required for pasteurization. At 60 deg C for 30 minutes phosphatase is completely destroyed. Consequently, the test is used to detect inadequate pasteurization or the addition of raw milk. (2) Standard plate count : The bacteriological quality of pasteurized milk is determined by the standard plate count. Most countries in the West enforce a limit of 30,000 bacterial count per ml of pasteurized milk. (3) Coliform count : Coliform organisms are usually completely destroyed by pasteurization, and therefore, their presence in pasteurized milk is an indication either of improper pasteurization or post-pasteurization contamination.

A continuous murmur is heard in all of the following conditions except-,Ventricular septal defect with aoic regurgitation,Patent ductus aeriosus,Coronary aeriovenous fistula,Valsalva aneurysm,"A continuous murmur is predicated on a pressure gradient that persists between two cardiac chambers or blood vessels across systole and diastole. The murmurs typically begin in systole, envelop the second hea sound (S 2 ), and continue through some poion of diastole. They can often be difficult to distinguish from individual systolic and diastolic murmurs in patients with mixed valvular hea disease. The classic example of a continuous murmur is that associated with a patent ductus aeriosus, which usually is heard in the second or third interspace at a slight distance from the sternal border. Other causes of a continuous murmur include a ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm with creation of an aoic-right atrial or right ventricular fistula, a coronary or great vessel aeriovenous fistula, and an aeriovenous fistula constructed to provide dialysis access.

Bar diagramLength of the bars, drawn vertical or horizontal, indicates the frequency of a character. Bar may be drawn in ascending or descending order of magnitude. Spacing between any two bars should be nearly equal to half of the width of the bar. There are four types of bar diagrams,a) Simple bar diagram:Here bars can be arranged vertically or horizontally. A suitable scale must be used to present the length of the bars.b) Multiple bar diagram:Here two or more bars are grouped together.c) Component bar diagram:The bars may be divided into two or more parts. Each part represents a certain item.d) Proportional bar diagram:Each bar represents 100%. The bars may be divided into two or more parts. Each part is proportional to the magnitude of that particular itemHeight, weight, blood pressure1. Histogram - To construct a histogram the class intervals are plotted along X axis (horizontal line) and corresponding frequencies (or no. of observations) on Y-axis (vertical line). Rectangles are constructed such that height of a rectangle is proportional to the frequency of class and width is equal to length of the class. If all classes are of equal length then all the rectangles will have equal width. Histogram is an area diagram.2. Pie diagramThe frequencies of the groups are shown in a circle. Degrees of angle denote the frequency and area of the sector. Size of each angle is calculated by the formula as: Angle (Degrees) = Class frequency X 360deg/Total observations2. Frequency polygon - It is an area diagram of frequency distribution developed over a histogram. Join the midpoints of class intervals at the height of frequencies by straight lines. It gives a polygon, i.e., figure with many angles.3. Pictogram -- It is a popular method of presenting data to the layman. Here each picture indicates a unit of characteristic. These charts can be used for illiterate persons. Because of its attractive presentation it can be utilized for the man on the street.3. Frequency curve - when the no. of observations is very large and group intervals are reduced, the frequency polygon tends to lose angulations giving place to a smooth curve known as frequency curve.4. Spot map - These maps are prepared to show geographical distribution of frequencies of characteristic4. Line chart - This is a frequency polygon presenting variations by line. It shows the trend of an event occurring over a period of time-rising, falling or showing fluctuations. Cumulative frequency curve (Ogive) - Successive class frequencies are added and a frequency polygon is drawn. Number or percent of observations falling below or above a specific value can be presented in this graph. Any point below which there are certain percent of observations is called as percentile and graph drawn out of such points is a 'percentile graph'.5. Scatter (Correlation) diagram: It is graphic representation made to show the nature of correlation between two variable characters X and Y in the same person(s) or group(s) such as height and weight in men aged 20 years, hence it is also called correlation diagram. The characters are read on the base (X-axis) and vertical (Y-axis) and the perpendiculars drawn from these readings meet to give one scatter point. Varying frequencies of the characters give a number of such points or dots that show a scatter. A line is drawn to show the nature of correlation at a glance.",C
"In basic life suppo (BLS), suppo is given to which of the following organ-",Lung,Hea,Kidney,Skeletal muscle,"Basic life suppo, more popularly known as CPR, is intended to maintain organ perfusion until definitive interventions can be instituted. The elements of CPR are the maintenance of ventilation of the lungs and compression of the chest. Mouth-to-mouth respiration may be used if no specific rescue equipment is immediately available (e.g., plastic oropharyngeal airways, esophageal obturators, masked Ambu bag). Conventional ventilation techniques during single-responder CPR require that the lungs be inflated twice in succession after every 30 chest compressions. Recent data suggest that interrupting chest compressions to perform mouth-to-mouth respiration may be less effective than a continuous chest compression strategy. Chest compression is based on the assumption that cardiac compression allows the hea to maintain a pump function by sequential filling and emptying of its chambers, with competent valves maintaining forward direction of flow. The palm of one hand is placed over the lower sternum, with the heel of the other resting on the dorsum of the lower hand. The sternum is depressed, with the arms remaining straight, at a rate of approximately100 per minute. Sufficient force is applied to depress thesternum 4-5 cm, and relaxation is abrupt. ref:harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2247",A

"A patient in regular rhythm presents with absent P waves on ECG Leads II, III and AVF reveal a Saw-Tooth pattern. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis",Atrial Fibrillation,Atrial Flutter with Variable Block,Atrial Flutter with Fixed Block,Multifocal Atrial Tachecardia,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Atrial Flutter with Fixed Block The absence of any discernible P waves on ECG together with the presence of Saw Tooth Flutter wave in inferior leads (Leads II, III and AVF) strongly suggests a diagnosis of Atrial Flutter. The presence of a regular rhythm suggests a Fixed Block. Atrial flutter is characterized by rapid atrial rate. The ventricular rate varies depending upon the degree of A. block. The rhythm originates in one atrial focus, resulting from circuit reentry mechanism. On the ECG P waves lose their normal appearance due to the rapid atrial rate. The waves blend together in a sawtooth configuration called flutter waves (the hallmark characteristic of rhythm). The patient develops a regular atrial rhythm. This variation is the ventricular response is irregular Saw tooth P waves (regular atrial rhythm) Irregular Regular ventricular ventricular rhythm rhythm Atrial flutter with variable block Atrial flutter with fixed block",C

Right Frontal lobe lesion leads to,Impaired left conjugate gaze,Impaired right conjugate gaze,Impaired upward conjugate gaze,Impaired downward conjugate gaze,"(A) Impaired left conjugate gaze# Conjugate gaze refers to the eyes working in unison. A disorder of conjugate gaze means that patients are unable to look in certain directions with both eyes, such as upward, downward or laterally.> Centre for lateral conjugate gaze is seen in frontal lobe cortices & in occipital lobe cortices.> Frontal lobe centres for lateral conjugate gaze lie in the posterior aspect of frontal lobes.> They are quite close to the motor cortex and hence conjugate deviation of the eyes is seen in a number of paralytic strokes.> Frontal lobe centre for lateral conjugate gaze control voluntary conjugate eye movements to the opposite side. Teleologically, this makes sense: the left half of the brain 'sees' space on the right side, therefore the left side of the brain controls movements of the right arm and leg, as well as eye movements to the right side.> In one side of frontal lobe centre destruction, as in a cerebral infarct, the tonic impulses from the opposite frontal lobe cause a deviation of the eyes towards the side of the lesion and patient looks to- wards the lesion and away from the paralyzed side.> Conjugate deviation occurs only in acute phase of an infarct and eventually the patient will recover, but there may be an intermediate stage where they are unable to move the eyes away from the lesion on command, yet able to follow an object to the opposite side.> Occipital lobe centre for lateral gaze control the ability of the eyes to follow an object to the opposite side.> In a patient with destruction of the right frontal centre but with an intact right occipital lobe centre cannot look to the left on command, but may be able to follow an object to the left.> If the patient is unable to follow a moving object, such as a finger, you can assess the occipital lobe centre by having them fixate on an immobile object while you move their head.> Remember! Lesions of occipital centre for lateral conjugate gaze are less common than lesions of frontal centre for lateral conjugate gaze.> Brainstem centre for lateral conjugate gaze are in the pons, very close to the sixth nerve nuclei.> The right frontal centre connects with the left pontine centre, and the left frontal centre with the right pontine centre. The left pontine centre controls lateral conjugate eye movement to the left, and the right pontine centre controls lateral conjugate eye movement to the right.> Thus, a patient who has a destruction of one pontine centre will look away from the lesion and towards the paralyzed side because of the unopposed action of the opposite pontine centre. Recovery of conjugate gaze after a brainstem lesion is unusual.",A

According to 'Biomedical concept' health is,Relative absence of pain and discomfo,Absence of disease,"A sound mind in sound body, in a sound family, in sound environmen",None.,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Absence of disease There are following changing concepts of health:? 1. Biomedical concept According to this concept health is defined as 'absence of disease', and has the basis in the 'germ theory of disease' The limitation of this concept is that it has not given much significance to environmental, social, psychological and cultural determinants. 2. Ecological concept According to this concept, health is a dynamic equilibrium between man and his environment, and disease a maladjustment of human to environment. According to Dubos 'health implies the relative absence ofpain and discomfo and a continuous adaptation and adjustment to the environment to ensure optimal function'. The ecological concept raises two issues, i.e. imperfect man and imperfect environment. 3. Psychological concept it includes the influence of social, psychological, cultural, economic and political factors. 4. Holistic concept The holistic model is a synthesis of all the above concepts. This view corresponds to the view held by the ancients that 'health implies a sound mind, in a sound body, in a sound family, in sound environment.' The holistic approach implies that all sectors of society have an effect on health, in paicular, agriculture, animal husbandry, food, industry, education, housing, public works and communication.

Which of the following abnormalities would most likely be found in this patient?,Apical cavitary lesions on x-ray,Curschmann spirals in his sputum,Elevated salt levels in his sweat,Increased Reid index,"This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of acute infection (elevated temperature, greenish-yellow sputum) on a background of chronic bronchitis, which is common in smokers. Hyperplasia and hyperophy of mucous glands in chronic bronchitis causes them to be present at deeper levels in the bronchial wall than usual. The ratio of the gland depth to the total thickness of the bronchial wall is termed the Reid index, which would be increased in this patient. Apical cavitary lesions might be indicative of cavitary tuberculosis. This condition is not associated with excessive mucus production. Hemoptysis and weight loss might also be expected as clinical findings. Curschmann spirals are found in asthmatic patients and represent mucus casts of small airways. This patient does not have the typical episodic history of acute asthmatic attacks with acute dyspnea as the major clinical problem. Elevated sodium chloride levels in sweat are present in cystic fibrosis. This condition has an onset in early life and is associated with excessive production of thick mucus, which predisposes to infection of the airways and permanent damage. Ref: Saavedra M.T., Nick J.A.

It is freely filtered by the glomerulus, but also actively secreted by the peritubular capillaries in very small amounts such that creatinine clearance overestimates actual GFR by 10-20%Creatinine clearance (Cc) is calculated from the creatinine concentration in the collected urine sample (U ), urine flow rate (V), and the plasma concentration (P ). Since the product of urine concentration and urine flow rate yields creatinine excretion rate, which is the rate of removal from the blood, creatinine clearance is calculated as removal rate per min (U x V) divided by the plasma creatinine concentration.

A group of expes discussing a topic in front of the audience without any specific order. This mode of communication is known as: September 2008,Panel discussion,Group discussion,Team presentation,Symposium,"Ans. A: Panel discussion In panel discussion there is a chairman/moderator and 4-8 speakers. Each speaker prepares separately, the other speakers hear one another for the time at the session itself. Panel discussions, however, differ from team presentations. Their purpose is different. In a team presentation, the group presents agreed-upon views; in a panel discussion, the purpose is to present different views. Also in a team presentations, usually speakers stand as they speak; in panel discussions, usually speakers sit the whole time. Technically, a panel discussion consists of questions and answers only, and a symposium consists of a series of prepared speeches, followed by questions and answers. The chairman/ moderator must monitor time and manage questions. If each paicipant is making a speech for a set period of time, he should signal the speakers at the one minute to go mark and at the stop mark. If a speakers goes more than one or two minute he can stop them to gave the equal rights to each speakers. The chairman/ moderator must be a biased person; he is neither in our nor against the topic.

"A 42 year old male has strong positive Benedict's test, random blood sugar is > 163 mg%, fasting blood sugar is >200 mg% Next line of investigation is-",Urine glucose chaing 5 hourly,OralGTT,Repeat benedict's test,24 hr urine sugar estimation,"Urine testing Glucose -Testing the urine for glucose with dipsticks is a common screening procedure for detecting diabetes. If possible, testing should be performed on urine passed 1-2 hours after a meal to maximise sensitivity. Glycosuria always warrants fuher assessment by blood testing (see below). The greatest disadvantage of urinary glucose measurement is the individual variation in renal threshold for glucose. The most frequent cause of glycosuria is a low renal threshold, which is common during pregnancy and in young people; the resulting 'renal glycosuria' is a benign condition unrelated to diabetes. Another disadvantage is that some drugs (such as b-lactam antibiotics, levodopa and salicylates) may interfere with urine glucose tests. Ketones -Ketone bodies can be identified by the nitroprusside reaction, which measures acetoacetate, using either tablets or dipsticks. Ketonuria may be found in normal people who have been fasting or exercising strenuously for long periods, who have been vomiting repeatedly, or who have been eating a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrate. Ketonuria is therefore not pathognomonic of diabetes but, if associated with glycosuria, the diagnosis of diabetes is highly likely. In diabetic ketoacidosis (p. 811), ketones can also be detected in plasma using test sticks (see below). Protein -Standard dipstick testing for albumin detects urinary albumin at concentrations above 300 mg/L, but smaller amounts (microalbuminuria, see Box 17.13, p. 476) can only be measured using specific albumin dipsticks or by quantitative biochemical laboratory measurement. Microalbuminuria or proteinuria, in the absence of urinary tract infection, is an impoant indicator of diabetic nephropathy and/or increased risk of macrovascular disease (p. 830). Blood testing Glucose- Laboratory glucose testing in blood relies upon an enzymatic reaction (glucose oxidase) and is cheap, usually automated and highly reliable. However, blood glucose levels depend on whether the patient has eaten recently, so it is impoant to consider the circumstances in which the blood sample was taken. Blood glucose can also be measured with colorimetric or other testing sticks, which are often read with a poable electronic meter. These are used for capillary (fingerprick) testing to monitor diabetes treatment (p. 810). There is some debate as to whether selfmonitoring in people with type 2 diabetes improves glycaemic control. Many countries now only offer selfmonitoring to people with type 2 diabetes taking blood glucose concentration should be estimated using an accurate laboratory method rather than a poable technique.Glucose concentrations are lower in venous than aerial or capillary (fingerprick) blood. Whole blood glucose concentrations are lower than plasma concentrations because red blood cells contain relatively little glucose. Venous plasma values are usually the most reliable for diagnostic purposes (Boxes 21.10 and 21.11). Ketones -Blood ketone monitoring is increasingly available. Urinary ketone measurements described above are semi-quantitative, difficult to perform and retrospective (i.e. the urine has accumulated over several hours), and do not measure the major ketone in blood during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (bOHB). Whole blood ketone monitoring detects b-OHB and is useful in assisting with insulin adjustment during intercurrent illness or sustained hyperglycaemia to prevent or detect DKA. Blood ketone monitoring is also useful in monitoring resolution of DKA in hospitalised patients (Box 21.7). Glycated haemoglobin Glycated haemoglobin provides an accurate and objective measure of glycaemic control integrated over a period of weeks to months. In diabetes, the slow non-enzymatic covalent attachment of glucose to haemoglobin (glycation) increases the amount in the HbA1 (HbA1c) fraction relative to nonglycated adult haemoglobin (HbA0). These fractions can be separated by chromatography; laboratories may repo glycated haemoglobin as total glycated haemoglobin (GHb), HbA1 or HbA1c. In most countries, HbA1c is the preferred measurement. The rate of formation of HbA1c is directly propoional to the ambient blood glucose concentration; a rise of 1% in HbA1c corresponds to an approximate average increase of 2 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) in blood glucose. Although HbA1c concentration reflects the integrated blood glucose control over the lifespan of erythrocytes (120 days), HbA1c is most sensitive to changes in glycaemic control occurring in the month before measurement.

What is the significance of mutation of CCR5 protein?,High resistance to HIV infection,High susceptibility to HIV infection,Causes resistance to anti retroviral therapy,Causes increased virulence of the virus,"The answer to this question is definitely 'A'.Let me explain why. HIV infects T cells that carry CD4 antigen on their surface i.e CD4 T cells.In addition HIV can also affect macrophages that bear CD4 on their surface. The first step in the HIV infection is the binding of envelope glycoprotein of HIV to the CD4 receptor on the T cells/macrophages.How ever this interaction alone is not sufficient for entry and infection of the virus. It needs a second receptor i.e a co-receptor.HIV has two coreceptors- CCR5 CXCR4. Therefore HIV must bind to CD4 receptor and one of the above coreceptor to enter into the cell. Any damage to these coreceptors will prevent HIV from entering the cell, thus leading to resistance to HIV infection. A well known example is a mutation of CCR5 which is called delta 32 mutation. Those persons with this mutation is resistant to HIV infection because HIV virus cannot bind to this mutated CCR5 and therefore cannot enter the cell.",A

SIADH true is all except?,Serum Na can be as low as 135,Urine sodium is normal or slightly low,Vaptans are new FDA approved drugs for its Rx,Water loading test can be used,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Urine Na+ is normal or slightly low Clinical criteria to diagnose SIADHDecreased plasma osmolarity (<280 mosm/kg)Hyponatremia (dilutional hyponatremia with Na+ <135 mmolAbsence of fluid volume depletion.In appropriate urinary osmolarity >150 mosm/Kg.Increased urinary sodium excretion >30 meq/L. While on normal salt and water intake.Water loading test in SIADHA water loading or ADH testing is sometimes performed in patients with hyponatremiaIn this test specific quantities of water is given to the patient and the amount of urine produced and the changes in urine osmolarity and blood osmolarity are monitored.With this test the patients with SIADH typically show decreased serum sodium and osmolality but not normal urine sodium and quantity of urine.They do not produce as much urine as expectedA normal person should excrete >90% of the water load within 4 hours whereas patients with SIADH are not able to excrete more than 20-30% of the water loadThe urine osmolality is high relative to serum osmolality.This suggests that patients do not excrete adequate water load.Management of SIADHGeneral principles used in the management of SIADH Fluid restriction It is the mainstay of the treatment of most patients with SIADH with a suggested goal intake of less than 800 ml/day.In addition to fluid restriction the therapy of SIADH associated hyponatremia often requires the administration of sodium chloride either as oral tablets or intravenous saline.When using intravenous saline, the osmolality of the administered fluid must be greater than the osmolality of urine (This is achieved by administering hypertonic saline).Among patients with urine osmolality more than twice the plasma osmolality, a loop diuretic may be used to reduce urinary concentration.Vasopressor receptor antagonist (Vaptans)Vasopressor receptor antagonists increases free water excretion without the loss of any sodium or potassium.Intravenous conivaptan (which is used in hospitalized patients) and oral tolvaptan are available and approved for use in patients with hyponatremia due to SIADH.The utility of vaptan therapy is limited byExcessive thirstProhibitive cost (at least in the united states) andThe potential for overtly rapid correction of hyponatremia which has led to the necessity for hospitalization for the initiation of therapy.Only one of the vasopressor antagonist i.e. conivaptan has been approved for short term in hospital I. V. treatment of SIADH and the hyponatremia of congestive heart failure.Others are currently in phase III trials.Choosing, the appropriate therapyThe choice of therapy in patients with hyponatremia due to SIADH varies with the severity of hyponatremia and the presence or absence of symptoms. a) Patients with severe hyponatremia who present with seizures or other severe neurological abnormalities or with symptomatic hyponatremiaIn these cases urgent intervention with hypertonic saline is requiredIn these patients the serum sodium has fallen below 120 meq/L in less than 48 hrs leading to potentially fatal cerebral edema.These patients require urgent interventionIt consists of 100 ml bolus of 3% saline - If neurological symptoms persist or worsen100 ml bolus of 3%saline can be repeatedHypertonic saline preserve cerebral perfusion and prevent complications from hyponatremia induced brain edema, swelling.The intravenous hypertonic saline increases serum sodium concentration by approximately 1.5 meq/L and 2.0 meq/L in women.Mild to moderate symptomsLess severe neurological symptoms (e.g. dizziness, gait disturbance, forget fullness, confusion, lethargy)These are seen in patients with a serum sodium concentration below 120 meq/L that develops over more than 48 hrs.Initial therapy in these patients depends in part upon the severity of symptoms.Confusion and lethargyThese patients require initial administration of hypertonic saline therapy. The serum sodium should be raised at the rate of 1meqLL/hour for three to four hours.For patients with mild symptoms (forget fullness, gait disturbances)These patients do not require administration of hypertonic saline.In these patients the initial therapy consists of fluid restriction and oral salt tablets.Asymptomatic hyponatremiaThese patients have serum sodium b/w 120-129 meqLL.These patients are often treated only with fluid restriction.However, some of these seemingly asymptomatic patients have subtle neurological manifestation that can interfere with the quality of life and that may be improved by raising the serum sodium by the following methods.VaptansSaltsLoop diuretics (in patients with urine osmolality more than twice that of the plasma)Goal of serum sodium * Serum sodium should be maintained at 130 meq/L or higher in patients with SIADH because of possible presence of subtle neurologic manifestations and falls when the serum sodium is b/w 120-129 meq/L.",B

It paicularly affects children, tourists and immunosuppressed individuals, and is the parasite most commonly impoed into the UK. In cystic form, it remains ble in water for up to 3 months and infection usually occurs by ingesting contaminated water. Its flagellar trophozoite form attaches to the duodenal and jejunal mucosa, causing inflammation. Clinical features and investigations After an incubation period of 1-3 weeks, there is diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weakness, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. On examination, there may be abdominal distension and tenderness. Chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption may occur, with bulky stools that float. Stools obtained at 2-3-day intervals should be examined for cysts. Duodenal or jejunal aspiration by endoscopy gives a higher diagnostic yield. The 'string test' may be used, in which one end of a piece of string is passed into the duodenum by swallowing and retrieved after an overnight fast; expressed fluid is then examined for the presence of G. lamblia trophozoites. A number of stool antigen detection tests are available. Jejunal biopsy specimens may show G. lamblia on the epithelial surface.

Cu 380A should be replaced once in,4years,6years,8years,10years,"Change of IUDs Ine IUDs such as Lippes Loop may be left in place as long as required, if there are no side-effects. Copper devices cannot be used indefinitely because copper corrodes and mineral deposits build up on the copper affecting the release of copper ions. They have to be replaced periodically. The same applies to the hormone-releasing devices. This is an inherent disadvantage of medicated devices when they are used in large national family planning programmes. The Cu-T -380A is approved for use for 10 years. However, the Cu-T -380A has been demonstrated to maintain its efficacy over at least 12 years of use. The Cu-T -200 is approved for 4 years and the Nova T for 5 years. The progesterone-releasing IUD must be replaced every year because the reservoir of progesterone is depleted in 12-18 months. The levonorgestrel IUD can be used for at least 7 years, and probably 10 years.

Following is not true regarding summons ?,It is a legal document,No conduct money is paid to the doctor in criminal cases,Section 61 - 69 CrPC deal with summons,None of the above,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., None of the above All are true. Summon Summon is a legal document compelling attendance of a witness in a cou of law under penalty, on a paicular day, time and place, for the purpose of giving evidence. It is issued by the Cou in writting, in duplicate, signed by presiding officer of cou and bears the seal of the cou. Conduct money refers to the travelling and daily expences to reach the cou. In civil cases, it is paid by the pay calling him, at the time of serving the summon. Judge decides the conduct money in civil case. The summon in civil case can be ignored if conduct money is not sanctioned or if the amount is less, and the witness can bring the fact to notice of judge. In criminal cases, no money is paid along with summon. The witness can ask for it, after giving evidence, but he should not insist if the cou is not willing to sanction, since otherwise he can be charged for contempt of cou. To an independent doctor it is always paid (known as bhatta), while the doctor in government service, can claim from his office. In case, two or more summons are received for the same date and time, the principles for preference of summon are: Criminal case is preferred over civil case. If both cases are criminal/civil, summon from higher cou is preferred. If both cases are criminal/civil and from cou of same status, summon received earlier is preferred. However, in each situation other cou is informed accordingly.",D

Incised wound It is a clean cut through the tissues (usually, skin and subcutaneous tissue), caused by sharp-edged object, which is longer than its depth, when the weapon is struck or pressed and drawn across the body pa, i.e., there is pressure and friction. Examples of sharp edged object are knife, blade, razor, scalpel, sword, chopper etc. The characteristic features of incised wound are : Length is the greatest dimension (most impoant). Hair, hair bulb, nerve and vessels are cut bleeding is profuse as vessels are cut. Width of injury is more than the thickness of blade, due to gaping of wound. Langer's line of skin determines gaping : gaping is more when cut is across these lines. Margins are eveed, clear, and clean cut. Clean incised wounds heal by primary intention, whereas diy, infected or large wounds heal by secondary intention, with scar formation. Hesitation cuts (Tentative cuts or trial cuts) are characteristic features of suicidal attempt.

That means positive or negative emotional feeling of an event, object or situation. Amongst the given options two have emotional components: Attitude Effects of emotional components (affect) on attitude also show the impoance of affective content. In general, people with positive mood tend to like things more than people in a neutral or negative mood. Attitude is usually fixed and stable --> not influenced by motivation. Practive (Habit) Practice refers to an established way of doing things. It is the usual way of action and on accustomed act performed without thinking. While the term habit is used far individual actions, the term practice is generally used for a set of fixed hahits. Practices (Habits) are usually formed as a result of positive emotional valence (intrinsic attractiveness). Examples ofliabit/practice in the field of health include (few examples): i) Good habits: hand washing prior to eating, exercise etc ii) Bad habits: Smoking, drinking. By motivation, bad habits can be conveed into good ones --> Habits are influenced hr, motivation. So, Attitude has emotional component but attitude is not influenced by motivation (fixed and stable) Practice/habit has emotional component and Practice / habit can be influenced by motivation.",C

Down's syndrome is,Triploidy,Monosomy,Trisomy,Aneuploidy,"Ans. c (Trisomy). (Ref Harrison, Medicine, 18th/Ch. 62. Chromosome Disorders)Clinically, the most important of numerical abnormality is trisomy 21, the most frequent cause of Down syndrome.Depending on the maternal age structure of the population and the utilization of prenatal testing, the incidence of trisomy 21 ranges from 1/600 to 1/1000 livebirths, making it the most common chromosome abnormality in live-bom individuals.Like most trisomies, the incidence of trisomy 21 is highly correlated with maternal age, increasing from about 1/1500 livebirths for women 20 years of age to 1/30 for women 45 years.In addition to trisomy 21, only two other autosomal trisomies, 13 and 18, occur with any frequency in livebirths.Incidence rates for trisomies 13 and 18 in livebirths are 1/20,000 and 1/10,000, respectively. Unlike trisomy 21 that is associated with near-normal life expectancy, both trisomies 13 and 18 are associated with death in infancy, typically occurring during the first year of life.Three sex chromosome trisomies the 47,XXX, 47,XXY (Klinefelter's syndrome), and 47,XYY conditions are quite common, with each occurring in about 1/2000 newborns. Of all the trisomic conditions, three have fewest phenotypic complications. In fact, with the exception of infertility in klinefelter's sundrome, it is likely that most individuals with such trisomies may go undetected.TableNumerical chromosomal abnormalities includePolyploidye.g. triploidy = haploid x 3 (69XYY =23x3 common but lethal)AneuploidyAny chromosome number, which is not an exact multiple of haploid number e.g., Down syndrome 47 XY+ 21 or Klinefelter syndrome 47 XXY.TrisomyState of having three representatives of a given chromosome instead of the usual pair, as in trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).",C

Felt needs is needs that the people feel about themselves.
If a health programme is based on 'felt needs' people will gladly participate in the programme, and only then it will be a people's programme.
Very often, there are groups who may have health needs of which they are not aware.
The health educator will have to bring about a recognition of the needs before he proceeds to tackle  them.

Using simple words

Most common site of primary impact injury topedestrians in a motor vehicle accident is...,Abdoemn,Legs,Head,Chest,"legs Three types of injuries are seen in pedestrians in a motor vehicles injury. 1. Primary impact injuries (the first pa struck) - These injuries are caused by the first impact between the vehicle and the pedestrian. 2. Secondary impact injuries (fuher injuries by the same vehicle) - These injuries are d/t subsequent impact with the same vehicle, for eg. the pedestrian may be lifted on to the vehicle after the initial impact. 3. Secondary injuries (sometimes also called teiary injuries) - These are the injuries caused d/t the victim falling on the ground or other stationary object. In primary impact injuries, the site and nature of injuries depend on the height of the pedestrian and upon the position of the person in relation to the vehicle when struck, i.e. whether crossing the road from one side to the other walking with or against the traffic. The injuries also depend upon the relative heights of various pas of the vehicle, i.e. bumper, radiator, fenders. In a typical case, the victim is struck by the front of the vehicle. An adult usually sustains injuries on the legs and a child on the head. Fracture of the tibia and, fibula of one or both legs is k/a bumper fracture. - The fracture is usually spiral or wedge shaped. The base of the triangular fragment of bone indicates the site of the impact and the apex points in the direction in which the vehicle was travelling. - In a bumber fracture, the distance from the heel to the ,fracture sire gives information regarding height of the bumper and whether brakes were applied or not. When brakes are applied before the accident, the legs are injured at a lower level. (The .front bumber tends to rise during acceleration and dip under braking. If the pedestrian is hit from the side, there may be unilateral fracture of the nearest leg. If the pedestrian is facing the vehicle. he may sustain intra-abdominal injuries and/or injuries to the chest wall and thoracic contents. Sometimes the pelvis is fractured.",B

True about Dextrain -,Cause Rouleaux formation,Impair factor VIIIO function,Sugar level,) Improve microcirculation,"The reversible aggregation of human red blood cells (RBC) continues to be of interest in the field of hemorheology because RBC aggregation is a major determinant of the in vitro rheological propeies of blood. Enhanced aggregation increases low shear blood viscosity and the degree of non-Newtonian behavior (1,2). In addition, the in vivo flow dynamics and flow resistance of blood are influenced by RBC aggregation (3), and marked increases of RBC aggregation have been observed in several diseases associated with vascular disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypeension). Measures of RBC aggregation, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), are commonly used as diagnostic tests and as one index to the efficacy of therapy. For example, ESR is measured during drug therapy for rheumatoid ahritis, and has been shown to be normalized by improved glycemic control in diabetes (4). There is now general agreement regarding the correlations between elevated levels of fibrinogen or other large plasma proteins and enhanced RBC aggregation, and the effects of molecular mass and concentration for neutral polymers have been repoed (5). However, the specific mechanisms involved in RBC aggregation have not been fully elucidated, and thus it is not yet possible to fully understand the relations between pathology and altered RBC aggregation. RBC form multicell linear or branched aggregates in vitro when they are suspended in either plasma or solutions containing large polymers (e.g., dextran >=40 kDa); RBC aggregates also form in vivo in regions of low flow or stasis and, hence, in regions of low shear. These linear forms are often termed rouleaux because they resemble a stack of coins. It is impoant to note that RBC aggregation is a reversible process, with aggregates dispersed by mechanical or fluid flow forces and then reforming when the forces are removed. Conversely, RBC agglutination and blood coagulation are irreversible processes due to either protein polymerization or strong antigen-antibody attractive forces. RBC aggregation is primarily determined by the type and concentration of polymers in solution or the plasma level of large proteins and by RBC aggregability (i.e., the intrinsic cell characteristics affecting RBC aggregation) In blood, the protein fibrinogen is a primary determinant of blood viscosity due to its strong tendency to increase both plasma viscosity and RBC aggregation In the past, most repos have primarily examined the ability of plasma proteins to promote aggregation; for example, higher fibrinogen levels have been linked to elevated blood viscosities in hypeensive patients Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1079",A
SIADH - all are features except -,"Decreased sodium, maintaining the concentrating ability of the urine osmolality (> 100 mOsm)",Normal sodium balance maintained indicating excess urinary sodium is due to efficient sodium intake,Hypouricemia,Low blood oressure due to volume depletion,"Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a condition in which the body makes too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This hormone helps the kidneys control the amount of water your body loses through the urine. SIADH causes the body to retain too much water . Actions of ADH Osmoregulation The most impoant and primary function of ADH is to maintain the plasma tonicity, primarily by an alteration in water balance. Osmoreceptors detect the change in effective plasma osmolality in the hypothalamus. A decrease in tonicity prevents ADH release and prevents water retention. An increase in tonicity causes ADH release, which acts on V2 receptors on the luminal surface of coical and medullary collecting tubular cells. Under the influence of ADH, unique aquaporin-2 water channels are formed by the fusion of pre-formed cytoplasmic vesicles in the tubular cells and water is absorbed down the concentration gradient. Once the water is absorbed, these channels are removed by endocytosis and returned to the cytoplasm. In patients with SIADH, levels of ADH are high even in the presence of decreased plasma osmolality and/or hyponatremia. Excess water absorption keeps the blood volume high or normal. Volume Regulation An acute drop in blood pressure as sensed by ' volume receptors' rather then 'osmoreceptors' causes ADH release (along with other hormones like rennin and epinephrine) which generates free water absorption from the kidneys. This can potentially lead to hyponatremia and a decrease in effective ECF osmolality. So, the main focus in rapid and/or substantial decrease in blood volume is 'volume regulation,' even at the cost of osmolality. This affect is more prominent in patients with liver disease or cardiac disease, and hyponatremia in such patients is the direct predictor of a worse prognosis Clinical manifestations of SIADH can be due to hyponatremia and decreased ECF osmolality which causes the water to move into the cells causing cerebral edema. Signs and symptoms depend upon the rate and severity of hyponatremia and the degree of cerebral edema. The earliest clinical manifestations of acute hyponatremia include nausea and malaise, which may be seen when the serum sodium concentration falls below 125 to 130 mEq/L (normal 135 to 145mEq/L). Vomiting is an ominous sign for patients with acute hyponatremia. With a more severe and acute fall in sodium concentration, headache, lethargy, obtundation, and eventually, seizures can occur. Coma and respiratory arrest can occur if the serum sodium level falls below 115 to 120 mEq/L. Acute hyponatremic encephalopathy may be reversible, but permanent neurologic damage or death can occur, paicularly in premenopausal women. Chronic hyponatremia allows cerebral adaptation, and the patients remain asymptomatic despite a serum sodium concentration below 120mmol/L. Nonspecific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, gait disturbances, memory and cognitive problems, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, and muscle cramps can occur with chronic hyponatremia. Sign and symptoms or mild and chronic hyponatremia are often subtle and missed during history and physical examination. Nausea and vomiting effect approximately one-third of patients with chronic hyponatremia who have a serum sodium concentration less then 120 mmol/L. The Idiopathic SIADH is more common in patients over 65 years of age, and mild to moderate hyponatremia in such patients may contribute to fractures in addition to a higher risk of falls and gait problems.

Test quoted as highly sensitive means ?,High false positive and high false negative,High false positive & low false negative,Low false positive & low false negative,Low false positive and high false negative,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., High false positive & low false negative When a screening test is used to diagnose a disease, the test oucome can be positive (diseased) or negative (healthy), while the actual health status of the person may be different. In that setting True positive - Diseased people correctly diagnosed as diseased. False positive - Healthy people wrongly identified as diseased. True negative - Healthy people correctly identified as healthy. False negative Diseased people wrongly identified as healthy. There are two major statistical measures for the validity of a screening test : ? Sensitivity It is the ability of a test to identify correctly all those who have the disease, i.e., true positive. In other words sensitivity measures the precentage of sick people who are identified as having disease. For example if a test is 90% sensitive, that means out of 100 diseased people, it will diagnose 90 (90% of diseased people will be diagnosed). Remaining 10% will be wrongly indentified as not having the disease, i.e., false negative. Specificity It is the ability of a test to identify correctly those who do not have the disease i.e., true negative In other words specificity measures the percentage of well people who are identified as not having the disease. For example, a 90 percent specificity means that 90% of nondiseased people will be identified as not having the disease. The remaining 10% will be wrongly classified as diseased, i.e., false positive.",B

Demographic divided is due to -,Increase fertility,Decrease fertility,Decrease in death rate,None.,"Demographic window

The period of time in a nation's demographic evolution when the proportion of population of working age group (15-55 years) is particularly prominent people < 15 years of age are less than 30% and > 65 years of age are less than 15%.
The demographic window opportunity lasts for 30-40 years (i.e. from the age of 15 to age of 55).
Demographic window of India is expected from 2010 to 2050

Demographic dividend

A rise in the rate of economic growth due to a rising share of working age people in a population.
It occurs when fertility rate falls. Lets see why :-

Because of mechanical link between fertility levels and age structure, when the birth rate (fertility) falls, the age pyramid first shrinks with gradual lower proportion of young population (under 15 years) and proportion of population in working age group increases. This has following effects -
i)  The respective nation has demographic window.
Output per capita rises as population in working age group is prominent and dependency ratio (child dependency ratio) is decreased.
In other words, decrease fertility rate is responsible for demographic dividend and demographic window.
Demographic gift

This the gift due to decreased fertility rate.
That means favorable effects (demographic dividend) of decrease in fertility rate.

Demographic transition

A model used to explain the process of transition from high birth rate & death rate to low birth rate & death rate.

Demographic trap

This trap is the population growth due to high birth rate and low death rate.

Demography bonus

The term demography bonus connotes the period when the dependency ratio in a population declines because of decline in fertility, until it starts to rise again because of increasing longevity.

Demographic burden

It is the increase in the total dependency ratio during any period of time, mostly caused by increased old age dependency ratio.",B

"In PML, all of the following are seen except -",Retinoic acid is used in treatment,15/17 translocation may be seen,CD 15/34 both seen in same cell,Associated with Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DFVC),"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML, APL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a cancer of the white blood cells. In APL, there is an abnormal accumulation of immature granulocytes called promyelocytes. The disease is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARa or RARA) gene and is distinguished from other forms of AML by its responsiveness to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; also known as tretinoin) therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia was first characterized in 1957 by French and Norwegian physicians as a hyperacute fatal illness,with a median survival time of less than a week.Today, prognoses have drastically improved; 10-year survival rates are estimated to be approximately 80-90% according to one study Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor-alpha gene on chromosome 17 (RARA). In 95% of cases of APL, retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene on chromosome 17 is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) on chromosome 15, a translocation denoted as t(15;17)(q24;q21). The RAR receptor is dependent on retinoic acid for regulation of transcription. Eight other rare gene rearrangements have been described in APL fusing RARA to promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF also known as ZBTB16), nucleophosmin(NPM1), nuclear matrix associated (NUMA1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5B), protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1a (PRKAR1A), factor interacting with PAPOLA and CPSF1 (FIP1L1), BCL6 corepressor (BCOR) or oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold containing 2A (OBFC2A also known as NABP1) genes. Some of these rearrangements are ATRA-sensitive or have unknown sensitivity to ATRA because they are so rare; STAT5B/RARA and PLZF/RARA are known to be resistant to ATRA. The fusion of PML and RARA results in expression of a hybrid protein with altered functions. This fusion protein binds with enhanced affinity to sites on the cell's DNA, blocking transcription and differentiation of granulocytes. It does so by enhancing interaction of nuclear co-repressor (NCOR) molecule and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Although the chromosomal translocation involving RARA is believed to be the initiating event, additional mutations are required for the development of leukemia. RAR-a/PLZF gene fusion produces a subtype of APL that is unresponsive to tretinoin therapy and less responsive to standard anthracycline chemotherapy hence leading to poorer long-term outcomes in this subset of patients Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 922",C
Which of the following is a feature of primary hyperparathyroidism ?,Reversible growth of parathyroid gland,Irreversible growth of parathyroid gland,Hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia,Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia,"Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by autonomous secretion of PTH, usually by a single parathyroid adenoma, which can vary in diameter from a few millimetres to several centimetres. It should be distinguished from secondary hyperparathyroidism, in which there is a physiological increase in PTH secretion to compensate for prolonged hypocalcaemia (such as in vitamin D deficiency, p. 1126), and from teiary hyperparathyroidism, in which continuous stimulation of the parathyroids over a prolonged period of time results in adenoma formation and autonomous PTH secretion (Box 20.39).

"Cholestatic jaundice is associated with all of the following, except:",Predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia,Minimal biochemical changes of parenchymal liver damage,A moderate to marked increase in serum alkaline phosphatase,A moderate to marked increase in SGOT,"Clinical features comprise those due to cholestasis itself, those due to secondary infection (cholangitis) and those of the underlying condition. Obstruction of the bile duct drainage due to blockage of the extrahepatic biliary tree is characteristically associated with pale stools and dark urine.  
 
Pruritus may be a dominant feature and can be accompanied by skin excoriations. Peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease are absent. If the gallbladder is palpable, the jaundice is unlikely to be caused by biliary obstruction due to gallstones, probably because a chronically inflamed, stone-containing gallbladder cannot readily dilate. This is Courvoisier’s Law, and suggests that jaundice is due to a malignant biliary obstruction (e.g. pancreatic cancer). Cholangitis is characterised by ‘Charcot’s triad’ of jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and fever. Cholestatic jaundice is characterised by a relatively greater elevation of ALP and GGT than the aminotransferases.

Cholestatic jaundice is associated with predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. There is minimal biochemical changes in parenchymal liver damage.",D

It is a prospective study of 297 samples received from clinically suspected cases of leptospirosis for DFM and IgM ELISA. We tried to evaluate the easily available technique, DFM. We got promising results with DFM. Specificity and sensitivity were observed to be 61% and 60%, respectively, alone and 95.8% efficacy when combined with IgM ELISA. Thus, DFM should be tried for where other diagnostic tools are not easily available. It is an easy and rapid technique, which can help in the early diagnosis and management of patients.

Statistical analysis of data of various studies done in same matter is called as -,Meta analysis,Data review,Propaganda,Cohort study,"Ans. is 'a'i.e., Meta analysis Meta analysiso Meta-analysis refers to the analysis of analyses. It is the statistical analysis of a collection of individual studies,o Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for amalgamating, summarising, and reviewing previous quantitative research. By using meta-analysis, a wide variety of questions can be investigated, as long as a reasonable body of primary research studies exist. Selected parts of the reported results of primary studies are entered into a database, and this 'meta-data' is 'meta-analyzed', in similar ways to working with other data - descriptively and then inferentially to test certain hypotheses.o The appeal of meta analysis is that it in effect combines all the research on one topic into one large study with many participants. The danger is that in amalgamating a large set of different studies the construct definitions can become imprecise and the results difficult to interpret meaningfully,o In a meta-analysis, research studies are collected, coded, and interpreted using statistical methods similar to those used in primary data analysis. The result is an integrated review of findings that is more objective and exact than a narrative review. By accumulating results across studies, one can gain a more accurate representation of the population relationship than is provided by the individual study estimators.",A

Following is not used in the management of Post dural headache -,Propped up position,Sumatriptan,Hydration,Epidural blood patch,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Propped up position * Supine (recumbent) position and not propped up is recommended for the management of post dural headache.* Post dural puncture headache is due to CSF leak. Typical location is bifrontalor occipital.* Headache gets worsen on sitting or upright posture and is relieved by lying down position and abdominal pressure - The hallmark of postdural puncture headache i.e., association with body position.* The onset of headache is usually 12-72 hours following the procedure, however, it may be seen almost immediately. In most cases it lasts for 7-10 days.* PDPH is believed to result from leakage of CSF from a dural defect and decreased ICT. Loss of CSF at a rate faster that it can be produced causes traction on structure supporting the brain, particularly dura and tentorium. Traction on cranial nerve (particularly 6th nerve) produces diplopia.* Factors that increase the incidence of PDPH are young age, female sex, Pregnancy, large bore needle and multiple punctures. Timing of ambulation has no effect on incidence of PDPH* Use of small bore needle can prevent PDPH.* Intially conservative treatment is given which includes analgesics (NSAIDs), oral or i.v. fluids, Sumatriptan, cosyntropin, caffeine and recumbent position.* If conservative treatment fails, epidural blood patch can be used. It involves injecting 15-20 ml of autologous blood into the epidural space which stop leakage of CSF by coagulation and mass effect.",A
"A Patient with sho PR interval and Delta waves on ECG presents to the emergency depament with Atrial Fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate. He is hemodynamically stable. All of the following agents may be used in the management, except:",Verapamil,Procainamide,Ibutilide,Amiodarone,"Answer is A (Verapamil) AV nodal blocking agents such as Calcium channel blockers, Beta blockers and Digoxin should not be used to treat Atrial Fibrillation in patients with WPW Syndrome. Use of these drugs may result in an acute increase in rate over the Accessory pathway placing the patient at risk for development of VF. Procainamide is the drug of choice for treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in patients with WPW Syndrome who are hemodynamically stable. Ibutilide and Amiodarone are also effective. Treatment of Hemodynamically Stable Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with WPW Syndrome Procainamide is the drug of choice for treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in patients with WPW Syndrome who are hemodynamically stable. Ibutilide and Amiodarone are also effective. Avoid AV nodal blocking agents such as Calcium channel blockers, Beta blockers and Digoxin The standard treatment of atrial fibrillation is to slow the ventricular rate with AV nodal blocking agents such as Calcium channel blockers, Beta blockers and Digoxin. In Patients with Pre-excitation (WPW Syndrome) the use of these agents should be avoided (contraindicated). Atrial Fibrillation in patients with WPW Syndrome is typically associated with rapid conduction over the AV node as well as the Accessory Pathway. AV nodal blockers slow down conduction and decrease the number of impulses entering the ventricles anterogradely through the AV node (but may increase the rate of conduction through the accessory pathway). This will reduce the number of impulses bombarding the ventricular end of the bypass tract or accessory pathway rendering the bypass tract less refractory. This may paradoxically increase the rate of conduction through the accessory pathway placing the patient at risk for development of VF. 'Digoxin appears to shoen the refractory period of the Accessory pathway directly and thus increases the ventricular rate' - Harrison 'Verapamil appears to shoen the refractory period of the accessory pathway indirectly by causing vasodilatation and a reflex increase in sympathetic tone' - Harrison",A

Socialism 

It is a system of production and distribution based on social ownership for raising the living standard of working class.
In other words, socialism is a system of social organization that advocates the vesting of the ownership and control of means of production and distribution, of capital, land, etc. in the community as whole.
In contrast to socialism, Capitalism is an economic and social system in which most trade and industry are privately controlled for profit rather than by the state. The means of production (i.e., capital) are owned, operated and traded for the purpose of generating profits by private individuals, either singly or jointly.

Not a feature of hereditary Spherocytosis: March 2007,Autosomal dominant,Increased RBC surface area,Increased MCHC,Normal or decreased MCV,"Ans. B: Increased RBC surface area It's the only condition presenting with Increased MCHC Spherocytosis is caused by a molecular defect in one or more of the proteins of the red blood cell cytoskeleton, including, spectrin, ankyrin so blood cell contracts to its most surface-tension efficient and least flexible configuration, a sphere( spherocytes). They have a high osmotic fragility and are more prone to physical degradation. They are most commonly found in immunologically-mediated hemolytic anemias and in hereditary spherocytosis, but the former would have a positive direct Coombs test and the latter would not. The misshapen but otherwise healthy red blood cells are mistaken by the spleen for old or damaged red blood cells and it thus constantly breaks them down, causing a cycle whereby the body destroys its own blood supply (auto-hemolysis). Chronic symptoms include anemia and splenomegaly. As a result of the broken-down blood cells -- bilirubin -- accumulates in the gallbladder and can cause pigmented gallstones to develop. In peripheral blood smears, red blood cells will appear abnormally small. The CBC will show elevated MCHC. The bone marrow in its role of manufacturing red blood cells will display hyperplasia, the increased activity of replacing RBCs. As a result, immature red blood cell or reticulocyte counts will appear elevated.",B

More false positive cases in a community signify that the disease has:,High prevalence,High sensitivity,Low prevalence,Low sensitivity,"There will be more false positive cases in a community where prevalence is low, because the predictive accuracy of the test is decreased. This predictive value however depends on the prevalence of a disease (besides its sensitivity and specificity). The more prevalent a disease in a given population, the more is the predictive value of a given test. Thus, the more prevalent a disease, the more will be the True positive and the less will be the false positive. The less prevalent a disease, the less will be the True positive and the more will be the false positive. Thus there will be more false positive cases in a community where prevalence is less because, the predictive accuracy of the test is decreased. Low prevalence is the best answer.

Which of the following is not an accepted method of randomization-,Computer drawn randomization,Odd/even day hospital admission,Lottery,Random number table,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Odd/even day hospital admission Methods of Randomization o Randomization is accomplished in a number of classic ways 1. Lottery method Suppose 10 patients are to be put in a control group or the trial group out of 100 available. The serial numbers of patients are noted on 100 cards and then shuffled well. The cards are drawn one by one and thus patients are allocated into trial and control groups. 2. Table of Random Numbers Published tables of Random numbers are used. This is considered to be the best method of randomization. A computer program is used for randomization o Randomization methods , which may at first seem reasonable (odd-even day randomization or daytime-nighttime convenience randomization), may actually suppo bias, paicularly if the study is open-label or the operator or subject are not blinded as to the nature of the intervention. For example, if the study involves a procedure such as wound irrigation and the patients are randomized to have wounds irrigated with sterile saline on even days and tap water on odd days, a patient may present on an even day and the treating clinical investigator may elect not to enroll the patient in the study or to break the randomization, because they 'just think that this paicular wound needs saline irrigation.' This is a very common error in otherwise well-designed clinical studies.",B
Vegetable fat differs from animal oil in being –,More saturated,More stable,More atherosclerotic,Contains less fat soluble vitamin,"Vegetable fats are more unsaturated than animal fats, PUFA is found mostly in vegetable fats.

However, there are exceptions, as for example coconut and palm oils although vegetable oils, have an extremely high percentage of saturated fatty acids. On the other hand , fish oil contain good percentage of PUFA

Vegetable fats are less stable.

They contain high no. of unsaturated bonds which undergo spontaneous oxidation at the double bond forming aldehydes,ketones and resins.

Vegetable fats are less atherosclerotic;

In fact PUFA have a favorable effect on serum lipid profile. They decrease LDL and increase HDL ( good cholesterol ).Essential fatty acids ( high percentage in vegetable fat) decrease the platelet adhesiveness.

Vegetable fat contains less fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E & K vitamin).

He is likely to be having-,Atrial septal defect,Large ventricular septal defect,Small ventricular septal defect,Eisenmenger's syndrome,"ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a defect in the ventricular septum, the wall dividing the left and right ventricles of the hea. The extent of the opening may vary from pin size to complete absence of the ventricular septum, creating one common ventricle. The ventricular septum consists of an inferior muscular and superior membranous poion and is extensively innervated with conducting cardiomyocytes signs and symptoms Ventricular septal defect is usually symptomless at bih. It usually manifests a few weeks after bih. VSD is an acyanotic congenital hea defect, aka a left-to-right shunt, so there are no signs of cyanosis in the early stage. However, uncorrected VSD can increase pulmonary resistance leading to the reversal of the shunt and corresponding cyanosis. Pansystolic (Holosystolic) murmur along lower left sternal border (depending upon the size of the defect) +/- palpable thrill (palpable turbulence of blood flow). Hea sounds are normal. Larger VSDs may cause a parasternal heave, a displaced apex beat (the palpable heabeat moves laterally over time, as the hea enlarges). An infant with a large VSD will fail to thrive and become sweaty and tachypnoeic (breathe faster) with feeds. The restrictive ventricular septal defects (smaller defects) are associated with a louder murmur and more palpable thrill (grade IV murmur). Larger defects may eventually be associated with pulmonary hypeension due to the increased blood flow. Over time this may lead to an Eisenmenger's syndrome the original VSD operating with a left-to-right shunt, now becomes a right-to-left shunt because of the increased pressures in the pulmonary vascular bed ref Harrison20th edition pg 1299",B

It presents as an acute systemic disorder, usually affecting children under 5 years.Kawasaki's disease is an acute, febrile, multisystem disease of children. Some 80% of cases occur prior to the age of 5, with the peak incidence occurring at <=2 years. It is characterized by nonsuppurative cervical adenitis and changes in the skin and mucous membranes such as edema; congested conjunctivae; erythema of the oral cavity, lips, and palms; and desquamation of the skin of the fingeips. Although the disease is generally benign and self-limited, it is associated with coronary aery aneurysms in ~25% of cases, with an overall case fatality rate of 0.5-2.8%.Presentation is with fever, generalised rash, including palms and soles, inflamed oral mucosa and conjunctival congestion resembling a viral exanthema. The cause is unknown but it is thought to be an abnormal immune response to an infectious trigger These complications usually occur between the third and fouh weeks of illness during the convalescent stage. Vasculitis of the coronary aeries is seen in almost all the fatal cases that have been autopsied. There is typical intimal proliferation and infiltration of the vessel wall with mononuclear cells. Beadlike aneurysms and thromboses may be seenalong the aery. Other manifestations include pericarditis, myocarditis,myocardial ischemia and infarction, and cardiomegaly . It occurs mainly in Japan and other Asian countries, such as China and Korea, but other ethnic groups may also be affected.

The average age at onset is 70, with a female-to-male ratio of about 3 : 1. The overall prevalence is about 20 per 100 000 in those over the age of 50 years. Clinical features The cardinal symptom of GCA is headache, which is often localised to the temporal or occipital region and may be accompanied by scalp tenderness. Jaw pain develops in some patients, brought on by chewing or talking. Visual disturbance can occur (most specifically amaurosis) and a catastrophic presentation is with blindness in one eye due to occlusion of the posterior ciliary aery. On fundoscopy, the optic disc may appear pale and swollen with haemorrhages, but these changes may take 24-36 hours to develop and the fundi may initially appear normal. Rarely, neurological involvement may occur, with transient ischaemic attacks, brainstem infarcts and hemiparesis. In GCA, constitutional symptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue, malaise and night sweats, are common. With PMR, there may be stiffness and painful restriction of active shoulder movements on waking.

MENKES disease due to defective absorption of:,Zinc,Manganese,Copper,Selenium,"Ans: C (Copper) Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 17th edition. 2008. Chapter 71. PgA49Explanation:Dietary copper deficiency is relatively rare, although it has been described in premature infants wdio are fed milk diets and in infants with malabsorption.Copper-deficiency anemia has been reported in patients with malabsorptive diseases and nephrotic syndrome and in patients treated for Wilson's disease with chronic high doses of oral zinc, which can interfere with copper absorption.Menkes' kinky hair syndrome is an X-linked metabolic disturbance of copper metabolism characterized by mental retardation, hypo- cupremia and decreased circulating ceruloplasmin.It is caused by mutations in the copper-transporting ATP7A gene.Children with this disease often die within 5 years because of dissecting aneurysms or cardiac rupture.Aceruloplasminemia is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by tissue iron overload, mental deterioration, microcytic anemia, and low serum iron and copper concentrations.The diagnosis of copper deficiency is usually made on the basis of low serum levels of copper (<65 microg/dL) and low ceruloplasmin levels (<20 mg/dL).Serum levels of copper may be elevated in pregnancy or stress conditions since ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant and 90% of circulating copper is bound to ceruloplasmin.",C
True about acute tubular necrosis: (PGI June 2007),Urine specific gravity > 1020,Urine osmolality > 300 mosmoles/kg,Urine Na < 10 meq/L,Blood urea: creatinine ratio < 20,"Ans,: D (Bloodurea: Creatinine ratio < 20) [Ref: Harrison 17th/1758,16th/1649}Renal Failure Indices Harrison I7th/i758,16th/1649Analysis of urine and blood biochemistry may be useful for distinguishing prerenal ARF from ischemic or nephrotoxic intrinsic renal ARF.# The/racfj'ona/ excretion of sodium (FE) is most useful in this regard-. The FENa relates sodium clearance to creatinine clearance. Sodium is reabsorbed avidly from glomerular filtrate in patients with prerenal ARF, in an attempt to restore intravascular volume. The FENa tends to be high in ischemic ATN but is often low in patients with sepsis-induced, pigment-induced, and some forms of nephrotoxic ATN (e.g., contrast-associated) 1In contrast, creatinine is not reabsorbed in either setting. Consequently, patients with prerenal ARF typically have a FEof <1.0% (frequently <0.1%). In patients with metabolic alkalosis, where there may be obligate losses of sodium in the urine to maintain electroneutrality, the fractional excretion of chloride [FECI) may be more sensitive than the FESj in detecting prerenal azotemia.The urine sodium concentration'lls a less-sensitive index for distinguishing prerenal ARF from ischemicand nephrotoxic ARF as values overlap between groups. Similarly, indices of urinary concentrating ability such as urine specific gravity, urine osmolality, urine-to-plasma urea ratio, and blood urea-to-creatinine ratio are of limited value in differential diagnosis.Many caveats apply when interpreting biochemical renal failure indices. The FEVi may be >1.0% in prerenal ARF if patients are receiving diuretics or with preexisting chronic kidney disease, certain salt-wasting syndromes, or adrenal insufficiency.Urine Diagnostic Indices in Differentiation of Prerenal versus Intrinsic Renal ARF (Harrison 16th/1649, not given in H17th)Diagnostic IndexPrerenalIntrinsic Renal (i.,e., ATN)Fraction excretion of sodium<1>1Urine sodium concentration(mmol/L)<10>20Urine creatinine to plasma creatinine ratio Q>40 Q<20 QUrine urea nitrogen to plasma urea nitrogen ratio>8<3Urine specific gravity>1.020-1.010Urine osmolality (mosmol/kgH2O)>500-300Plasma BUN/creatine ratio>20<10-15Renal failure index<1>1Urinary sedimentHyaline castsMuddy brown granular casts",D

'v' Wave in JVP is due to ?,Right atrial contraction,Left atrial contraction,Right atrial relaxation,Closure of tricuspid valve,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Closure of tricuspid valve. The jugular venous pressure (JVP, sometimes referred to as jugular venous pulse) is the indirectly observed pressure over the venous system visualization of the internal jugular vein. The jugular venous pulsation has a biphasic waveform.The ' a ' wave corresponds to right Atrial contraction and ends synchronously with the carotid aery pulse. The peak of the 'a' wave demarcates the end of atrial systole.The ' c ' wave corresponds to right ventricular Contraction causing the triCuspid valve to bulge towards the right atrium.The ' x' ' (x prime) descent follows the 'c' wave and occurs as a result of the right ventricle pulling the tricuspid valve downward during ventricular systole. (As stroke volume is ejected, the ventricle takes up less space in pericardium, allowing relaXed atrium to enlarge). The x' (x prime) descent can be used as a measure of right ventricle contractility.The ' x ' descent follows the 'a' wave and corresponds to atrial relaXation and rapid atrial filling due to low pressure.The ' v ' wave corresponds to Venous filling when the tricuspid valve is closed and venous pressure increases from venous return - this occurs during and following the carotid pulse.The ' y ' descent corresponds to the rapid emptYing of the atrium into the ventricle following the opening of the tricuspid valve.",D

Onset of the disease stas during the first year of life especially after 6 months of age, when hemoglobin F levels falls, as a signal is sent to switch from production of gamma globin to beta globin. Hemoglobin S is unstable and polymerizes during hypoxemia and acidosis, leading to sickling of red blood cells. Patients develops jaundice, pigmented gallstones, spleenomegaly, and poorly healing ulcers over the lower tibia. Acute painful episodes can occur due to acute vaso-occlusion by clusters of sickled red cells during infection, dehydration, or hypoxia. Common sites of acute painful episodes include the bones and the chest.

Egg contains all vitamins except,B1,B6,C,E,"Egg Egg contains all the nutrients except carbohydrate and vitamin C. About 12 per cent of egg is made of shell, 58 per cent of egg white, and 30 per cent of egg yolk. An egg weighing 60 grams contains 6 g of protein, 6 g of fat, 30 mg of calcium and 1.5 mg of iron, and supplies about 70 kcal of energy. Egg proteins have all the nine essential amino acids needed by the body in right propoions. Nutritionists consider egg protein as the best among food proteins. In fact, egg protein is the standard against which the quality of other proteins is compared. Except for vitamin C, egg contains all the fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins in appreciable amounts. Impoant minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc and other trace elements are present in the egg. Barring milk, no other food can supply such a diverse range of nutrients. Net protein utilization (NPU) which combines in a single value the biological value and digestibility, is 100 for egg compared to 80 for meat and 75 for milk. Raw egg white is not assimilated by the intestinal mucosa, therefore it must be cooked before consumption. Boiling destroys 'avidin', a substance which prevents the body from obtaining biotin, one of the B-complex vitamins. Boiled egg is therefore nutritionally superior to raw egg. In recent years the cholesterol content of egg (250 mg/egg) has generated a sense of fear because of the risk of CHD . A reduction in intake of eggs is advised for those at risk of CHD. This should not distract others from eating eggs. Eggs or no eggs, cholesterol is formed in the body endogenously and is controlled by what is known as feedback mechanism.

A 29 year old anxious lady presents with a history of progressive breathlessness and exercise intolerance since four months. Her FVC is 90% and FEV I / FVC is 86%. Oxygen saturation after exercise was observed to drop from 92% to 86%. What is the likely diagnosis :,Primary alveolar hypoventilation,Primary pulmonary hypeension,Anxiety disorder,Interstitial lung disease,"Answer is B (Primary pulmonary hypeension): Reduced exercise tolerance and drop in oxygen saturation from 92% to 86% on exercise with a normal FVC and FEVI/FVC is consistent with a diagnosis of Primary Pulmonary Hypeension. Primary Pulmonary Hypeension characteristically presents with exeional dyspnea, exercise intolerance and a normal FVC; FEVI /FVC ratio The most common symptom attributable to pulmonary hypeension is exeional dyspnea and reduced exercise capacity -- Harrison Primary pulmonary hypeension is neither a restrictive nor obstructive pulmonary disease, and hence spirometry results are essentially normal with both FVC and FEVI / FVC ratio > 80% of predicted. Obstructive disease Restrictive disease FEV 1 / FVC is characteristically < 80% of predicted FVC is characteristically < 80% of predicted Interstitial lung disease does not present with a normal FVC Interstitial lung disease should present with a restrictive pattern on 'pulmonary function tests' with a reduced FVC to values less than 80% of predicted. A forced vital capacity of 90% (FVC = 90%) is normal and hence makes a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease unlikely Primary Alveolar Hvpoventilation does not present with dyspnea and exercise intolerance Patients with primary pulmonary hypoventilation may have normal pulmonary function test with a normal FEV1 and normal FVC/FEV 1. However, dyspnea or shoness of breath is remarkably absent or extremely uncommon despite severe aerial blood gas derangements presumably because of impaired chemoreceptor and ventilatory drive. Also exacerbation of hypoxemia or drop in oxygen saturation is characteristically seen during sleep and not on exercise. `Despite severe aerial blood gas derangements is uncommon' - Harrison `Dyspnea is remarkably absent' - Spiral Manual of pulmonary Medicine (Lippincott) 6th/444 Anxiety disorder: Hyperventilation does not present with exercise intolerance Patients with Anxiety associated Hyperventilation may also present with normal spirometry results with a normal FVC and FEV 1 /FVC.

It is usually given every 12-24 hours.Less frequent dosing may result in less tachyphylaxis, which occurs when synthesis cannot compensate for the released stores.The major side effect of DDAVP is hyponatremia due to decreased free water clearance.Some patients with types 2A and 2M VWD respond to DDAVP such that it can be used for minor procedures,For the other subtypes, for type 3 disease, and for major procedures requiring longer periods of normal hemostasis, VWF replacement can be given.Virally inactivated VWF-containing factor concentrates are thought to be safer than cryoprecipitate as the replacement product.Antifibrinolytic therapyo Aminocaproic acid or Tranexamic acid.o It is an important therapy, either alone or in an adjunctive capacity, particularly for the prevention or treatment of mucosal bleeding.o These agents are particularly useful in prophylaxis for dental procedures, with DDAVP for dental extractions and tonsillectomy, menorrhagia and prostate procedures,o It is contraindicated in the setting of upper urinary tract bleeding, due to the risk of ureteral obstruction.",A

Highest amount of Vitamin D is present in,Sunlight,Shark liver oil,Cod liver oil,Halibut fish liver oil,"Sources of Vitamin D Vitamin D is unique because it is derived both from sunlight and foods (a) Sunlight : Vitamin Dis synthesized by the body by the action of UV rays of sunlight on 7-dehydrocholesterol, which is stored in large abundance in the skin. Exposure to UV rays is critical; these can be filtered off by air pollution. Dark-skinned races such as Negros, also suffer from this disadvantage because black skin can filter off up to 95 per cent of UV rays. (b) Foods : Vitamin D occurs only in foods of animal origin. Liver, egg yolk, butter and cheese, and some species of fish contain useful amounts. Fish liver oils, although not considered to be a food, are the richest source of vitamin D. Human milk has been shown to contain considerable amounts of water-soluble vitamin D sulphate. Other sources of vitamin D are foods aificially foified with vitamin D, such as milk, margarine, vanaspati and infant foods.

It mainly affects the aoa (the main blood vessel leaving the hea) and its branches, as well as the pulmonary aeries. Females are about 8-9 times more likely to be affected than males. Those with the disease often notice symptoms between 15 and 30 years of age. In the Western world, atherosclerosis is a more frequent cause of obstruction of the aoic arch vessels than Takayasu's aeritis. Takayasu's aeritis is similar to other forms of vasculitis, including giant cell aeritis which typically affects older individuals. Due to obstruction of the main branches of the aoa, including the left common carotid aery, the brachiocephalic aery, and the left subclan aery, Takayasu's aeritis can present as pulseless upper extremities (arms, hands, and wrists with weak or absent pulses on the physical examination) which may be why it is also commonly referred to as the 'pulseless disease.'

A pharma agent wants to introduce vaccine for 1 yr old and see its efficacy. The study design should be ?,Coho study,Clinical trial,Field trial,None.,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Field trial Experimental epidemiology (Epidemiological Experiments) Experimental epidemiology is also called trial. Broadly speaking, a trial refers to putting something to a test. This allows the term to be used in reference to a test of a treatment for the sick or a test of a preventive measure intended to ave illness, injury or disease. Therefore, the defining feature of an experimental study is its ability to allocate or assign interventions or treatment to experiment unit. In simple words, the study of a treatment (Drugs, surgical intervention) or preventive measure (e.g. vaccination) on living subjects is known as experimental study or trial. Assignment of treatments may be based on Randamization - In randomized controlled trials Non-randmization trails There are following types of experimental trials Clinical trials: Used to evaluate treatment for people who are ill (e.g. a clinical trial of a chemotherapeutic agent) Field trails: Used to evaluate interventions to prevent disease in healthy people (e.g. a field trial of a vaccine). Community trial: Used to evaluate community-wide intervention (e.g. a community trail of the effects of fluoridation of public water supply). Animal Study: When clincial trails are done on animals (instead of human) is called animal study. In an experimental study, the investigator assign individuals in experimental group and reference group and then follows the two groups for the outcome of interests. Therefore, experimental study is prospective study. Before staing any experimental study the approval of ethics committee is required. The poocol of study is submitted to ethics committee and ethics committee gives approval to the studies which are ethical. So, all experimental studies are considered ethical (after taking approval of ethics committee). There are fewer ethical restrains on experimental study in animals than in human.",C
Zinc is not required for: March 2011,Embryonic development,Coagulation pathway,DNA synthesis,Spermatogenesis,"Ans. B: Coagulation Pathway Severe maternal zinc deficiency has been associated with congenital malformations or spontaneous aboions Zinc deficiency has been repoed to result in sexual infantilism (zinc is required for proper reproduction) Zinc is required for wound healing. Zinc enhances cell growth and division. Zinc Zinc is found in nearly 100 specific enzymes, serves as structural ions in transcription factors and is stored and transferred in metallothioneins. It is 'typically the second most abundant transition metal in organisms' after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. In proteins, Zn ions are often coordinated to the amino acid side chains of aspaic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine and histidine. There are 2-4 grams of zinc distributed throughout the human body. Most zinc is in the brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations in the prostate and pas of the eye. Semen is paicularly rich in zinc, which is a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth. In humans, zinc plays 'ubiquitous biological roles'. It interacts with 'a wide range of organic ligands', and has roles in the metabolism of RNA and DNA, signal transduction, and gene expression. It also regulates apoptosis. In the brain, zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons and can 'modulate brain excitability'. It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning. However it has been called 'the brain's dark horse' since it also can be a neurotoxin, suggesting zinc homeostasis plays a critical role in normal functioning of the brain and central nervous system. Zinc is an efficient Lewis acid, making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions. The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions. Two examples of zinc-containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase, which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.",B

IPC 82 states that: child cannot be punished under what age -,5yrs,8yrs,7yrs,lOyrs,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 7yrs o Section 82 I.P.C.: Criminal responsibility is any act which is done by a child under seven years of age is not an offence.Section of IPCRelated with82A child under the age of seven is incapable of committing an offence. This is so because action alobe does not amount to guilt unless if is accompanied by a guilty mind. And, a child of that tender age cannot have a guilty mind or criminal intention with which the act is done. This presumption, however, is only confined to offenses under the IPC but not to other Acts, e.g., the Railway Act.83A child above seven and under twelve years of age is presumed to be capable of committing an offence it he has obtained sufficient maturity to understand and judge the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. The law presumes such maturity' in a child of that age unless the contrary is proved by the defence.89A child under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent to suffer any harm which can occur from an act done in good faith and for its benefit, e.g., a consent for an operation. Only, a guardian can give such consent.87A person under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent, whether express or implied, to suffer any harm which may result from an act no intended or not known to cause death or grievous hurt e.g. consent for a wrestling contest.84Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is uncapable of knowing the nature of act (i.e. it is wrong or contrary to law).85,86Drunkness and criminal responsibilityQ",C

"An 80-year-old woman is admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis due to a urinary tract infection. While in the ICU she develops atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is treated with a loading dose of amiodarone. She converts to sinus rhythm and is sent home on amiodarone to prevent recurrences of atrial fibrillation. In the following weeks she develops increasing fatigue, dry skin, and constipation and her internist finds her TSH to be 25. She is in sinus rhythm. What is the best approach in this situation?",Stop the amiodarone and follow the TSH and the clinical response.,Start low dose levothyroxine and repeat TSH in 6 weeks.,Start a beta-blocker and begin weaning off the amiodarone.,Check for anti-TPO antibodies to help guide your decision.,"Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrhythmic drug. It is related structurally to thyroid hormone and is stored in adipose tissue. The drug has a high iodine content as well. Taking amiodarone on an ongoing basis can lead to hypothyroidism by inhibiting deiodinase activity and by acting as a direct antagonist to T4 . In some cases, amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism resolves within a few months; however, in many, especially when accompanying anti-TPO antibodies are present, treatment with levothyroxine is needed. This can be easily monitored and adjusted. While answer a is a consideration, the patient likely needs the amiodarone given her tendency toward paroxysms of atrial fibrillation and the attendant risk of stroke. While starting a beta-blocker may prevent episodes of rapid ventricular response, this decision would be made with the help of her cardiologist, which is not mentioned. Anti-TPO antibodies increase the risk of hypothyroidism but are not necessary to guide therapy in this patient. Although prednisone may be used for treatment of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism, this patient has hypothyroidism, and prednisone is not indicated.",B

Which of these does not cause crescentric glomerulonephrits -,Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,Alpo syndrome,Goodpasture syndrome,Henoch schonlein purpura,"Alpo's syndrome A number of uncommon diseases may involve the glomerulus in childhood but the most impoant one affecting adults is Alpo's syndrome. Most cases arise from a mutation or deletion of the COL4A5 gene on the X chromosome, which encodes type IV collagen, resulting in inheritance as an X-linked recessive disorder . Mutations in COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes are less common and cause autosomal recessive disease. The accumulation of abnormal collagen results in a progressive degeneration of the GBM . Affected patients progress from haematuria to ESRD in their late teens or twenties. Female carriers of COL4A5 mutations usually have haematuria but less commonly develop significant renal disease. Some other basement membranes containing the same collagen isoforms are similarly involved notably in the cochlea, so that Alpo's syndrome is associated with sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities. Angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may slow but not prevent loss of kidney function. Patients with Alpo's syndrome are good candidates for renal replacement therapy (R), as they are young and usually otherwise healthy. They can develop an immune response to the normal collagen antigens present in the GBM of the donor kidney and, in a small minority, anti-GBM disease develops and destroys the allograft Ref Harrison20th edition pg 297",B
G6PD -,Oxidizes NADPH,Reduces NADP,Oxidizes NAD,Reduces NAD,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Reduces NADP Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency* Abnormalities in the hexose monophosphate shunt or glutathione metabolism resulting from deficient or impaired enzyme function reduce the ability of red cells to protect themselves against oxidative injuries and lead to hemolysis.* The most important of these enzyme derangements is the hereditary deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity.* G6PD reduces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) to NADPH while oxidizing glucose- 6-phosphate.* NADPH then provides reducing equivalents needed for conversion of oxidized glutathione to reduced glutathione, which protects against oxidant injury by participating as a cofactor in reactions that neutralize compounds such as H2O2.Role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in defense against oxidant injury. The disposal of H202, a potential oxidant, is dependent on the adequacy of reduced glutathione (GSH), which is generated by the action of the reduced from of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH).

All are true about hyperophic obstructive cardiomyopathyexcept-,Assymetrical septal hyperophy,Systolic ventricular dysfunction is absent,Anterior leaflet movement is delayed,Cardiac output is diminished,"Obstructive or non-obstructive Depending on whether the distoion of normal hea anatomy causes an obstruction of the outflow of blood from the left ventricle of the hea, HCM can be classified as obstructive or non-obstructive. The obstructive variant of HCM, hyperophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), has also historically been known as idiopathic hyperophic subaoic stenosis (IHSS) and asymmetric septal hyperophy (ASH). Another, non-obstructive variant of HCM is apical hyperophic cardiomyopathy, also called Yamaguchi Syndrome or Yamaguchi Hyperophy, first described in individuals of Japanese descent. Hyperophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which a poion of the hea becomes thickened without an obvious cause.This results in the hea being less able to pump blood effectively. Symptoms vary from none to feeling tired, leg swelling, and shoness of breath. It may also result in chest pain or fainting.Complications include hea failure, an irregular heabeat, and sudden cardiac death. It is often due to mutations in ceain genes involved with making hea muscle proteins. Other causes may include Fabry disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and ceain medications such as tacrolimus.It is a type of cardiomyopathy, a group of diseases that primarily affects the hea muscle. Diagnosis often involves an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and stress testing. Genetic testing may also be done Upon cardiac catheterization, catheters can be placed in the left ventricle and the ascending aoa, to measure the pressure difference between these structures. In normal individuals, during ventricular systole, the pressure in the ascending aoa and the left ventricle will equalize, and the aoic valve is open. In individuals with aoic stenosis or with HCM with an outflow tract gradient, there will be a pressure gradient (difference) between the left ventricle and the aoa, with the left ventricular pressure higher than the aoic pressure. This gradient represents the degree of obstruction that has to be overcome in order to eject blood from the left ventricle. The Brockenbrough-Braunwald-Morrow sign is observed in individuals with HCM with outflow tract gradient. This sign can be used to differentiate HCM from aoic stenosis. In individuals with aoic stenosis, after a premature ventricular contraction (PVC), the following ventricular contraction will be more forceful, and the pressure generated in the left ventricle will be higher. Because of the fixed obstruction that the stenotic aoic valve represents, the post-PVC ascending aoic pressure will increase as well. In individuals with HCM, however, the degree of obstruction will increase more than the force of contraction will increase in the post-PVC beat. The result of this is that the left ventricular pressure increases and the ascending aoic pressure decreases, with an increase in the LVOT gradient. While the Brockenbrough-Braunwald-Morrow sign is most dramatically demonstrated using simultaneous intra-cardiac and intra-aoic catheters, it can be seen on routine physical examination as a decrease in the pulse pressure in the post-PVC beat in individuals with HCM Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 456",C

What is the most likely precursor to bronchiectasis?,Tuberculosis,Carcinoma,Bronchial adenoma,Necrotising pneumonia,"Bronchiectasis may be the sequela of a variety of necrotising infections that are either inadequately treated or not treated at all. Primary infection is a paicularly common cause of bronchiectasis. The most widely cited mechanism of infectious bronchiectasis is the 'vicious cycle hypothesis,' in which susceptibility to infection and poor mucociliary clearance result in microbial colonization of the bronchial tree. Some organisms, such asPseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibit a paicular propensity for colonizing damaged airways and evading host defense mechanisms. Impaired mucociliary clearance can result from inherited conditions such as CF or dyskinetic cilia syndrome, and it has been proposed that a single severe infection (e.g., pneumonia caused byBordetella peussisorMycoplasma pneumoniae) can result in significant airway damage and poor secretion clearance. The presence of the microbes incites continued chronic inflammation, with consequent damage to the airway wall, continued impairment of secretions and microbial clearance, and ongoing propagation of the infectious/inflammatory cycle. Moreover, it has been proposed that mediators released directly from bacteria can interfere with mucociliary clearance.",D

All are true in chronic constrictive pericarditis except-,Kussamauls sign in present,Ascites is not in propoion to edema,Commonest cause is idiopathic,Right ventricular and diastolic pressure is raised,"Constrictive pericarditis is a medical condition characterized by a thickened, fibrotic pericardium, limiting the hea's ability to function normally.In many cases, the condition continues to be difficult to diagnose and therefore benefits from a good understanding of the underlying cause The pathophysiological characteristics of constrictive pericarditis are due to a thickened, fibrotic pericardium that forms a non-compliant shell around the hea. This shell prevents the hea from expanding when blood enters it. This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the hea. During inspiration, pressure in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the left atrium, subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs. During expiration, the amount of blood entering the right ventricle will decrease, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, and increased filling of the [[left ventricle and subsequent increased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole.This is known as ventricular interdependence, since the amount of blood flow into one ventricle is dependent on the amount of blood flow into the other ventricle. Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: fatigue, swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a hea attack Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1436",C

Induction chemotherapy is initiated early in treatment after attempts at leukocytoreduction but not immediately. Immediate induction chemotherapy is the single best answer of exclusion. Immediate Administration of induction chemotherapy to a patient with hyperleukocytosis carries a high risk of Acute tumor lysis syndrome and hence induction chemotherapy is often not initiated immediately but generally follows attempts at cytoreduction.

Association of Two variables explained by 3rd variable is ?,Spurious association,Indirect association,Direct association,Causal association,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Indirect association Association Descriptive studies help to suggest an aetiological hypothesis. Analytic and experimental studies test the hypothesis, derived from descriptive studies and confirm or refute the observed association between suspected causes and disease. Association may be defined as the concurrence of two variables more often than would be expected by chance. In other words, events are said to be associated when they occur more frequently togeher than one would expect by chance. Association can be of following types : - 1 .Spurious association Observed association between a disease and suspected factor is spurious, i.e., not real. In other words there is an observed association when none actually exists. 2.Indirect association The indirect association is a statistical association between a variable of interest and a disease due to the presence of another factor, known or unknown, that is common to both the variable and the disease. This third factor (i.e., the common factor) is also known as the confounding variable. For example, endemic goitre (disease) is found at high altitudes (variable), showing thereby an association between altitude and endemic goitre. But it is due to iodine deficiency which is common at high altitude. So, iodine deficiency acts as a confounding factor as it is associated with both high altitude and endemic goitre. 3.Direct (causal) association a) One to one causal relationship Two variables are stated to be causally related if change in one is followed by change in other. If It does not, then their relationship cannot be causal. b) Multifactorial causation The causal thinking is different in non-communicable disease (e.g., CHD) where the etiology is multifactorial, i.e., more than one factors are associated with disease causation.",B

"Features seen in hemolytic anemia are all, EXCEPT:",Tear drop and Burr cells,Reduced Haptoglobin,Reticulocytosis,Hemoglobinuria,"The laboratory features of Hemolytic anemia are related to hemolysis per se and the erythropoietic response of the bone marrow. Hemolysis regularly produces in the serum an increase in unconjugated bilirubin and aspaate transaminase (AST); urobilinogen will be increased in both urine and stool. If hemolysis is mainly intravascular, the telltale sign is hemoglobinuria (often associated with hemosiderinuria); in the serum there is increased hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is increased, and haptoglobin is reduced. In contrast, the bilirubin level may be normal or only mildly elevated. The main sign of the erythropoietic response by the bone marrow is an increase in reticulocytes. Burr cells are seen in uremia.Tear drop cells are seen in myelofibrosis. Ref: Luzzatto L. (2012). Chapter 106. Hemolytic Anemias and Anemia Due to Acute Blood Loss. In D.L. Longo, A.S. Fauci, D.L.

Following are features of complete hea block EXCEPT-,Bradycardia,Cannon waves,Varying intensity of 1st hea sound,Hea rate increase during exercise,"Third-degree atrioventricular block (AV block), is a medical condition in which the nerve impulse generated in the sinoatrial node (SA node) in the atrium of the hea can not propagate to the ventricles Because the impulse is blocked, an accessory pacemaker in the lower chambers will typically activate the ventricles. This is known as an escape rhythm. Since this accessory pacemaker also activates independently of the impulse generated at the SA node, two independent rhythms can be noted on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The P waves with a regular P-to-P interval (in other words, a sinus rhythm) represent the first rhythm. The QRS complexes with a regular R-to-R interval represent the second rhythm. The PR interval will be variable, as the hallmark of complete hea block is lack of any apparent relationship between P waves and QRS complexes . Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1532",D
Best predictor for coronary artery disease,HDL,LDL,VLDL,Chylomicron,"Elevated LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol are independent predictors of coronary heart disease.
Although there is consensus regarding the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol the value of elevating HDL
cholesterol remains controversial.
Low HDL and coronary risk
High serum HDL cholesterol is associated with a lower risk of CHD.
The incidence of CHD events in a normal population appears to be inversely related to serum HDL cholesterol with
low levels being associated with increased coronary risk.
Based upon data from the Framingham Heart study, the risk for myocardial infarction increases by about 2 5% for
every 5mg/dl (.13 mmol/l) decrement in serum HDL cholesterol.
Elevated LDL and coronary risk
Elevation in LDL cholesterol is a well-known risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease.
Association of elevated LDL with coronary artery disease has been established in various trials and studies.
There is linear reduction in cardiovascular disease with progressive lowering of the LDL cholesterol.
Traditionally LDL levels are considered to be the most important factor in the prediction of coronary artery disease.
The importance of LDL as a risk factor lies in the fact that effective therapies are available to lower it, while it is not
so in the case of HDL. So when treating dyslipidemia for reducing cardiovascular events, the first target is LDL and
not HDL.
Doubt and Controversy
What is creating doubts in our mind is a table from Braunwald 8th/e p1008 according to which ‘Low HDL’ appears to
be better marker for prediction of future cardiovascular disease than ‘High LDL’
According to this bar diagram in Braunnwald 8th/e pl008 - the adjusted hazard ratio for future cardiovascular events
for LDL is 1.62 while that of HDL is 2.32. But the text given in the book does clarify which one is better marker, (we
have given this table from Braunwald in our previous discussion on this topic in Nov 2009 Medicine).
We have tried to confirm this ‘Low HDL’ fact from various other books. But none of the texts clearly favored any one
between these 2 to be the better marker. Both LDL and HDL are mentioned to be important.
We have also consulted several cardiologist on this. All of them say that the answer should be LDL.
Well, Braunwald is text book of immense reputation, and any information or text given in the book does not need
confirmation from any other source. But what has added to the confusion is that the latest edition of Braunwald i.e.,
9th/e has eliminated that diagram from the book and in the text have not clarified which one is better marker.
Instead, the text states that Apolipo (a) and B 100 are better marker for predicting future cardiovascular events than
LDL and HDL.
We are not absolutely sure of the answer, but we would for the time being go with LDL.

"In hemolytic anemia, all of the following are true except: March 2005",Bone marrow hyperplasia,Reticulocytosis,Increased unconjugated bilirubin,Increased haptoglobulin,"Ans. D: Increased haptoglobulin Hemolysis presents as acute or chronic anemia, reticulocytosis, or jaundice. The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. In most of the cases, a bone marrow aspirate is not necessary in the diagnostic workup; if it is done, it shows erythroid hyperplasia. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis.",D

"A patient presents with haemoptysis, copious sputum and tram lines (abnormal air bronchogram) pattern on the chest X ray. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Lung abscess,Pulmonary embolism with infarction,Bronchiectasis,Carcinoma of lung,"Bronchiectasis:
The most common clinical presentation is a persistent productive cough with ongoing production of thick, tenacious sputum. Physical findings often include crackles and wheezing on lung auscultation, and some patients with bronchiectasis exhibit clubbing of the digits. Mild to moderate airflow obstruction is often detected on pulmonary function tests, overlapping with that seen at presentation with other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
The diagnosis is usually based on presentation with a persistent chronic cough and sputum production accompanied by consistent radiographic features. Although chest radiographs lack sensitivity, the presence of “tram tracks” indicating dilated airways is consistent with bronchiectasis.

"Human milk as compared to cow's milk is: March 2011,March 2013 (b)",Rich in lactose,Rich in Vitamin D,Rich in minerals,Rich in proteins,"Ans. A: Rich in lactose Lactose content of human milk is 7.4g/100 gm whereas that of cows milk is 4.4 g/100 grams Human milk The initial milk produced is often referred to as colostrum, which is high in the immunoglobulin IgA, which coats the gastrointestinal tract. This helps to protect the newborn until its own immune system is functioning properly, and creates a mild laxative effect, expelling meconium and helping to prevent the build up of bilirubin (a contributory factor in jaundice). During the first few days after delivery, the breasts produce colostrum. This is a thin yellowish fluid that is the same fluid that leaks from the breasts during pregnancy. It is rich in protein and antibodies that provide passive immunity to the baby (the baby's immune system is not fully developed at bih). Colostrum also helps the newborn's digestive system to grow and function properly. After 3 to 4 days, breasts will begin producing milk that is thin, watery, and sweet. This quenches the baby's thirst and provides the proteins, sugar, and minerals that the baby needs. Foremilk, the milk released at the beginning of a feed, is watery, low in fat, and high in carbohydrates relative to the creamier hindmilk, which is released as the feed progresses. The breast can never be truly 'emptied,' since milk production is a continuous biological process. The level of Immunoglobilin A (IgA) in breast milk remains high from day 10 until at least 7.5 months post-paum. Human milk contains 1.1% protein, 3.4% fat, 7.4% carbohydrates, and 0.1% ash (minerals). Carbohydrates are mainly lactose. The fat fraction contains specific triglycerides of palmitic and oleic acid (0-P-0 triglycerides), and also quite a large quantity of lipids with trans bonds. They are vaccenic acid, and Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) accounting for up to 6% of the human milk fat. The principal proteins are casein (homologous to bovine beta-casein), alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, IgA, lysozyme, and serum albumin. In an acidic environment such as the stomach, alpha-lactalbumin unfolds into a different form and binds oleic acid to form a complex called HAMLET. Non-protein nitrogen-containing compounds, making up 25% of the milk's nitrogen, include urea, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, amino acids, and nucleotides. It is now universally recognized that there is no commercial formula that can equal breast milk. In addition to the appropriate amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat, breast milk provides vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, and hormones - all of the things that a growing infant will require. Breast milk also contains antibodies and lymphocytes from the mother that help the baby resist infections. The immune function of breast milk is individualized, as the mother, through her touching and taking care of the baby, comes into contact with pathogens that colonize the baby, and, as a consequence, her body makes the appropriate antibodies and immune cells. This is the reason why breast milk contains very little iron, as iron is an essential precursor to the activation of micro bacteria and gut flora; providing iron in the milk would lead to infection. However, the internal iron supplies of the infant, held in the hepatic cells of the liver, are exhausted at 4-6 months, hence this is the time that complimentary feeding is introduced, as to prevent anemia (recommended by WHO). Whole cow's milk It does not contain sufficient vitamin E, iron, or essential fatty acids, which can make infants fed on cow's milk anemic. Whole cow's milk also contains excessive amounts of protein (3.2 g/ 100 gram), sodium, and potassium, which may put a strain on an infant's immature kidneys. In addition, the proteins and fats in whole cow's milk are more difficult for an infant to digest and absorb than the ones in breast milk. A significant minority of infants are allergic to one or more of the constituents of cow's milk, most often the cow's milk proteins. These problems can also affect infant formulas derived from cow's milk.",A

The following CXR shows,Metastasis to lungs,Pneumothorax,Pneumatocele,Bronchial adenoma,"Ans. (a) Metastasis to lungs* Metastatic malignant neoplasms are the most common form of secondary lung tumors. Lung metastases are identified in 30-55% of all cancer patients, though prevalence varies based on the type of primary cancer.* Chest radiography (CXR) is the initial imaging modality used in the detection of suspected pulmonary metastasis in patients with known malignancies. Chest CT scanning without contrast is more sensitive than CXR* The most common radiographic pattern of pulmonary metastasis is the presence of multiple nodules, ranging in size from 3 mm to 15 cm or more.* The nodules are more common in the lung bases (owing to higher blood flow than upper lobes) and in the outer third of the lungs in the subpleural region.* They are approximately spherical and of varying sizes. Nodules of same size are believed to originate at the same time, in a single shower of emboli from the primary tumor. Nodules that are smaller than 2 cm are usually round and have smooth margins. Larger nodules are lobulated and have irregular margins; they may become confluent with adjacent nodules, resulting in a conglomerate multinodular mass.",A

For example, HbA/S heterozygotes(sickle cell trait) have a sixfold reduction in the risk of dying from severe falciparum malaria. Hemoglobin S-containing RBCs impair parasite growth at low oxygen tensions, and P. falciparum-infected RBCs containing hemoglobins S and C exhibit reduced cytoadherence because of reduced surface presentation of the adhesin PfEMP1.

Treatment of methemoglobinemia is done with -,Methylene blue,Hydroxyurea,Fava beans,Exchange tranfiision,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Methylene blue Methemoglobinemias* Methemoglobin is generated by oxidation of the heme iron moieties to the ferric state, causing a characteristic bluish-brown muddy color resembling cyanosis.* Methemoglobin has such high oxygen affinity that virtually no oxygen is delivered. Levels >50-60% are often fatal.* Congenital methemoglobinemia arises from globin mutations that stabilize iron in the ferric state or from mutations that impair the enzymes that reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin (e.g., methemoglobin reductase, NADP diaphorase).*Acquired methemoglobinemia is caused by toxins that oxidize heme iron, notably nitrate and nitrite-containing compounds, including drugs commonly used in cardiology and anesthesiology.* Methemoglobin should be suspected in patients with hypoxic symptoms who appear cyanotic but have a PaO2 sufficiently high that hemoglobin should be fully saturated with oxygen.* A history of nitrite or other oxidant ingestions may not always be available; some exposures may be inapparent to the patient, and others may result from suicide attempts.* The characteristic muddy appearance of freshly drawn blood can be a critical clue. The best diagnostic test is methemoglobin assay, which is usually available on an emergency basis.* Methemoglobinemia often causes symptoms of cerebral ischemia at levels >15%; levels >60% are usually lethal.* Intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg of methylene blue is effective emergency therapy.* Milder cases and follow-up of severe cases can be treated orally with methylene blue (60 mg three to four times each day) or ascorbic acid (300-600 mg/d).",A

Yellowing of the skin occurs in hypothyroidism because of:,Increased bilirubin,Increased cholesterol,Increased carotene,Increased,"Answer is C (Increased Carotene): The yellow colour of skin in patients with hypothyroidism results from the accumulation of carotene (carotenoderma) in the top layer of the epidermis (Stratum Corneum). Increased levels of carotene are believed to result from impaired hepatic conversion of beta-carotene to Vitamin A. 7'4 is essential for conversion of carotene to vitamin A. In hypothyroidism, this reaction is very slow and carotene accumulation in the blood and tissue (carotenaemia) gives a yellow colour to the skin (carotenoderma).

This is usually colicky or cramping in nature, felt in the lower abdomen and relieved by defecation. Abdominal bloating worsens throughout the day; the cause is unknown but it is not due to excessive intestinal gas. The bowel habit is variable. Most patients alternate between episodes of diarrhoea and constipation but it is useful to classify them as having predominantly constipation or predominantly diarrhoea. Those with constipation tend to pass infrequent pellety stools, usually in association with abdominal pain or proctalgia. Those with diarrhoea have frequent defecation but produce low-volume stools and rarely have nocturnal symptoms. Passage of mucus is common but rectal bleeding does not occur.

"A 73-year-old man with history of hypertension and osteoarthritis is evaluated for gradually increasing dyspnea over the preceding 6 weeks. He takes metoprolol for hypertension and naproxen for the arthritis. He has occasionally awakened in the night with mild dyspnea relieved by sitting up but has not noticed edema. Physical examination shows BP of 148/94, HR 96, and RR 16. O2 saturation is 92%. Neck veins show the jugular column 7 cm above the sternal angle. Lung examination reveals mild basilar crackles but no wheezing. Cardiac examination shows sustained apex impulse, S4 gallop, and no murmur. There is no peripheral edema. ECG shows stable left ventricular hypertrophy; no Q waves are seen. Chest x-ray shows increased interstitial markings and some cephalization of flow to the upper lobe vessels. The cardiac silhouette is boot-shaped, but there is no definite cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy and LV ejection fraction of 55% (normal 50%-70%). What is the likely pathogenesis of this patient's dyspnea?",Increased metabolic demands leading to high-output heart failure (HF),Occult coronary artery disease with dyspnea as an angina equivalent,Impaired diastolic relaxation and filling,Interstitial lung disease (ILD) mimicking pulmonary vascular congestion,"The most likely explanation for this patient's presentation is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), also known as diastolic dysfunction. As many as 50% of patients presenting with definite HF (Heart failure) will have an ejection fraction above 50%. HFPEF is more common in the elderly, in women, and those with conditions (especially hypertension) that lead to LV hypertrophy. Often the echocardiogram will show evidence of impaired relaxation or increased stiffness of the LV (the latter often suggested by decreased flow across the MV during atrial systole, giving the so-called reversed e/a flow ratio). Tachycardia, by decreasing diastolic filling time, will often worsen HF symptoms in diastolic dysfunction. As opposed to systolic HF, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have not demonstrated long-term survival benefit. Management focuses on controlling BP, preventing tachycardia, and treating pulmonary and peripheral fluid overload with diuretics; so many of the modalities used in systolic HF are also employed in HFPEF, just without proof of survival benefit.High output HF due to an AV fistula, Paget disease, or hyperthyroidism can mimic diastolic HF, but the patient usually has evidence of a hyperdynamic circulation (tachycardia, wide pulse pressure, hyperdynamic precordium). Occult CAD should be considered in patients with exertional dyspnea (which can be an angina equivalent), but this patient's rest symptoms and pulmonary vascular congestion would be unusual. In HF due to coronary artery disease, there is almost always evidence of prior MI or ischemic change on ECG. Nevertheless, a stress test is often obtained in patients with unexplained HF to rule out this possibility. Interstitial lung disease can cause rales and interstitial changes on CXR but would not explain the cephalization of flow nor the elevated venous pressure. Measuring B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) will resolve the issue in equivocal cases; BNP will be elevated in HF and normal or minimally elevated in ILD. Anemia can cause fatigue and exertional dyspnea and, rarely, even overt HF, but to cause HF the anemia would have to be very severe (usually Hb 7 g/dL or below) and should be apparent from the physical examination. In addition, severe anemia would usually cause evidence of hyperdynamic circulation as seen in high-output HF.",C

Third generation IUCD is,ML CuT 250,MIRENA,CuT 380A,Copper 7,"THIRD GENERATION IUDs A third generation of IUDs *based on still another principle, i.e., release of a hormone have become available on a limited scale. The most widely used hormonal device is progestase, which is a T -shaped device filled with 38 mg of progesterone, the natural hormone. The hormone is released slowly in the uterus at the rate of 65 mcg daily. It has a direct local effect on the uterine lining, on the cerl mucus and possibly on the sperms. Because the hormone supply is gradually depleted, regular replacement of the device is necessary. Another hormonal device LNG-20 (Mirena) is a T-shaped IUD releasing 20 mcg of levonorgestrel (a potent synthetic steroid); it has a low pregnancy rate (0.2 per 100 women) and less number of ectopic pregnancies. Long-term clinical experience with levonorgestrel releasing IUD has shown to be associated with lower menstrual blood loss and fewer days of bleeding than the copper devices. The levonorgestrel releasing IUD has an effective life of 10 years. The hormonal devices would be paicularly valuable for women in developing countries in whom excess blood loss caused by ine devices have been shown to result in significant anaemia. But these devices are more expensive, to be introduced on a wide scale. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 548",B

Insulin glargine (15 units subcutaneously at bedtime) has recently been started because of a hemoglobin A1C level of 8.4. Over the weekend, she develops nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after exposure to family members with a similar illness. Afraid of hypoglycemia, the patient omits the insulin for 3 nights. Over the next 24 hours, she develops lethargy and is brought to the emergency room. On examination, she is afebrile and unresponsive to verbal command. Blood pressure is 84/52. Skin turgor is poor and mucous membranes dry. Neurological examination is nonfocal; she does not have neck rigidity.Laboratory results are as follows:Na: 126 mEq/LK: 4.0 mEq/LCl: 95 mEq/LHCO3: 22 mEq/LGlucose: 1100 mg/dLBUN: 84 mg/dLCreatinine: 3.0 mg/dLWhich of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's coma?",Diabetic ketoacidosis,Hyperosmolar nonketotic state,Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion,Drug-induced hyponatremia,"This woman with poorly controlled diabetes has developed hyperglycemia and lethargy during an episode suggestive of viral gastroenteritis. Her presentation is most consistent with hyperosmolar nonketotic state. This condition typically occurs in type 2 diabetics who become volume depleted and develop renal insufficiency. Glucose is no longer able to spill out into the urine, the blood glucose skyrockets, and severe hypertonicity leads to brain dysfunction and coma. Serum osmolarity is calculated by the formula:18Plasmaglucose +2(Na++K+)+2.8bloodureanitrogen This patient's serum osmolarity is as follows:181100 +(126+4)+2.884 =61+260+30=351Thus, the serum osmolarity is greater than 350 mOsm/L. Although the serum sodium is usually the main determinant of osmolarity, extreme hyperglycemia contributes significantly to this patient's hypertonicity. Osmotically active particles in the extracellular fluid space pull water out of the intracellular space. This causes cellular dehydration in the brain and consequently the patient's CNS changes.Diabetic ketoacidosis would be associated with a much lower serum bicarbonate level and with an elevated anion gap. This patient's anion gap is 9 mEq/L (126-), which is well within the normal range. This patient's hyponatremia is minimal and is related to the osmotic effects of hyperglycemia. Patients with SIADH have an inappropriate production of ADH, leading to water retention and consequent hypotonicity (not hypertonicity, as in this case). The diagnosis of SIADH or drug-induced hyponatremia cannot be made in the setting of severe hypovolemia. Although the oral hypoglycemic chlorpropamide can cause drug-induced hyponatremia, this patient was not taking a sulfonylurea. Although meningitis can be associated with hyponatremia, this patient's hypertonicity and lack of meningeal signs point toward hyperosmolar nonketotic state as the cause of her illness.",B

In the given question, a cardiologist found a highly significant correlation coefficient (r = 0.90, p= 0.01) between the systolic blood pressure values and serum cholesterol values of the patients attending his clinic, Since r = + 0.90 (p = 0.01; implies significant relationship), it means there is a strong positive correlation between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and serum cholesterol (SC); therefore as SBP increases, SC will also increase and vice-versa. Thus, a patient with a high level of systolic BP is also likely to have a high level of serum cholesterol AND a patient with a low level of systolic BP is also likely to have a low level of serum cholesterol. Since r = + 0.9; Coefficient of determination = r2 = (0.9)2 = 0.81 Interpretation of r2: 0.81 or 81% of variation in systolic blood pressure among patients can be explained by their serum cholesterol values and vice-versa.",A

NRR is defined as:,Total number of children in a family,Number of daughters a newborn girl will bear during her lifetime,Total number of members in family,Total number of female children in a family,"Ans: b (Number of daughters a newborn girl....) Ref: Park, 19th ed, p.Net Reproduction rate (NRR) is defined as number of daughters a newborn girl will bear in her life time assuming fixed age specific fertility and mortality rates. NRR is a demographic indicator. The present level of NRR is 1.5 in India (1990). NRR of 1 is equivalent to attaining 2 child norm. NRR=1 can be achieved only if at least 60% of eligible couples are effectively practicing family planning. Fertility related statisticsQuestions were asked from this topic. Just go through the following important fertility rates.General fertility rate- is the number of live births per 1000 women in the reproductive age group (15-44 or 49 years) in a given year.GFR is a better measure of fertility than crude birth rate.General Marital fertility rate- is the number of live births per 1000 married women in the reproductive age group (15-44 or 49 years) in a given year.Age-specific Fertility rate (ASFR)- is defined as the number of live births per 1000 women in any specified age group in a given year.ASFR shows the fertility pattern. They are also sensitive indicator of family planning achievement.ASFR =Number of live births in a particular age groupMid year female population of same age groupx 1000Total fertility rate (TFR)- represents the average number of children a woman would have if she were to pass through her reproductive years bearing children at the same rate as the woman now in each age group. It is obtained by summing the age specific fertility rates for all ages. This measure gives the approximate magnitude of 'completed family size.'TFR= 5x OASFR",B

"A patient presents with low grade fever, his ECG is as shown below. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Acutemyocardial infarction,Old myocardial infarction,Pericarditis,Hypothermia,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) is very useful in the diagnosis of acute pericarditis. Characteristic manifestations of acute pericarditis on ECG most commonly include diffuse ST-segment elevation. However, other conditions may have ECG features similar to those of acute pericarditis. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium (the fibrous sac surrounding the hea).Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp chest pain.The pain may also be felt in the shoulders, neck, or back. It is typically better sitting up and worse when lying down or breathing deeply.Other symptoms may include fever, weakness, palpitations, and shoness of breath. Occasionally onset of symptoms is gradual. Substernal or left precordial pleuritic chest pain with radiation to the trapezius ridge (the bottom poion of scapula on the back) is the characteristic pain of pericarditis. The pain is usually relieved by sitting up or bending forward, and worsened by lying down (both recumbent and supine positions) or by inspiration (taking a breath in). The pain may resemble that of angina but differs in that pericarditis pain changes with body position, where hea attack pain is generally constant and pressure-like. Other symptoms of pericarditis may include dry cough, fever, fatigue, and anxiety. Due to its similarity to the pain of myocardial infarction (hea attack), pericarditis can be misdiagnosed as a hea attack. Acute myocardial infarction can also cause pericarditis, but the presenting symptoms often differ enough to warrant diagnosis. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2776",C

(A) asymmetry, benign lesions are symmetric; (B) border irregular, most nevi have clear-cut borders; (C) color variation, benign lesions have uniform color; (D) diameter, >6 mm is more likely to be malignant. In addition, recent rapid change in size is also helpful in distinguish benign from malignant lesions. Thickness of the tumor is the most important prognostic factor in the majority of cases, and ulceration indicates a more aggressive cancer with a poorer prognosis.

"In comparing the moality experience of 2 countries, standardization of rate is done due to differences in",Cause of death,Denominator,Age distribution,Numerator,"Standardized moality ratio (SMR) The simplest and most useful form of indirect standardization is the Standardized Moality Ratio (SMR). In England, it is the basis for the allocation of government money to the health regions of the country. The concept is That the regions with higher moality also have the higher morbidity, and should therefore receive propoionately higher funding to combat ill-health. Standard moality ratio is a ratio (usually expressed as a percentage) of the total number of deaths that occur in the study group to the number of deaths that would have been expected to occur if that study group had experienced the death rates of a standard population (or other reference population). In other words. SMR compares the moality in a study group (e.g., an occupational group) with the moality that the occupational group would have had if they had experienced national moality rates. In this method, the more stable rates of the larger population are applied to the smaller study group. It gives a measure of the likely excess risk of moality due to the occupation. SMR= Observed deaths /Expected deaths X lOO The SMR has the advantage over the direct method of age adjustment in that it permits adjustment for age and other factors where age-specific rates are not available or are unstable because of small numbers. One needs to know only the number of persons in each age group in the study population and the age-specific rates of the national population (or other reference population). It is possible to use SMR if the event of interest is occurrence of disease rather than death Ref : Park 23rd edition Pgno : 59",C

A broader concept is emerging, that is , to develop an overall integrated programme for the Prevention and control of NCDs as part of primary health care systems, simultaneously attacking several risk factors known to be implicated in the development of NCDs. Such concerted preventive actions should reduce not only cardiovascular diseases but also other major NCDs.'
Prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) :
1. Population strategy :

Focus on control of underlying causes (risk factors) in whole populations, 'not merely by individuals'
Principle: Small changes in risk factor levels in total populations can achieve the biggest reduction in mortality, thus aim should be 'to shift the whole curve or risk factors towards biological normality'
Specific interventions:
1. Dietary changes: Dietary modification is the principal preventive strategy in the prevention of CHD;

WHO recommended changes (Prudent diet-dietary goals):
i. Reduction of fat intake to < 20 — 30 % of total energy intake
ii. Consumption of saturated fats < 10 % of total energy intake
iii. Reduction in dietary cholesterol to < 100 mg/1000 kcal/day
iv Increase in complex carbohydrate consumption
v. Reduction of salt intake to ≤ 5 gms per day
vi. Avoidance of alcohol consumption
vii. Primordial prevention
2. High risk strategy :

Identifying risk: by using simple tests for blood pressure, serum cholesterol measurement El Specific advice: to those identified at high risk

3. Secondary prevention :

Aim: to prevent reoccurrence and progression of NCDs
Most promising results have come from beta-blockers

Which one of the following serum levels would help in distinguishing an acute liver disease from chronic liver disease?,Aminotransaminase.,Alkaline phosphatase,Bilirubin.,Albumin,"Answer is D (Albumin) Only minimal changes in serum albumin are seen in acute liver conditions. Hypoalbuminemia is common in chronic liver disorders such as cirrhosis. In hepatitis serum albumin levels of less than 3g/dl (hypoalbuminemia) should raise the possibility of chronic liver disease' Albumin as marker for liver dysfunction Serum albumin is synthesized exclusively by hepatocytes Serum albumin has a long half life and is degraded very slowly (approx 4% is degraded per day.) Because of this slow turnover, the serum albumin is not a good indicator of acute hepatic dysfunction. Acute liver conditions are associated with only minimal changes in serum albumin (Albumin levels may be normal or minimally altered in viral hepatitis drug related hepato-toxity and obstructive jaundice) Chronic liver conditions are associated with hypoalbuminemia reflecting decreased albumin synthesis from severe and prolonged liver dysfunction. Remember: Hypoalhuntinemia is not specific for liver disease and may occur in protein malnutrition of any cause, protein losing enter apathies nephritic syndrome and chronic infections. Aminotransferases are used as indicators of extent of hepatocellular injury. They may be elevated in both acute and chronic hepatocellular disorders. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme used as markers of cholestasis and again may be elevated in both acute and chronic cholestatic disorders. Bilirubin levels also may be elevated in both acute and chronic liver disease.",A
A 20 years-old-male patient had sudden onset of weakness losing shortly 2 years back. Now presents with again sudden onset weakness. Investigation of choice is,Serum electrolytes,Edrophonium test,ENMG,Haemoglobin,"(B) Edrophonium test > Involvement of two or four limbs distally suggests lower motor neuron or peripheral nerve disease. Acute distal lower limb weakness occurs occasionally from an acute toxic polyneuropathy or cauda equina syndrome. Distal symmetric weakness usually develops over weeks, months, or years and is due to metabolic, toxic, hereditary, degenerative, or inflammatory diseases of peripheral nerves. Drugs that inhibit the enzyme AChE allow ACh to interact repeatedly with the limited number of AChRs, producing improvement in the strength of myasthenic muscles. Edrophonium is used most commonly for diagnostic testing because of the rapid onset (30 s) and short duration (about 5 min) of its effect. An objective endpoint must be selected to evaluate the effect of edrophonium. Examiner should focus on one or more unequivocally weak muscle groups and evaluate their strength objectively For example, weakness of extraocular muscles, impairment of speech, or the length of time that the patient can maintain the arms in forward abduction may be useful measures. An initial dose of 2 mg of edrophonium is given intravenously. If definite improvement occurs, the test is considered positive and is terminated. If there is no change, the patient is given an additional 8 mg intravenously. The dose is administered in two parts because some patients react to edrophonium with unpleasant sideeffects such as nausea, diarrhea, salivation, fasciculations, and rarely with severe symptoms of syncope or bradycardia.

It comprises: Undernutrition, Overnitrition, Imbalance and Specific deficiency. Main victims are children under 15 years. Children under 5 years are hit the hardest. Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition. Waterlow&;s classification of PEM: It defines two groups- 1. Malnutrition with a retarded growth, in which a drop in height/age ratio points to a chronic condition - shoness/stunting. It is an index of duration of malnutrition 2. Malnutrition with a low weight fir a normal height, in ehich the weight for height ratio is indicative of acute condition of rapid weight loss/ wasting .

Reaction is read at 48 hrs and 21 days.Two types of positive reactions have been described.Early Reaction or Fernandez reactionthis appears as an area of redness and induration at the site of inoculationit develops within 24 to 48 hrs and disappears after 3 to 4 days.the reading is taken at 48 hrs, and if the area of redness is more than 10 mm, the test is considered positive.Late Reaction or Mitsuda reactionthis reaction develops late, becoming apparent in 7-10 days following the infection and reaches peak in 3 or 4 weeks. A nodule develops at the site of inoculation.the reading is taken at 21 days and if the nodule is more than 5 mm in diameter, the reaction is said to be positive.The early reaction is induced by soluble constituents of the leprosy bacilli; and the late reaction by the bacillary component of the antigen.The early positive reaction indicates whether or not a person has been previously sensitized by exposure to an infection by leprosy bacilli. It is thus more superior to late reaction.The early reaction corresponds to the Mantoux reaction in tuberculosis.In the first 6 months of life, most children are lepromin negative; gradually with increasing age more and more persons become positive.BCG vaccination can convert lepra reactions from negative to positive in large no. of individuals.",B

Hypovolemic shock is seen in all except,Hemorrhage,Starvation,Vomiting,Diarrhoea,"This most common form of shock results either from the loss of red blood cell mass and plasma from hemorrhage or from the loss of plasma volume alone due to extravascular fluid sequestration or GI, urinary, and insensible losses. The signs and symptoms of nonhemorrhagic hypovolemic shock are the same as those of hemorrhagic shock, although they may have a more insidious onset. The normal physiologic response to hypovolemia is to maintain perfusion of the brain and hea while attempting to restore an effective circulating blood volume. There is an increase in sympathetic activity, hyperventilation,collapse of venous capacitance vessels, release of stress hormones, and an attempt to replace the loss of intravascular volume through the recruitment of interstitial and intracellular fluid and by reduction of urine output. Mild hypovolemia (<=20% of the blood volume) generates mild tachycardia but relatively few external signs, especially in a supine young patient ( Table 270-5 ). With moderate hypovolemia (~20-40% of the blood volume), the patient becomes increasingly anxious and although normal blood pressure may be maintained in the supine position, there may be significant postural hypotension and tachycardia. If hypovolemia is severe (>=40% of the blood volume), the classic signs of shock appear; the blood pressure declines and becomes unstable even in the supine position, and the patient develops marked tachycardia, oliguria, and agitation or confusion. Perfusion of the central nervous system is well maintained until shock becomes severe. Hence, mental obtundation is an ominous clinical sign. ref:harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2219",B

Dicrotic pulse differs from pulse bisferiens in,Seen in HOCM,Indicates high stroke output,"Characterized by two palpable weak waves, one in systole and other in diastole","Characterized by 2 palpable weak waves, both in systole","Ans. c (Characterized by two palpable weak waves, one in systole and other in diastole) (Ref. Harrison, Principles of Medicine - 18th/Chapter 227)The bisferiens pulse, which has two systolic peaks, is characteristic of aortic regurgitation (with or without accompanying stenosis) and of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the latter condition, the pulse wave upstroke rises rapidly and forcefully, producing the first systolic peak ('percussion wave'). A brief decline in pressure follows because of the sudden midsystolic decrease in the rate of left ventricular ejection, when severe obstruction often develops. This pressure trough is followed by a smaller and more slowly rising positive pulse wave ('tidal wave') produced by continued ventricular ejection and by reflected waves from the periphery. The dicrotic pulse has two palpable waves, one in systole and one in diastole. It usually denotes a very low stroke volume, particularly in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.# Pulsus alternans (pulses normalis aggregans) is a pattern in which there is regular alteration of the pressure pulse amplitude, despite a regular rhythm. It is due to alternating left ventricular contractile force, usually indicates severe impairment of left ventricular function, and commonly occurs in patients who also have a loud third heart sound. Pulsus alternans may also occur during or following paroxysmal tachycardia or for several beats following a premature beat in patients without heart disease.# In pulsus bigeminus, there is also a regular alteration of pressure pulse amplitude, but it is caused by a premature ventricular contraction that follows each regular beat.# In pulsus paradoxus, the decrease in systolic arterial pressure that normally accompanies the reduction in arterial pulse amplitude during inspiration is accentuated. In patients with pericardial tamponade, airway obstruction, or superior vena cava obstruction, the decrease in systolic arterial pressure frequently exceeds the normal decrease of 10 mm Hg and the peripheral pulse may disappear completely during inspiration.ARTERIAL PULSESVARIOUS ARTERIAL PULSESMECHANISMETIOLOGYPulsus paradoxusDecrease in SBP (< 10 mm Hg) that normally accompanies decrease in arterial pulse amplitude during inspiration is accentuated.It refers to a fall in systolic pressure >10 mmHg with inspiration.# Pericardial effusion# Pericardial temponade# Pulmonary embolism (massive)# SVC obstruction# Hemorrhagic shock# Severe obstructive lung disease# Tension pneumothorax.Pulsus bigeminusRegular alteration of pressure pulse amplitude, but it is caused by a premature ventricular contraction that follows each regular beat.PVCsPulsus alternansRegular alteration of pressure pulse amplitude, despite regular rhythm, (defined by beat-to-beat variability of pulse amplitude.

Erythropoitin is absolutely necessary for the treatment of-,Liver failure,Hea failure,Lung failure,End stage renal failure,"erythropoietin (Epo) in clinical practice, more than two decades ago, altered completely the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The successful correction of anemia of CKD has resulted in reduction of associated morbidity and improvement of functionality, exercise tolerance, cognitive function and overall quality of life. Moreover, significant reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and moality has occurred. Recently, large randomized clinical studies suggested that administration of Epo targeting at complete anemia correction is accompanied by significant increase of morbidity and moality, compared to paial anemia correction. This observation has led to thorough investigation of the mechanisms of Epo actions and the possible contribution of other parameters including iron availability, comorbidities and resistance or hyporesponsiveness to Epo. In this context, it has been proposed that high doses of Epo are likely to exe toxic effects and pleiotropic systemic actions. Recognition of the extra-hematopoietic biologic actions of erythropoietin is a result of the better understanding of its interaction with Epo receptors in several tissues and organ systems, during fetal development as well as in the adult organism. More specifically, antiapoptotic, anti- inflammatory, angiogenetic and cytoprotective effects have been revealed in the kidneys, cardiovascular system, brain and retina Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 391",D

"A 47-year old woman was referred for bone pain and abnormal findings on radiography. The patient repoed that for the past 17 years, she has habitually consumed water from that area. She repoed a 5-years history ofpain in the lower back, arms, legs and hips, Because of brittleness, all her teeth had been extracted. Radiography ofthe forearm revealed interosseous membrane calcification and radiography ofthe spine revealed a rugger-jersey appearance (striated pattern of increased density in the upper and lower zones of the veebrae). The probable diagnosis is",Silicosis,Fluorosis,Vitamin B toxicity,Hypercalcinosis,"Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by excessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones. In advanced cases, skeletal fluorosis causes painful damage to bones and joints. Symptoms are mainly promoted in the bone structure. Due to a high fluoride concentration in the body, the bone is hardened and thus less elastic, resulting in an increased frequency of fractures. Other symptoms include thickening of the bone structure and accumulation of bone tissue, which both contribute to impaired joint mobility. Ligaments and cailage can become ossified. Most patients suffering from skeletal fluorosis show side effects from the high fluoride dose such as ruptures of the stomach lining and nausea. Fluoride can also damage the parathyroid glands, leading to hyperparathyroidism, the uncontrolled secretion of parathyroid hormones. These hormones regulate calcium concentration in the body. An elevated parathyroid hormone concentration results in a depletion of calcium in bone structures and thus a higher calcium concentration in the blood. As a result, bone flexibility decreases making the bone more susceptible to fractures Mechanism of action The best way to view the mechanism of action by which fluorine breaks down bones and causes skeletal fluorosis is in a stepwise fashion. Fluoride enters the body by two paths: Ingestion or respiration. Both paths lead to corrosion of exposed tissue in high concentrations. Since the most likely form of fluoride to enter the body is hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas, this is what stas the process. Exposed tissues will be utilized by HF in neutralization reactions. This will leave F- free to pass fuher into the body. It reacts with the concentrated HCl in the stomach to form the weak acid, HF. This compound is then absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract and passes into the liver the poal vein. Since elemental F is one of the strongest oxidizers currently known, the anion F- is immune to phase 1 metabolic reactions, which are generally oxidation reactions, in the liver. These reactions are the body's first line of defense to biotransform harmful compounds into something more hydrophilic and more easily excreted. The HF is now free to pass into the blood stream and be distributed to all tissues including bones. Bones are largely composed of Ca compounds, paicularly carbonated hydroxyapatite (Ca 5(PO 4) 3(OH)); the reaction of Ca2+ ions and HF forms an insoluble salt, CaF 2. This salt must be cleared by the body, which concomitantly leaches out some of the calcium that would be pa of the bone matrix. This process results in increased density, but decreased strength in bones As of now, there are no established treatments for skeletal fluorosis patients. However, it is reversible in some cases, depending on the progression of the disease. If fluorine intake is stopped, the amount in bone will decrease and be excreted urine. However, it is a very slow process to eliminate the fluorine from the body completely. Minimal results are seen in patients. Treatment of side effects is also very difficult. For example, a patient with a bone fracture cannot be treated according to standard procedures, because the bone is very brittle. In this case, recovery will take a very long time and a pristine healing cannot be guaranteed. However, fuher fluorosis can be prevented by drinking defluoridated water. It is recently suggested that drinking of defluoridated water from the ''calcium amended-hydroxyapatite'' defluoridation method may help in the fluorosis reversal. Defluoridated water from this suggested method provides calcium-enriched alkaline drinking water as generally fluoride contaminated water has a low amount of calcium mineral and drinking alkaline water helps in eliminating the toxic fluoride from the body Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 715",B
The most common cause of Chyluria is:,Carcinoma,Tuberculosis,Filariasis,Trauma,"Answer is C (Filariasis): The most common cause of chyluria is development of fistulous connection between the lymphatics and urinary system from occlusion and subsequent rupture of the lymphatics by filarial infection. Chyluria refers to the passage of chyle in the urine and is characterized by the passage of white coloured, milk-like urine which is often aggravated by a heavy meal. It represents the development offistulous connections between the lymphatic and the urinary system. Etiologically, Chyluria may be parasitic or nonparasitic. Parasitic chyluria is commoner in the tropics it occurs due to occlusion of the lymphatics usually from filarial infections, and rarely from other causes. Non-parasitic chyluria is rare, and typically occurs due to obstruction of the thoracic duct from various causes. Causes of Chvluria Parasitic diseases Wuchereria bancrofti (Filariasis; Most Common) Other Parasitic Infections (Less Common) Eustorngylous gigus Taenia echinococcus Ascaris lumbricoides Hymenolepis nana Schistosoma hemotobium Non-parasitic diseases Chronic infection e.g. tuberculosis Neoplastic infiltration of retroperitoneal region Renal cell carcinoma Ureteric stone Trauma Pregnancy",C

Harrison, 17/e, p 1680-1681 & 16/e, p 1592 (15/e, p. 1524)).Hypocapnia is seen in ARDS.ARDS is an acute* diffuse* alveolar injury * that is caused by variety of aetiological factors. Patients with ARDS are often seriously ill with some other diseases and the features of ARDS are superimposed on it.It is characterized by acute diffuse alveolar damage leading to necrosis and loss of type I pneumocytes*. Endothelial damage also occurs leading to exudation of protein rich fluid into alveoli and resulting in pulmonary edema and formation of hyaline membrane*. Hyaline membrane is composed of fibrin* together with coagulated cell debris*. Hyaline membrane leads to decreased compliance and stiff lung.These changes result in diffusion defects. Due to low diffusion capacity of 02 hypoxemia occurs. Hypoxemia causes increase in respiratory rate due to which C02 wash out occurs so the level of CO2 is low in ARDS.Criteria for diagnosis of ARDS are:Antecedent history of precipitating conditions.Refractory hypoxemia* - Pa02 < 60 mmHg.Radiological evidence of newly evolving bilateral pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary edema*.A pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) less than 15-18 mmHg in the presence of normal colloid oncotic pressure.Total thoracic compliance less than 30 ml/cm H2O.",C
A patient with salicylic acid poisoning has the following aerial blood gas analysis repo : pH = 7.12 : pCO2 = 18mmHg; HCO3 = 12mmol/L. The resulting acid base abnormality can be best labeled as:,Metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis,Metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis,Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis,Metabolic acidosis,"Answer is A (Metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis): With pH < 7.35 (7.12) acidosis is confirmed. Abbnormal CO2 with change in opposite to expected. (acidosis should have increased CO2) indicates that the change in compensatory (compensatory respiratory alkalosis), Decreased bicarbonates with change in keeping with change in pH suggests that the problem is metabolic. Thus the whole picture respresents metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Explanation : Acid base disorders needlessly, confuse many people, but if a few simple rules are applied then interpretation and diagnosis are easy. pH < 7.35 is acidosis ; pH > 7.45 is alkalosis If change in HCO3 is termed as metabolic If change in HCO3- is in keeping with the pH (i.e. if there is acidosis and HCO3- decreased) the problem is a Metabolic one. If change in HCO3 is opposite with the pH (if there is acidosis and HCO3 is increased or normal) the problem is compensatory metabolic. If change is CO2 is termed as respiratory If change in CO2 is in keeping with the pH (if in acidosis CO2 is raised) the problem is termed respiratory If change in CO2 is opposite with the pH (if there is acidosis and CO2 is decreased or normal) problem is termed as compensatory respiratory. STEP III : Final deduction Because metabolic component is primary and respiratory component is compensatory the acid base disorder is Metabolic acidosis with compensatory Respiratory alkalosis.",A

Orlistat at the standard dose of 120 mg is taken with each of the three main meals of the day; a lower dose (60 mg) is available without prescription in some countries. these effects may be explained because patients taking orlistat adhere better to low-fat diets in order to avoid unpleasant gastrointestinal side-effects.

Tolvaptan is approved for use in-,High Na,High K,High Ca,Low Na,"Tolvaptan is a vasopressor receptor antagonist used to correct hyponatremia in the treatment of syndrome of inappropriate water excretion or SIADH :-
Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH is caused due to excesive secretion of antiduretic hormone.
Antidiuertic hormone (ADH) or arginine vasopressin is synthesized by the hypothalamus.
Its major effect is to prevent diuresis by promoting reabsorption of water in the kidneys.

- ADH is the primary physiological determinant of the rate of free water excretion.
- Its major renal affect is to augument the water permeability of the leminal membranes of the cortical and medullary collecting tubules thereby promoting water reabsorption.

The antidiuretic effect of ADH is mediated by 'V2  receptors'.
Tolvaptan is V2 receptor antagonist

- It can be used to correct hyponatremia due to excesive water retnetion caused by increased ADH secretion.

Randomized double blind trials have shown that oral or intravenous vasopressin antagonists are more effective than placebo in raising the serum sodium of hyponatremic patients.
'Tolvaptan' and 'conivaptan' but not lixivaptan are approved for use in the united states.

​Vasopressor receptor antagonist 

There are three receptor for vasopressin (ADH).
	- The V1 a, Vlb and V2 receptors.
The V2 receptors primarily mediate the antidiuretic response while V1 a and Vlb primarily cause vasoconstriction and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release.


V2               →        Mediate antidiuretic response
VlaVlb         →         Cause vasoconstriction and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release.

​

The vasopressin receptor antagonist tolavaptan produces a selective water diuresis (aquaresis) without affecting sodium and potassium excretion.

- The ensuing loss of electrolyte free water will tend to raise the serum sodium in patients with SIADH and may improve mental status in patients with serum sodium under 130 meq/L.

Health promotion comes under: March 2013 (e),Primary level of prevention,Secondary level of prevention,Teiary level of prevention,Primordial prevention,"Ans. A i.e. Primary level of prevention Primary Prevention It is used before the person gets the disease. Primary prevention aims to prevent the disease from occurring. So primary prevention reduces both the incidence and prevalence of a disease. Encouraging people to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet rays is an example of primary prevention of skin cancer. Secondary Prevention Secondary prevention is used: -- After the disease has occurred, but -- Before the person notices that anything is wrong. A doctor checking for suspicious skin growths is an example of secondary prevention of skin cancer. The goal of secondary prevention is to find and treat disease early. In many cases, the disease can be cured. Teiary Prevention Teiary prevention targets the person who already has symptoms of the disease The goals of teiary prevention are: Prevent damage and pain from the disease - Slow down the disease - Prevent the disease from causing other problems (These are called 'complications.') - Give better care to people with the disease - Make people with the disease healthy again and able to do what they used to do Developing better treatments for melanoma is an example of teiary prevention.

A 70 year old man develops pneumonia and septicemia. Patient goes into renal failure and has a BP of 70/50 mm of Hg. Drug that should be used to maintain BP is:,Adrenaline,Ephedrine,Phenylephrine,Nor epinephrine,"Answer is D (Norepinephrine) The patient in question is presenting with features of septic shock. Dopamine is the initial recommended vasopressor agent to maintain blood pressure but is not provided amongst the options. Patients who remain hypotensive despite dopamine should he adminstered norepinephrine and hence norepinephrine is the single best answer of choice here. Harrison 14th / 221 Treatment of septic shock Iffluid therapy alone fails to restore adequate aerial pressure and organ perfusion , therapy with vaso pressor agent should be intitiated. For the persistantly hypotensive patient dopamine frequently raises aerial pressure and maintains or enhances blood flow to the renal and splanchnic circulation. Patients who remain hypotensive despite dopamine require nor epinephrine, a more potent vasopressor. Once hypotension, has been corrected to optimize oxygen delivery to tissues, raising a low cardiac index with dobutamine can be useful - Harrisons 16th / 605 : Treatment of septic shock In the presence of sepsis, augmentation of cardiac output may require inotropic suppo with dopamine, nore pinephrine or vaso pressin in the presence of hypotension or with dobutamine if aerial pressure is normal",D

"In the birth weight of each of the 10 babies born in a hospital in a day is found to be 2.8 kgs, then the standard deviation of this sample will be -",2.8,0,1,0.28,"Standard deviation measures the variation (dispersion) of an individual data from the mean.
SD tells how tightly all the values are clustered around the mean in a set of data.
High standard deviation indicates that the data is dispersed away from the mean.
Low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to mean, i.e. data points are clustered close to the mean.
For example, the average height for adult men in USA is about 70 inches, and standard deviation is 3 inches. Then -


If dispersion of mean is 1 SD → most men (about 68%) have a height within 3 inches of the mean (67-73) inches.
If dispersion of mean is 2 SD → almost all men (95%) have a height within 6 inches of the mean (64 - 76) inches.
If dispersion is zero SD all men would be exactly 70 inches.


That means greater the standard deviation greater will be the data spread away from standard deviation.

It is caused by reversible dysfunction of podocytes. On light microscopy, the glomeruli appear normal , but fusion of podocyte foot processes is observed on electron microscopy. The presentation is with nephrotic syndrome, which typically is severe; it remits with high-dose glucocoicoid therapy (1 mg/kg prednisolone for 6 weeks), though the response to therapy is often less satisfactory in older patients. Some patients who respond incompletely (glucocoicoid-resistant) or relapse frequently need maintenance glucocoicoids (glucocoicoid dependence), cytotoxic therapy or other agents. Glucocoicoid resistance in children warrants a biopsy to exclude an alternative diagnosis, but if minimal change is confirmed, a genetic cause should be considered .Minimal change disease typically does not progress to CKD but can present with problems related to the nephrotic syndrome and complications of treatment.

"Gross hematuria, 3 days following an attack of UI in a young female is likely due to?",Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis,IgA nephropathy,Minimal change disease,Membranous glomerulonephritis,"The two most common presentations of IgA nephropathy are recurrent episodes of macroscopic hematuria during or immediately following an upper respiratory infection often accompanied by proteinuria or persistent asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. So the most likely diagnosis in this patient is IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy is an immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis defined by the presence of diffuse mesangial IgA deposits often associated with mesangial hypercellularity. A renal biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. There is no optimal treatment. Angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are given in patients with proteinuria or declining renal function. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis due to impetigo develops 2-6 weeks after skin infection and 1-3 weeks after streptococcal pharyngitis. This rules out Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis from the diagnosis in this case. Minimal change disease and Membranous Glomerulonephritis does not produce gross hematuria but instead microscopic hematuria.

Hypocalcemia with hypophosphatemia is seen in: September 2006,Crush injury,Rhabdomyolysis,Vitamin D dependent rickets-II,Renal failure,"Ans. C: Vitamin D dependent rickets-II In rhabdomyolysis due to crush injury, hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia may occur. Severe intravascular hemolysis may lead to a similar syndrome. Hyperphosphatemia alters calcium and phosphate ion solubility products, and calcium deposition in soft tissue may occur. The lower circulating concentrations of 1, 25 (OH)2D may fuher aggravate the hypocalcemia by impairing intestinal absorption of calcium. Hyperphosphatemic-induced hypocalcemia inhibits vitamin D synthesis and results in an increase in PTH secretion. Secondary hyperparathyroidism from long-term hyperphosphatemia is usually associated with renal insufficiency. Treatment should be directed towards the hyperphosphatemia in order to correct the hypocalcemia. Hypophosphatemia is more severe than hypocalcemia in vitamin D deficiency states because of the increased secretion of PTH, which is only paly active in elevating blood calcium but is capable of phosphaturia.",C

Objectives

An objective is a planned end-point of all activities.
It is a precise point. It is either achieved or not achieved.

Target

Target often refers to a discrete activity such as the number of blood films collected or vasectomies done, it permits the concept of degree of achievement.

Goal

A goal is defined as the ultimate desired state towards which objectives are directed.
Goals are not necessarily attainable
Unlike objectives and targets, goals are not constrained by time or existing resources.

Monitoring

Monitoring is the day-to-day follow-up of activities during their implementations to ensure that they are proceeding as planned and are on schedule.

Evaluation

Evaluation measures the degree to which objectives and targets are fulfilled and the quality of results obtained.
The purpose of evaluation is to assess the achievement of the stated objectives of a programme.

B! injection IM,Dextrose 50%,Dextrose 10%,Normal saline,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Vitamin Bt injection IMo In chronic alcoholics wernicke's encephalopathy may be precipitated by administration of intravenous glucose solution.o This occurs because chronic alcoholics are thiamine deficient.Thiamine deficiency in alcohol abusers results from a combination of inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption, decreased hepatic storage and impaired utilization.o Thiamine is a cofactor for several key enzymes important in energy metabolism including transketolase. alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase\Thiamine requirement depends upon metabolic rate with the greatest need, during periods of high metabolic demand and high glucose intake.This is manifested by precipitation of wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) in susceptible patients by administration of intravenous glucose before thiamine supplementation.Wernickes encephalopathy may be iatrogenic ally precipitated by glucose loading in patients with unsuscepected thiamine deficiency.To avoid this complication, it has become standard practice in emergency departments to administer thiamine prior to or alone with slucose infusion, particularly in those who are at risk for thiamine deficiency.Patients at risk for Wernicke's encephalopathy should also receive thiamine supplementation. As an example, patients admitted for alcohol withdrawal typically receive thiamine 100 mg daily.Because gastrointestinal absorption of thiamine is erratic in alcoholic and malnourished patients oral administration of thiamine is an unreliable treatment of wernicke s encephalopathy.",A

Which part of the brain is most affected in deep coma?,Brain stem,Locus ceruleus,Frontal lobe,RAS,"ANSWER: (D) RASREF: HARRISON'S 18th ed ch: 274The Anatomy and Physiology of ComaAlmost all instances of diminished alertness can be traced to widespread abnormalities of the cerebral hemispheres or to reduced activity of a special thalamocortical alerting system termed the reticular activating system (RAS).The proper functioning of this system, its ascending projections to the cortex, and the cortex itself are required to maintain alertness and coherence of thought. It follows that the principal causes of coma arelesions that damage the RAS in the upper midbrain or its projections:destruction of large portions of both cerebral hemispheres; andsuppression of reticulocerebral function by drugs, toxins, or metabolic derangementssuch as hypoglycemia, anoxia, uremia, and hepatic failure.The proximity of the RAS to midbrain structures that control pupillary function and eye movements permits clinical localization of the cause of coma in many cases. Pupillary enlargement with loss of light reaction and loss of vertical and adduction movements of the eyes suggests that the lesion is in the upper brainstem. Conversely, preservation of pupillary light reactivity and of eye movements absolves the upper brainstem and indicates that widespread structural lesions or metabolic suppression of the cerebral hemispheres is responsible for coma.",D

A 30-year-old male complains of loss of erection; he has low testosterone and high prolactin level in blood; What is the likely diagnosis:,Pituitary adenoma,Testicular failure,Cranio pharyngioma,Cushing's syndrome,"Answer is A (Pituitary adenoma): Pituitary adenomas produce excess prolactin which causes hypogonadism, decreased levels of testosterone and explains loss of erection. Pituitary adenomas (Prolactinomas) lead to an excess of prolactin. This inhibits hypothalamic release of LHRII resulting in defective LH & FSH secretion. Defective LH & FSH secretion in turn result in decreased levels of estrogen in females & testosterone in males. This is how prolactin excess can cause hypogaonadism In men prolactin excess can cause In females prolactin excess can cause Decreased Libido, impotence Irregular mensus (amenorrhea) Infeility.

Major symptoms of hypernatremia are,Cardiac,Neurologic,Respiratory,Musculoskeletal,"Hypernatremia increases osmolality of the ECF, generating an osmotic gradient between the ECF and ICF, an efflux of intracellular water, and cellular shrinkage. As in hyponatremia, the symptoms of hypernatremia are predominantly neurologic. Altered mental status is the most frequent manifestation, ranging from mild confusion and lethargy to deep coma. The sudden shrinkage of brain cells in acute hypernatremia may lead to parenchymal or subarachnoid haemorrhages and/or subdural hematomas; however, these vascular complications are primarily encountered in pediatric and neonatal patients. Osmotic damage to muscle membranes can also lead to hypernatremic rhabdomyolysis. Ref: Harrison 19e pg: 303",B

Which one of the following finding is Not associated with left-sided hea failure?,Pulmonary edema,Hepatojugular reflux,Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,Prerenal azotemia,"A hepatojugular reflux indicates liver congestion caused by the backup of blood into the venous circulation, secondary to problems in the right hea (e.g., right-sided hea failure, tricuspid stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation) An S3 hea sound occurs during the rapid-filling phase of the ventricle in early diastole. In mitral valve incompetence and increased preload in the left ventricle, an S3 hea sound is an excellent indicator of ventricular failure. The increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure is reflected back into the left atrium, with a subsequent increase in the hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary veins. When pulmonary venous pressure is greater than the pulmonary capillary onco tic pressure, a transudate leaks first into the interstitium (Kerley lines on a chest radiograph) and eventually into the alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema and congestion. Dyspnea, or the sensation of difficult or uncomfoable breathing, is the most common symptom of left sided hea failure. When a patient with left-sided hea failure lies down, the reduced gravitational force increases venous return to the hea. Because the left ventricle cannot handle the increased load, the blood backs up into the lungs, producing dyspnea. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea specifically refers to a choking sensation that wakens the patient at night. It usually subsides) to 20 minutes after the patient stands up, opens the window, and takes deep breaths. Another finding associated with left-sided hea failure is reduced renal perfusion, which occurs during the day due to the decreased cardiac output. Reduced cardiac output decreases the effective aerial blood volume and the glomerular filtration rate, allowing a greater reabsorption of urea in the proximal tubule. Because creatinine is neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate causes a minor increase in serum creatinine. The dispropoionate increase in the blood urea nitrogen level over that of the serum creatinine is called prerenal azotemia. Ref - Harrison's principles of internal medicine 20e / pubmed.com",B
Which is not true of hypocalcaemia -,Can occur in hypoparathyroidism,Latent tetany is seen,Prolonged QT interval,Inverse relation with Mg++ levels,"Hypocalcaemia is low calcium levels in the blood serum.The normal range is 2.1-2.6 mmol/L (8.8-10.7 mg/dl, 4.3-5.2 mEq/L) with levels less than 2.1 mmol/l defined as hypocalcemia.Mildly low levels that develop slowly often have no symptoms.Otherwise symptoms may include numbness, muscle spasms, seizures, confusion, or cardiac arrest Common causes include hypoparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency.Others causes include kidney failure, pancreatitis, calcium channel blocker overdose, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, and medications such as bisphosphonates.Diagnosis should generally be confirmed with a corrected calcium or ionized calcium level.Specific changes may be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG). Initial treatment for severe disease is with intravenous calcium chloride and possibly magnesium sulfate.Other treatments may include vitamin D, magnesium, and calcium supplements. If due to hypoparathyroidism, hydrochlorothiazide, phosphate binders, and a low salt diet may also be recommended.About 18% of people who are being treated in hospital have hypocalcemia The neuromuscular symptoms of hypocalcemia are caused by a positive bathmotropic effect (i.e. increased responsiveness) due to the decreased interaction of calcium with sodium channels. Since calcium blocks sodium channels and inhibits depolarization of nerve and muscle fibers, reduced calcium lowers the threshold for depolarization.The symptoms can be recalled by the mnemonic 'CATs go numb' - convulsions, arrhythmias, tetany, and numbness in the hands and feet and around the mouth. Petechiae which appear as on-off spots, then later become confluent, and appear as purpura (larger bruised areas, usually in dependent regions of the body). Oral, perioral and acral paresthesias, tingling or 'pins and needles' sensation in and around the mouth and lips, and in the extremities of the hands and feet. This is often the earliest symptom of hypocalcaemia. Carpopedal and generalized tetany (unrelieved and strong contractions of the hands, and in the large muscles of the rest of the body) are seen.

He was managed by prompt Endotrachcal intubation. After ET tube placement the maximal cardiac impulse shifted fuher to the right side. What should be the next step in management?,Confirm the position of endotracheal tube by chest X ray,Emergency surgery,Nasogastric tube inseion & decompress the bowel,Chest X ray to confirm diagnosis,"Answer is C (Nasogastric tube inseion ) : The ideal next step is to confirm the position of ET tube and / or Remove the tube and reattempt intubation, if the tube is not in the trachea. 'Removal of tube and reattempting intubation' is not provided amongst the option and position of the ET tube cannot be confirmed by chest X-ray. As both these possibilities are not provided in the list of options, the next best step is to decompress the bowel by nasogastric tube inseion and aspiration. This would help in relieving some respiratory distress and is therefore the single best answer of choice amongst the options provided. X-Ray chest should be next step after nasogastric tube inseion to confirm the diagnosis, followed by surgery once the patient has been resuscitated, investigated and stabilized.",C

Spider naevi are due to action of -,Estrogen,Androgen,Steroids,Progesterone,"The vascular spider, aerial spider or spider angioma or naevus is the most classical vascular lesion that is sometimes a presenting sign of chronic liver disease. Spider telangietasia occur in up to 10-15% of normal individuals and may also be seen in pregnant women (3rd trimester).They may also be seen in thyrotoxicosis, patients with rheumatoid ahritis, receiving estrogen therapy and women on oral contraceptives. In adults, spider nevi are usually seen over the face, neck, and upper pa of the trunk, and arms (vascular territory of the superior vena cava). It is unusual to find them below a line joining the nipples. They vary in size from 1 to 2 mm in diameter. It comprises a central aeriole represented by a red point from which numerous, small, twisted vessels radiate. Application of pressure on the central aeriole with the head of a pin or a match stick causes blanching of the whole lesion. Vascular spiders have been attributed to excessive levels of estrogen which cause blood vessels to enlarge and dilate. The presence of spider nevi is accompanied by an increased serum estradiol/free testosterone ratio in male cirrhotics.

A girl presented with severe hyperkalemia and peaked Twaves on ECG. Most rapid way to decreased serum potassium level.-,Calcium gluconate IV,Oral resins,Insulin + glucose,Sodium bicarbonate,"Management Treatment of hyperkalaemia depends on its severity and the rate of development, but opinions vary as to what level ofserum potassium constitutes severe hyperkalaemia and requires urgent treatment. Patients who have potassium concentrations <6.5 mmol/L in the absence of neuromuscular symptoms or ECG changes can be treated with a reduction of potassium intake and correction of predisposing factors. However, in acute and/ or severe hyperkalaemia (plasma potassium >6.5-7.0 mmol/L), more urgent measures must be taken . The first step should be infusion of 10 mL 10% calcium gluconate to stabilise conductive tissue membranes (calcium has the opposite effect to potassium on conduction of an action potential). Measures to shift potassium from the ECF to the ICF should also be applied, as they generally have a rapid effect and may ave arrhythmias. Ultimately, a means of removing potassium from the body is generally necessary. When renal function is reasonably preserved, loop diuretics (accompanied by intravenous saline if hypovolaemia is present) may be effective. In renal failure, dialysis may be required. Oral ion exchange resins, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS), have traditionally been used to bind and excrete gastrointestinal potassium. Thereare concerns, however, with regard to SPS's lack of proven efficacy and safety, with a number of repos of intestinal necrosis associated with its use. Alternative cation exchanges have been developed and are currently being trialled, with the aim of providing more effective and safer alternatives for the treatment of hyperkalaemia.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR4 occurs in about 70% of patients with rheumatoid ahritis HLA DR4 encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on,Chromosome 6,Chromsome 9,Chromosome 18,Choromosome 22,"Rheumatoid ahritis (RA) is a common form of inflammatory ahritis, occurring throughout the world and in all ethnic groups. The prevalence of RA is approximately 0.8-1.0% in Europe and the Indian subcontinent, with a female-to-male ratio of 3 : 1. The prevalence is lower in South-east Asia (0.4%). The highest prevalence in the world is in Pima Indians (5%). It is a chronic disease characterised by a clinical course of exacerbations and remissions . RA is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental components. The impoance of genetic factors is demonstrated by higher concordance of RA in monozygotic (12-15%) compared with dizygotic twins (3%), and an increased frequency of disease in first-degree relatives of patients. Genome-wide association studies have detected nearly 100 loci that are associated with the risk of developing RA. The strongest association is with variants in the HLA region. Recent studies have shown that the association with HLA is determined by variations in three amino acids in the HLA-DRb1 molecule (positions 11, 71 and 74) and single variants HLA-B (at position 9) and HLA-DPb1 (at position . The HLA locus is located on the sho arm of chromosome 6 and covers a 7.6 Mb region that contains over 250 highly polymorphic genes. The region is organized in three sub-regions: class I, class II and class III, which all have different functions. Both class I and II regions encode for glycoproteins that are expressed as cell surface receptors, whereas the class III region contains genes that encode for a variety of secreted immune system proteins, including complement factors and cytokines. The class I region encodes for three main subsets of HLA molecules; HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C. Class I HLA molecules are composed of an HLA-coded heavy a-chain and an invariant light chain, beta-2 microglobulin (b2m), which is essential for functional expression of the HLA molecule at the cell surface. The a-chain is folded to form a peptide-binding cleft that is 'closed' and can accommodate sho antigenic peptides, typically 8-10 amino acids long. These class I molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells and specialize in presentation of intracellular antigens, including viral antigens, to cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells. Genes in the class II region encode for HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ molecules as well as a few other related proteins. Class II HLA molecules are composed of an a-chain and a b-chain, both coded by the HLA class II region. Unlike the class I molecules, the peptide-binding cleft of class II molecules are 'open' which allows the accommodation of larger peptides of 15-20 amino acids long. Class II molecules are initially expressed on the cell surface of immune cells, in paicular antigen presenting cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells, as well as B cells and activated T cells. These molecules present antigens from outside the cell to (CD4+) T cells which in turn stimulate B cells to produce antibodies towards that specific antigen. This results in an antigen specific immune response. After activation of the immune system, the HLA class II molecules can be expressed on other cells. Ref - pubmed.com , Davidsons 23e p1044",A

Ideal temperature for DPT storage ?,Room temperature,4 to 8degC,0 to - 20degC,None.,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., 4 to 8degC o Storage --> DPT / DT vaccine should not be frozen, they should be stored in a refrigerator between 4 to 8degC. o Optimum age EPI has recommended that DPT vaccine can safely and effectively administered as early as 6 weeks after bih. o Number of doses Three doses are considered to be optimal for primary immunization. o Interval between doses --> The current recommendation is to allow an interval of 4 weeks between 3 doses, with a booster injection at 11/2 to 2 years, followed by another booster (DT only) at the age of 5-6 years. Dose Age DPTJ 6 weeks of age DPT2 10 weeks of age DPT3 14 weeks of age DPT300,, 16-24 months of age DT 5 years of age Booster o Mode and site of administration ---> IM at upper & outer quadrant of gluteal region. Also know o Since the severity of peussis infection decreases with age the peussis component in DPT vaccine is not usually recommended after the age of 6 years. o Therefore, children over the age of 5 years who have not received DPT, need only 2 doses of DT vaccine 4 weeks apa, with a booster dose 6 months to 1 year later. Those children who received the primary course of DPT earlier, should receive only DT as booster at 5-6 years or at school entry. o For immunizing children over 12 years of age and adults, the preparation of choice is DT --> 2 doses at an interval of 4 to 6 weeks, followed by a booster 6 to 12 months after the second dose.",B

Kyasanur forest disease is transmitted by: September 2011,Mite,Tick,Mosquito,None.,"Ans. B: Tick Vector for KFD in India is hard tick (Haemophysalis spinigera) Kyasanur Forest Disease/ KFD It is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to South Asia. The disease is caused by a virus belonging to the family flaviviridae, which also includes yellow fever and dengue fever. There are a variety of animals thought to be reservoir hosts for the disease, including porcupines, rats, squirrels, mice and shrews. The vector for disease transmission is Haemaphysalis spinigera, a forest tick. Humans contract infection from the bite of nymphs of the tick. The disease has a morbidity rate of 2-10%, and affects 100-500 people annually. The symptoms of the disease include a high fever with frontal headaches, followed by haemorrhagic symptoms, such as bleeding from the nasal cavity, throat, and gums, as well as gastrointestinal bleeding. An affected person may recover in two weeks time, but the convalescent period is typically very long, lasting for several months. There will be muscle aches and weakness during this period and the affected person is unable to engage in physical activities Prophylaxis by vaccination, as well as preventive measures like protective clothing, tick control, and mosquito control are advised. An attenuated live vaccine is now available. Specific treatments are not available",B
A functional test of primary hemostasis can be measured by:,Bleeding time,Activated paial thromboplastin time,Platelet count,Prothrombin time,"Platelet function is measured by bleeding time (normally 2-7 min), which is a functional test of primary hemostasis. The activated paial thromboplastin time, normally 22-36 sec, is the clotting time measured after addition of phospholipid to recalcified plasma that has been preincubated with paiculate material to initiate activation of the contact system (intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation cascade). The prothrombin time (PT) is the clotting time measured after addition of tissue thromboplastin to recalcified plasma (normal approximately 11-14 sec). The PT measures the activity of the extrinsic and common pathways. The platelet count, normally 150,000-400,000/mL, is determined as pa of an automated blood count. Fibrinogen concentration is frequently estimated from clotting time of diluted plasma after addition of excess thrombin. Ref: Palis J., Segel G.B. (2010). Chapter 6.

Hyperthyroidism as a high cardiac output state. Am Heart J. 1970 Feb;79(2):265-75.Explanation:Hyperthyroidism is the most common cause of hyperkinetic circulatory disease.Thyroid hormone probably produces this high output state by inducing vasodilatation of the circulatory beds supplying muscle and skin.This hormone induced effect lowers the total peripheral resistance which increases cardiac output.The heart responds to the low peripheral resistance by accelerating the heart rate and augmenting stroke volume.Thyroid hormone enhances ventricular contractility.These cardiac responses are generated by a direct effect of thyroid hormone on the cardiovascular system and are essentially independent of autonomic influence.",A

Correlation coefficient in this question is 0.9 (r = 0.90), i.e. there is strong positive correlation between systolic BP and serum cholesterol; therefore, a patient with high level of systolic BP is likely to have high level of serum cholesterol and a patient with low level of systolic BP is likely to have low level of serum cholesterol (option b and c are correct). To know the percentage of variation in a dependent variable that is explained by the Independent variable, coefficient of determination (r2) is used which interprets the value of coefficient of correlation between two variables: Coefficient of determination = (coefficient of correlation) 2 = (0.9)2= 0.8 I (81%) That means 81% of variation in systolic BP among patients can be explained by their serum cholesterol values.",A

"With regards to hereditary spherocytosis, which of the following is false",Usually has autosomal dominant inheritance,"Caused by mutations in genes for proteins such as spectrin, ankrin or band 3",Red blood cells are destroyed in the spleen,Aplastic crises are common,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Aplastic Crisis are common Aplastic crisis are a rare/uncommon complication of Hereditary Spherocytosis typically caused by virally induced bone marrow suppression. The most common aetiological agent that induces Aplastic Crisis in patients with Hereditary Spherocytosis is Parvovirus B19 Hereditary spherocvtosis usually has autosomal dominant inheritance caused by mutation in genes for proteins such as spectrin. ankrin or band 3. The genes responsible for HS include akyrin, b spectrin, band-3-protein, a-spectrin, and protein 4.2. In approximately two-thirds to three-quaer of HS patients, inheritance is autosomal dominant. In the remaining patients, inheritance is non-dominant due to autosomal recessive inheritance of a de novo mutation. In patients with hereditary spherocvtosis Red blood cells are destroyed in the spleen The spleen plays a critical role in the pathobiology of HS, as destruction of spherocytes in the spleen is the primary cause of hemolysis in HS patients. Aplastic Crisis is an Uncommon Complication Aplastic crisis following virally induced bone marrow suppression are uncommon, but may result in severe anaemia with serious complications including congestive hea failure or even death. The most common aetiological agent in these cases is parvovirus B19. Parvovirus selectively infects erythropoietic progenitor cells and inhibits their growth",D

Samogyi effect is -,Morning hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance,Morning hyperglycemia due to large dose of exogenous insulin,Morning hypoglycemia due to large dose of exogenous insulin,Evening hypoglycemia due to insulin resistance,"Answer- B. Morning hyperglycemia due to large dose of exogenous insulinRebound hyperglycemia, results from excess xogenous insulin, which causes hypoglycemia overnight and stimulates the release to counter regulatory hormones that in turn increase blood glucose levels.",B
A coho study is -,An analytical study,A descriptive study,A corelational trail,An experimental study,"Coho study is also known as incidence study. The cohos are identified prior to the appearance of disease under investigation. The study group so defined are observed over a period of time to determine the frequency of disease among them Ref: 25th edition, Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, Page no. 83",A
Multiple pregnancy resulting from Feilization of two ova discharged from ovary at different periods of ovulation is best termed as:,Superfecundation,Superfoetation,Pseudocyesis,Atavism,"Feilization of two ova discharged from ovary at different periods of ovulation is termed as Superfoetation. Superfoetation means the feilization of an ovum from a subsequent ovulation in a woman who is already pregnant. Superfecundation and Superfoetation: Superfecundation is feilization of second ova within the same menstrual cycle when one ovum has already being feilized. Superfetation is feilization and subsequent development of an embryo during the course of an established pregnancy. Superfecundation Superfoetation Superfecundation means feilization of two ova discharged from the ovary at the same period of ovulation (Same menstrual cycle) by spermatozoa introduced during two different acts of coitus committed at sho intervals Superfoetation means Feilization of two ova discharged from ovary at different periods of ovulation. It may also be defined as the felization of an ovum from a subsequent ovulation in a woman who is already pregnant Both feilized ova develop as twins and go to full term at about the same period Both feilized ova may develop as twins but typically one fetus always remains more developed than the other, and may be born either at the same time showing different maturation or may born at different periods.

Lisch Nodules are seen-,Neurofibromatosis I,Sturge weber's syndrome,Tuberous sclerosis,Von hippel lindau syndrome,"Ans. Is 'a' i.e., Neurofibromatosis I Neurofibromatosis type 1 -o Neurofibromatosis is a comparatively common hereditary disorder in which the skin, nevous system, bone, endocrine glands and sometimes other organs are at the sites of a variety of congenital abnormalities often taking the form of benign tumours.o The main feature of neurofibromatosis I is -Spots of hyperpigmentation andCutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromatous tumours.Hyperpigmentation in Neurofibromatosis I takes two formsCafe -au- lait sootsQo These are patches of pigmentation and they appear shortly after birthQ and occur anywhere on the body.o They are light brown in colour (cafe - au - lait) and do not change in number as the patient ages but they increase in size during puberty\o Presence of more than six cafe - au - lait spots > 1.5 cm in size is considered diagnostic of Neurofibromatosis.FrecklesQo Neurofibromatosis I is also characterized by the presence of Freckles like or diffuse pigmentation of the axillae and other intertriginous areas (groin, under breast) and small round whitish spots. When coupled with cafe au lait patches they are virtually pathognomonicQ of the disease.NeurofibromasCutaneous tumourso They are situated in the dermis and form discrete soft or firm papules.o They are flesh coloured or violaceous and often topped with comedo. When pressed, the soft tumours tend to invaginaie through a small opening in the skin giving the feeling of a seedless raisin or a scrotum without a testicle. This phenomenon is spoken of as 'button holding'.Subcutaneous tumourso They take two forms -Firm discrete nodules attached to a nerve.Plexiform neuromasQ (overgrowth of subcutaneous tissue sometimes reaching enormous size and occur most often in the face, scalp, neck and chest and may cause hideous disfigurement).Lisch NoduleQo This is another unique finding of neurofibromatosisQ.o It is a small whitish spotQ present in the iris.",A
Statistical Power of a trial is equal to:,1 + a,1 - b,a + b,a / b,Statistical power of a test Power of a statistical test = 1 - probability of type II error = 1 -b Is probability of rejecting a Null hypothesis when a predetermined clinically significant difference is a indeed present Power can be increased by increasing the no. of subjects in a trial,B
