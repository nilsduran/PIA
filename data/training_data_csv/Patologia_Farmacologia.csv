Question,A,B,C,D,Explanation,Answer
Hirschsprung colon is due to ?,Muscle atrophy in muscularis mucosa,Loss of intrinsic enteric plexuses,Loss of extrinsic nerve supply,None.,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Loss of intrinsic enteric plexuses Pathogenesis of Hirchsprung disease The entric neuronal plexuses develops from neural crest cells, which migrate into the bowel wall during development, mostly in a cephalad to caudad direction. Hirschsprung disease results when the migration of neural crest cells arrests at some point before reaching the anus - inappropriate premature death. This produces an intestinal segment that lacks both meissner submucosal and aurebach myenteric plexus. Loss of enteric neural coordination leads to functional obstruction and intestinal dilation proximal to the affected segment.",B

One of the following caused nephrotoxicity -,Azathioprine,Cyclophosphamide,Mycophenolate mofetil,Tacrolimus,"Tacrolimus Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant that is isolated from bacterium. It is used for the same purpose as cyclosporine i.e., it is being used to protect and treat liver and kidney grafts when conventional immunosuppressants fail. It suppresses the cell mediated immunity but it leaves patient with enough immunity to fight bacteria. Despite major differences in the chemical structure, tacrolimus and cyclosporine seems to have many effects in common:? It acts like cyclosporine Both the drugs inhibit the calcineurin pathways. Their adverse effect on kidney is indistinguishable i.e., - Tubular lesions - Aeriolopathy - Tufts like changes in glomeruli and vessels.

Commonest side effect of Dapsone is:,Hemolytic anemia,Thrombocytopenia,Cyanosis,Bone marrow depression,"ANTILEPROTIC DRUGS: CLASSIFICATION: Sulfone:dapsone Phenazine derivative:clofazamine Antitubercular drugs:rifampin,ethionamide other antibiotics:ofloxacin,moxifloxacin,minocycline,clarithromycin DAPSONE: Activity and mechanism: Dapsone is chemically related to sulfonamides and has the same mechanism of action, i.e. inhibition of PABA incorporation into folic acid; its antibacterial action is antagonized by PABA. Pharmacokinetics: Dapsone is completely absorbed after oral administration and is widely distributed in the body, though penetration in CSF is poor. It is 70% plasma protein bound, but more impoantly concentrated in skin (especially lepromatous skin), muscle, liver and kidney. Dapsone is acetylated as well as glucuronide and sulfate conjugated in liver. Metabolites are excreted in bile and reabsorbed from intestine, so that ultimate excretion occurs mostly in urine. The plasma tlh of dapsone is variable, though often > 24 hrs. The drug is cumulative due to retention in tissues and enterohepatic circulation. Elimination takes 1-2 weeks or longer. DAPSONE: 25, 50, 100 mg tab. Adverse effects: Dapsone is generally well tolerated at doses 100 mg/ day or less. Mild haemolytic anaemia is common. It is a doserelated toxicity-reflects oxidising propey of the drug. Patients with G-6-PD deficiency are more susceptible; doses > 50 mg/ day produce haemolysis in them. Gastric intolerance-nausea and anorexia are frequent in the beginning, decrease later. Other side effects are methaemoglobinaemia, headache, paresthesias, mental symptoms Contraindications: Dapsone should not be used in patients with severe anaemia with Hb < 7g%, G-6-PD deficiency and in those showing hypersensitivity reactions. Other use In combination with pyrimethamine, dapsone can be used for chloroquine-resistant malaria ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K.D.TRIPATHI SIXTH EDITION Page No:751,752",A

Methotrexate is used in all of the follow ing except:,Sickle cell anemia,Psoriasis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ans. a. Sickle cell anemia (Ref: Katzung l1/e p631-632; KDT 7/e p210, 863, 882, 6/e p203, 841]Methotrexate is not used in sickle cell anemia.'Methotrexate is now considered the first line DMA RD agent for most patients with Rheumatoid arthritis. The anti- inflammatory effect of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis appears to be related at least in part to interruption of adenosine and possible effect on TNF pathways.'Which DMARD should be the drag of first choice remains controversial and trials have failed to demonstrate a consistent advantage ofone over the other? Despite this, methotrexate has emerged as the DMARD of choice especially in individuals with risk factors for the development of bone erosions or persistent synovitis of >3 months duration because of its relatively rapidity of actiont its capacity to effect sustained improvement with ongoing therapy and the higher level of patient retention on therapy''Methotrexate is a folate antagonist, it causes reduction in cells reproductive abilities. Methotrexate affects cells, which divides quickly. In psoriasis cells divide more than usual. Methotrexate binds to these cells and inhibits enzymes involved in rapid growth of skin cells. It is commonly used to stop the progression ofpsoriatic arthritis and less commonly used in the treatment of severe psoriasis with no arthritis component Methotrexate is an effective antipsoriasis agent. It is especially useful in acute generalized pustular psoriasis, psoriatic erythroderma, psoriatic arthritis and extensive chronic plaque psoriasis.Methotrexate although widely used has not been shown benefit in ankylosing spondylitis. There is not enough evidence to be certain of the benefit and harms of methotrexatefor ankylosing spondylitis amhnore research is needed. In ankylosing spondylitis the use of methotrexate is not recommended for the axial manifestations. The drug may have some efficacy- in the peripheral involvement. For this disease there is lack of clinical trials and most of the trials did not show efficacy on the axial symptoms of the disease.",A

Which of the following is true of body iron stores?,Absorption is increased in iron deficiency and reduced in iron overload,Normally iron is stored as hemosiderin,Hepcidin increases iron absorption in iron overload,Transferrin is used as a storage form in iron overload,"IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA Iron Metabolism The amount of iron obtained from the diet should replace the losses from the skin, bowel and genitourinary tract. These losses together are about 1 mg daily in an adult male or in a non-menstruating female, while in a menstruating woman there is an additional iron loss of 0.5-1 mg daily. ABSORPTION. Iron is absorbed mainly in the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Iron from a diet containing haem is better absorbed than non-haem iron. Absorption of non-haem iron is enhanced by factors such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), citric acid, amino acids, sugars, gastric secretions and hydrochloric acid. Iron absorption is impaired by factors like medicinal antacids, milk, pancreatic secretions, phytates, phosphates, ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and tannates contained in tea. Transpo across the membrane is accomplished by divalent metal transpoer 1 (DMT 1). Once inside the gut cells, ferric iron may be either stored as ferritin or fuher transpoed to transferrin by two vehicle proteins--ferropoin and hephaestin. The major mechanism of maintaining iron balance in the body is by intestinal absorption of dietary iron. When the demand for iron is increased (e.g. during pregnancy, menstruation, periods of growth and various diseases), there is increased iron absorption, while excessive body stores of iron cause reduced intestinal iron absorption. TRANSPO. Iron is transpoed in plasma bound to a b-globulin, transferrin, synthesised in the liver. Transferrin-bound iron is made available to the marrow where the developing erythroid cells having transferring receptors utilise iron for haemoglobin synthesis. Transferrin is reutilised after iron is released from it. But in conditions where transferrin-iron saturation is increased, parenchymal iron uptake is increased. The storage form of iron (ferritin and haemosiderin) in RE cells is normally not functional but can be readily mobilised in response to increased demands for erythropoiesis.

Sickle cell anemia is characterized by:September 2010,Microcytosis,Macrocytosis,Splenomegaly,Autosplenectomy,"Ans. D: AutosplenectomySickle cell anemia causes autosplenism by causing hypoxia and infarcts in the spleen. Since in the spleen blood flow is sluggish, the oxygen tension is low.When red blood cells with hemogblobin S are exposed to this low oxygen tension they tend to aggregate and polymerize. Sickled cells also express more adhesion molecules and appear more sticky. The sickle cells arrest in the hypoxic vascular bed in the spleen, resulting in a vicious cycle: decrease in 02, sickling and vascular obstruction from thrombus formation. Initially the spleen is enlarged, then progressively becomes smaller. The stasis of flow in the spleen causes hypoxic damage, thrombosis, infarction and fibrosis. In the end the spleen 'disappears' completely (termed 'autosplenectomy').",D

All of the following are features of MEN 1 syndrome except: September 2007,Pancreatic tumor,Pituitary tumor,Hyperparathyroidism,Medullary carcinoma of thyroid,"Ans. D: Medullary carcinoma of thyroid MEN-1/Wermer syndrome is characterized by abnormalities involving the parathyroid, pancreas and pituitary gland; thus the mnemonic device, the 3P's. Parathyroid-Hyperparathyroidism is present in 80-95% of patients. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is the most common manifestation: about 25% of patients have evidence of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. In contrast to sporadic cases of hyperparathyroidism, diffuse hyperplasia or multiple adenomas are more common than solitary adenomas. Pancreas-Pancreatic islet cell tumors occur in 60 to 70% of patients. Tumors are usually multicentric. Multiple adenomas or diffuse islet cell hyperplasia commonly occurs; such tumors may arise from the small bowel rather than the pancreas. About 30% of tumors are malignant and have local or distant metastases. Malignant islet cell tumors due to MEN 1 syndrome often have a more benign course than do sporadically occurring malignant islet cell tumors. About 40% of islet cell tumors originate from a beta cell, secrete insulin (insulinoma), and can cause fasting hypoglycemia. Beta-Cell tumors are more common in patients < 40. About 60% of islet cell tumors originate from nonbeta-cell elements and tend to occur in patients > 40. Non-beta-cell tumors are somewhat more likely to be malignant Pituitary-Pituitary tumors occur in 15 to 42% of MEN 1 patients. From 25 to 90% are prolactinomas. About 25% of pituitary tumors secrete growth hormone or growth hormone and prolactin. Excess prolactin may cause galactorrhea and excess growth hormone causes acromegaly clinically indistinguishable from sporadically occurring acromegaly. About 3% of tumors secrete ACTH, producing Cushing's disease. Most of the remainder are nonfunctional.",D

Immediate sustained permeability in cells is increased by:,Direct injury and necrosis,Endothelial gaps by histamine,Endothelial gaps by serotonin,Leucocyte mediated endothelial injury,"Direct endothelial injury, resulting in endothelial cell necrosis and detachment:

This effect is usually encountered in necrotizing injury, and is due to direct damage to the endothelium by the injurious stimulus e.g. In severe burns or lytic lesions.
Neutrophils adhere to the endothelium, and may also injure the endothelium.
In most instances, leakage starts immediately after the injury and is sustained at a high level for several hours, until the damaged vessels are thrombosed or repaired.

Which of the following mechanisms explains these clinical and pathologic findings?",Accumulation of amyloid,Atherosclerosis of coronary aeries,Coxsackievirus myocarditis,Mutation of myosin chain genes,"Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as collagen vascular diseases, rheumatoid ahritis, and bronchiectasis, may lead in time to accumulation of a specific form of amyloid, known as AA (amyloid-associated protein). Systemic amyloidosis affects many organs, especially the hea, kidneys, spleen, GI tract, liver, and tongue. The ventricular walls become thickened and inelastic, and the resulting pathophysiologic picture is that of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Congestive hea failure ensues because of decreased ventricular compliance and secondary reduced stroke volume. Note how the ventricular lumen are narrowed and the walls are extremely thickened. A waxy texture is highly suggestive of amyloid deposition, which can be confirmed histologically by using Congo red staining.Note:Atherosclerosis of coronary aeries may give three different types of clinical manifestations: arrhythmias (with sudden death), angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction. Loss of myocardial tissue due to ischemic necrosis may lead to congestive hea failure. The hea will show evidence of old infarcts in the form of scars, and the ventricular cavities will become dilated. Coxsackievirus myocarditis is the most common etiologic form of viral myocarditis, which may resolve without clinical consequences or lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and hea failure. Mutations of myosin chain genes are the most common causes of hyperophic cardiomyopathy. This manifests with thickening of the interventricular septum (so-called asymmetric cardiac hyperophy), with resultant impediment to both systolic outflow and diastolic filling. Here, the ventricular walls are uniformly thickened, and the remaining postmoem findings (liver, kidney, and spleen changes) cannot be explained based on a diagnosis of hyperophic cardiomyopathy.

There is radiographic evidence of ulceration, stricturing, or fistulas of the small intestine and colon. Nonpharmacologic therapy can be efficacious in some cases, but more severe cases may require coicosteroids, such as prednisone, which dramatically suppress the clinical signs and symptoms. Antidiarrheal agents (eg, diphenoxylate with atropine or loperamide) should be used very cautiously in these patients since there is a very high risk of toxic megacolon.

Herceptin is used for which cancer ?,Breast,Thyroid,Cervical,Ovarian,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Breast Herceptin (Trastuzumab) Herceptin is a humanized antibody and is used in breast cancers which are HER2 positive. HER2 stands for :- human epidermal growth factor receptor. HER2 gene produces HER2 protein also called HER2 receptor. The HER2 protein is found on the surface of some normal cells in the body. In normal cells HER2 protein help send growth signals from outside the cell to the inside of the cell. These signals tell the cell to grow and divide. In HER2 (+ve) breast cancer the cancer cells have abnormally high number of HER2 genes per cell when this happens too much HER2 protein appears on the surface of these cancer cells. This is called HER2 protein over expression. Too much HER2 protein is thought to cause cancer cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. Herceptin acts in two ways: a) Herceptin attaches to HER2+ cancer cells and stimulates the bodys immune system to target the HER2-icancer cells b) Herceptin attaches itself to the HER2 receptors on the surface and blocks them from receiving the signals. Currently transtuzumab is approved for HER2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel as initial treatment or as monotherapy following chemotherapy.",A

Which is not a 2nd generation antihistaminic ?,Loraudine,Acrivastatine,Cyclizine,None of the above,"Cyclizine Histamine is a naturally occuring amine. It is found in most body tissues but is predominantly secreted by mast cells. Histamine acts as a local hormone (autacoid) i.e. it acts within the immediate vicinity of its release. It main physiological effects are on: Blood vessels ? - Aerioles are dilated - Capillary permeability is increased Smooth muscles -- Cause contraction of the smooth muscles G.I.T. -- Increase gastric acid secretion Histamine acts through two receptors - H1 --> mediates edema and vascular effects of Histamine - H2 --> mediates effect on gastic secretion. Hi receptor antagonists : T- hey are classified in two types (i) First generation antihistamines (ii) Second generation antihistamines The term antihistamine is unsatisfactory for the first generation or older generation antihistamine because besides blocking histamine receptors, they also show considerable blocking activity against - muscarinins receptors - serotonin receptors - a adrenergic receptors They also enter the brain readily and cause sedation. Because of their non-specificity and their highly sedative action, they have a great tendency to cause serious adverse effect. Because of these disadvantages, second generation antihistamines were developed which are more selective for H1 receptor and largely free of antimuscarinic and antiadrenergic activity. The newer second generation antihistamines penetrate the blood-brain barrier poorly and are largely devoid of sedative effects.",C
Gingival biopsy is used for diagnosis of -,Scurvy,Sarcoidosis,Amyloidosis,SLE,"BIOPSY EXAMINATION. Histologic examination of biopsy material is the commonest and confirmatory method for diagnosis in a suspected case of amyloidosis. Biopsy of an obviously affected organ is likely to offer the best results e.g. kidney biopsy in a case of dialysis, sural nerve biopsy in familial polyneuropathy. In systemic amyloidosis, renal biopsy provides the best detection rate, but rectal biopsy also has a good pick up rate. However, gingiva and skin biopsy have a poor result. Currently, fine needle aspiration of abdominal subcutaneous fat followed by Congo red staining and polarising microscopic examination for confirmation has become an acceptable simple and useful technique with excellent result.

Iodide uptakeo First step in the synthesis of T3 & T4 is iodide uptake.o Thyroid cells (follicular cells) have active transport system for iodine uptake - Na+ :I- symporter.o This trapping is stimulated by TSH.o The iodide concentrating mechanism (Na+ : I- symporter) is also found in skin, salivary glands, gastric mucosa, intestine, mammary glands and placenta, but uptake in these organs is not stimulated by TSH.2. Oxidation and iodinationo Iodide trapped by follicular cells is transported to colloid.o In colloid it is oxidised by membrane bound thyroid peroxidase to iodinium ion (I+) or hypoiodous acid (HOI) or enzyme - linked hypoiodate (E-OI).o These oxidized forms of iodine combines with tyrosine residues of thvroglobulin to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyorosine (DIT) (in this reaction no enzyme is required),o These MIT and DIT are attached to thvroglobulin.3. Couplingo Pairs of iodinated tyrosine residues couple together to form T3 and T4.o Coupling is an oxidation reaction and is catalysed by same membrane bound thyroid peroxidase,o Normally more T4 is formed than T3.o Oxidation and coupling are stimulated by TSH.4. Storage and releaseo Thyroglobulin containing MIT, DIT, T3 & T4 is transported into the follicular cells by endocytosis.o Inside the cells thyroglobulin is broken down by lysosomal proteases.o Released T4 & T3 are secreted into the circulation, released MIT and DIT are deiodinated and the iodide released is reutilized.o The uptake (endocytosis) and proteolysis of thyroglobuline are stimulated by TSH.5. Peripheral conversion of T4 to T3o Peripheral tissues, especially liver and kidney, convert T4 to T3.o Target tissues take up Tj from circulation for their metabolic need, except brain and pituitary which take up T4 and convert it to T3 within their own cells.o Propylthiouracil, propranolol, amiodarone and glucocorticoids inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.",A

In addition to microangiopathic HA, other causes of IV mechanical destruction of red cells include march hemoglobinuria and ceain types of infections, such as baonellosis and malaria. Aplastic anemia is a stem cell disorder of the bone marrow that causes a marked decrease in the production of marrow cells that results in extreme marrow hypoplasia. Patients present with symptoms related to pancytopenia (anemia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia). Because their bone marrow cannot respond normally, patients with aplastic anemia have no increased reticulocytes in the peripheral blood (no polychromasia). Aplastic anemia may be inherited (Fanconi's anemia) or acquired. The most common cause of aplastic anemia is drugs. Other causes include chemicals (benzene and glue sniffing), radiation, and ceain types of infections, such as hepatitis C. There are ceain predisposing conditions, such as PNH, that are associated with an increased risk of developing aplastic anemia. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",C

These tumors usually occur in women between 30 and 70 years of age. Phyllodes tumors resemble fibroadenomas in their overall architecture and the presence of glandular and stromal elements. Like fibroadenoma, benign phyllodes tumor is sharply circumscribed, and the cut surface is firm, glistening, and grayish white. Microscopically, the stroma of a benign phyllodes tumor is hypercellular and has mitotic activity. The distinction from fibroadenoma is made not on the size, but on the histologic and cytologic characteristics of the stromal component. Malignant phyllodes tumors have an obviously sarcomatous stroma with abundant mitotic activity, and the stromal component is increased out of proportion to the benign duct elements. They are usually poorly circumscribed, with invasion into the surrounding breast tissue. Sarcomatous elements are not features of the other choices.Diagnosis: Phyllodes tumor of the breast",D

Most common location of gastrinoma is:September 2007,Pancreas,Duodenum,Jejunum,Gall bladder,"Ans. B: DuodenumZollinger-Ellison syndrome is a disorder where increased levels of the hormone gastrin are produced, causing the stomach to produce excess hydrochloric acid.Often the cause is a tumor (gastrinoma) of the duodenum or pancreas producing the hormone gastrin. Gastrin then causes an excessive production of acid which can lead to peptic ulcers in almost 95% of patients.Gastrinomas may occur as single tumors or as multiple, small tumors. About one-half to two-thirds of single gastrinomas are malignant tumors that most commonly spread to the liver and lymph nodes near the pancreas and small bowel.

"In aortic dissection, blood enters in -",Intima,Media,Adventitia,Any of the above layer,"Aortic dissection 

Aortic dissection is a catastrophic illness characterized by dissection of blood between and along the laminar planes of aortic media.
Blood enters inside the arterial wall (in the media layer) and leads to the formation of blood-filled channels within the aortic wall, which often ruptures outward causing massive haemorrhage.
The most frequent pre-existing histologically detectable lesion is cystic medial degeneration.
In aortic dissection, there is an intimial tear through which the blood enters into the media.
Usually, the tear is within 10 cms of the aortic valve.
The dissecting hematoma spreads characteristically along the laminar planes of the aorta, usually between the middle and outer third.
Some times, blood ruptures into the lumen distally, i.e. there is the second tear distally. So that a complete new vascular channel is formed inside the media of aortic wall. Blood enters from proximal tear into the media and comes out into the lumen from the distal tear.
This is called double - barrel aorta with a false-channel in the media.
Later on, this false channel becomes endothelized → chronic dissection.

  Classification of Aortic dissection

The risk and nature of serious complications of dissection depend strongly on the level of aorta affected, with the most serious complications occurring from the aortic valve to the arch.
Thus aortic dissections are generally classified into two types -

1. Proximal lesion (Type A)

More common and more dangerous.
Involve either the ascending portion only or both ascending and the descending portion of aorta.

2.   Distal lesion (Type B)

Involve only descending part distal to the subclavian artery.",B

"Drug of choice for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia is: March 2010, September 2007and 2010, March 2013",Digoxin,Propranolol,Adenosine,Diltiazem,"Ans. C: Adenosine Initial measures to terminate SVT should include vagal maneuvers. If unsuccessful, termination can be achieved with antiarrhythmic drugs whose primary effects increase refractoriness and/ or decrease conduction (negative dromotropic effect) over the AV node. These drugs can have direct (e.g., verapamil blocks the slow-inward calcium current of the AV node) or indirect effects (e.g., digoxin increases vagal tone to the AV node). In most patients, the drug of choice is either adenosine or verapamil. The advantages of adenosine include its rapid onset of action (usually within 10-25 seconds a peripheral vein), sho half-life (less than 10 seconds) and high degree of efficacy. Its sho half-life minimizes the severity of side effects, such as facial flushing, chest tightness, dyspnea and transient sinus arrest and/or atrioventricular block. In general, adenosine has an excellent safety record, but pause-dependent torsade de pointes may infrequently occur and transient atrial fibrillation may occur due to shoening of the atrial action potential. Adenosine should be given with caution to patients with bronchospasm and is contraindicated in those with sinus node dysfunction or second- or third-degree hea block. Dipyridamole potentates adenosine's effects by blocking its cellular uptake and aminophylline blunts its effects by competitive receptor antagonism. Sequential dosing can be given at 60 second intervals due to adenosine's rapid metabolism. In AV node reentry the most common site of termination is the anterograde slow pathway. Termination may also occur indirectly, i.e., due to adenosine - induced atrial or ventricular premature beats",C

A degree of A-V block is naturally established in AF. Because of the relatively long ERP of A-V node, many atrial impulses impinge on it while it is still refractory; others falling early in the relative refractory period get extinguished by decremental conduction - These concealed impulses leave upper margin of A-V node refractory for a further period. Thus, any influence which increases atrial rate in AF (e.g. digitalis), by itself reduces ventricular rate.o Inhibition of Na+ K+ ATPase is responsible for inotropic action of digitalis, not for antiarrhythmic action.# Digitalis has two important pharmacological actions -Increased contractility of heart by inhibiting Na+ K+ ATPase - This action is beneficial in cardiac failure. Increased refractoriness of SA node and AV node -| automaticity and conduction - This action is beneficial in arrhythmia.",A
Which of the following drugs is most likely to cause myelosuppression,Famciclovir,Ganciclovir,Penciclovir,Fomivirsen,"Ganciclovir It is an analogue of acyclovir which is active against all herpes viruses including H. simplex, H. zoster, EBV and CMV against which it is most active. mech of action:- Ganciclovir is activated intracellularly by virus specific thymidine kinase and its triphosphate nucleotide preferentially inhibits viral DNA polymerase. This active metabolite attains much higher concentration inside CMV infected cells. The precursor cells in bone marrow are also quite sensitive to ganciclovir, and this may account for its bone marrow toxicity. Pharmacokinetics:- It has poor oral absorption, bioavailability of ganciclovir is low (<10%).Valganciclovir, the valyl prodrug, has ~ 8 times higher bioavailability, and is preferred, where available. Ganciclovir and its active metabolite are mostly excreted unchanged in urine.The plasma t 1/2 of ganciclovir is 2-4 hrs, but that of its triphosphate inside CMV infected cells is > 24 hrs. These factors account for its high activity against CMV infections. Systemic toxicity:- Toxicity of ganciclovir is high: bone marrowdepression, rash, fever, vomiting, neuropsychiatric disturbances. uses:- Use is restricted to prophylaxis and treatment of severe CMV infections (pneumonia/colitis/retinitis) in immunocompromised (AIDS, transplant recipient)patients. Treatment may be initiated with i.v. infusion of ganciclovir 10 mg/kg/day which can prevent blindness in AIDS patients with CMV retinitis. Ref:- kd tripathi; pg num:-801",B

HLA is also called Major histocompatibility complex. The histocompatibility antigens (human leukocyte antigens - HLA) are cell surface antigens that induce an immune response leading to rejection of allogrufts. The principal physiologic function of the cell surface histocompatibility molecules is to bind peptide fragments of foreign proteins for presentation to antigen specific T cells. The histocompatibility antigens are encoded by a closely linked multiallelic cluster of genes, Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or Human leukocyte antigens complex (HLA complex). - HLA complex of genes is located on the sho arm of chromosome 6. It consists of three separate clusters of genes: HLA Complex [MHC Responses of MHC molecules Class 1 MHC class I molecules bind and process peptide that are derived from proteins synthesized within the cells, e.g. viral protein in viral infected cells and antigen of cancerous cells. These cells (cancerous or virus infected) have a tendency to display unusual, non self antigens on their surface. After binding to MHC-I, these antigens are processed and presented to cytotoxic CD-8 T cells (MHC-I restricted). Cytotoxic CD-8 T cell - MHC I reaction cause -- Graft rejection - Cell mediated cytolysis of viral infected or tumor cells. Class II Class 11 molecules present exogenous antigen (e.g. extracellular microbes, soluble proteins). These antigens are first internalized and undergo proteolytic cleavage in lysosome.

Antitrypsin deficiency is associated with- (a) (b),Restrictive lung pathology,Cystric fibrosis,Emphysema,Carcinoma,"Pathogenesis of Emphysema

The most accepted theory in the pathogenesis of emphysema is protease - antiprotease mechanism which is responsible in the pathogenesis of two common forms of emphysema, i.e. centriacinar and panacinar.
The alveolar wall destruction results from an imbalance between proteases (mainly elastase) and antiproteases in the lung.
Proteases (elastase) cause the destruction of alveolar wall, while antiproteases prevent this damage.
α1 - antitrypsin is the major antiprotease (anti elastase) secreted by neutrophils during inflammation

A. Pathogenesis of panacinar emphysema

Panacinar emphysema is associated with congenital deficiency of α1 - antitrypsin.
This results in unchecked overactivity of neutrophil elastase that causes the destruction of alveolar wall.
As α1 - antitrypsin is deficient throughout the acinus, the acini are uniformly involved from the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli.
Neutrophils are the major cells in the pathogenesis of panacinar emphysema

B. Pathogenesis of centriacinar emphysema

Centriacinar emphysema is associated with smoking.
Nicotine acts as a direct chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages.
So, in centriacinar emphysema, both neutrophils and macrophages play a central role.
Smoking enhances the activity of neutrophil and macrophage elastase.
Macrophage elastase is not inhibited by a1 - antitrypsin and indeed can proteolytically digest this antiprotease.
Beside protease - antiprotease mechanism, oxidant-antioxidant imbalance also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of smoking-related emphysema.
Normally, the lung contains a healthy complement of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione).
Tobacco smoke contains abundant reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which deplete these antioxidant mechanisms.
Free radicals cause tissue damage, as well as they, inactivate α1 - antitrypsin, resulting in functional α1 - antitrypsin deficiency even in patients without enzyme deficiency.

Why smoking-related emphysema involves centriacinar portion?
The impaction of smoke particles occurs predominantly at the bifurcation of respiratory bronchioles, resulting in the influx of neutrophils and macrophages, both of which secrete proteases. An increase in protease activity localized in the centriacinar region, together with the smoke-induced oxidative damage, causes the centriacinar pattern of emphysema that is seen in smokers.",C
Osteogenesis imperfect defect in,Collagen type I,Elastin,Collagen type IV,basement membrane,"harshmohan textbook of pathology 7th edition. *osteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant or recessive disorder of synthesizing type1 collagen that constitutes 90 to 95 % bone matrix Osteogenesis Imperfecta Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as 'brittle bone disease,' is actually a group of genetic disorders caused by defec- tive synthesis of type I collagen. Because type I collagen is a major component of extracellular matrix in other pas of the body, there are also numerous extraskeletal manifesta- tions (affecting skin, joints, teeth, and eyes, for example). The mutations underlying OI characteristically involve the coding sequences for a1 or a2 chains of type I collagen. Because collagen synthesis and extracellular expo require formation of a complete and intact triple helix, any primary defect in a collagen chain tends to disrupt the entire structure and results in its premature degradation (an example of a dominant negative mutation) (Chapter 6). As a consequence, most defects manifest as autosomal domi- nant disorders and may be associated with severe malformations. There is, however, a broad spectrum of severity, and mutations that result in qualitatively normal collagen but at only reduced levels generally have milder manifestations. The fundamental abnormality in all forms of OI is too little bone, resulting in extreme skeletal fragility. Four major sub- types are recognized. The type II variant is uniformly fatal in utero or immediately postpaum as a consequence of multiple fractures that occur before bih. By contrast, patients with type I OI have a normal lifespan, with only a modestly increased proclivity for fractures during child- hood (decreasing in frequency after pubey). The classic finding of blue sclerae in type I OI is attributable to decreased scleral collagen content; this deficit causes a relative trans- parency that allows the underlying choroid to be seen. Hearing loss can be related to conduction defects in the middle and inner ear bones, and small misshapen teeth are a result of dentin deficiency. Ref Robbins 9/e p767",A

CLL and SLL are identical neoplasm/arise due to an abnormal neoplastic proliferation of B cells.
CLL involves primarily bone marrow and blood, while SLL involves lymph nodes

Morphology of CLL/SLL

The tumor cells of CLL are small B lymphocytes.
Leukemic cells have the morphological appearance of normal small to medium sized lymphocytes with clumped chromatin, inconspicuous nuclei and a small ring of cytoplasm.
The lymph node architecture is diffusely effaced by these tumor cells.
These cells are mixed with variable numbers of larger cells called prolymphocytes.
In many cases, prolymphyocytes gather together focally to form as proliferation centers, so called because they contain relatively large number of mitotic activity.
When present proliferation centers are pathognomonic for CLL/SLL.
In CLL, the peripheral blood contains increased numbers of small, round lymphocytes with scant frequently disrupted in the process of making smears, producing So called smudge cells..

Which of the following antimalarial drugs is safe for use in pregnancy?,Atovaquone,Tetracycline,Proguanil,Primaquine,Proguanil (Chloroguanide) It is a slow-acting erythrocytic schizontocide which also ihibits the preerythrocytic stage of P. falciparum. Gametocytes exposed to proguanil are not killed but fail to develop properly in the mosquito. It is cyclized in the body to a triazine derivative (cycloguanil) which inhibits plasmodial DHFRase in preference to the mammalian enzyme. Resistance to proguanil develops rapidly due to mutational changes in the plasmodial DHFRase enzyme. Current use of proguanil is restricted to prophylaxis of malaria in combination with chloroquine in areas of low level chloroquineresistance among P. falciparum. It can be employed during pregnancy.

Hence CAIS 'women ' do not have a uterus.o Testosterone is also produced at the appropriate time. However due to the complete inability of the androgen receptor to respond, the external genitalia do not virilise and instead undergo female development.o These patients have vagina instead of penis.o Other areas where testosterone may have important fetal effects, such as \hc brain, will also develop along the female path,o The result is a female (both physically and psychologically) with no uterus, testis present which is found at some point in their line of descent through the abdomen from the pelvis to the inguinal canal.o During puberty, breast development will be normal: however, the effects of androgens will not be seen, so pubic and axillary hair growth will be minimal.o Majority of women with CAIS have shortened vagina, when compared with normal average length of 10-12 cm.o The cause of this lies in the embroyological development of the vagina,* Upper portion of vagina-develops from mullerian ducts* Lower portion of vagina-develops from urogenital sinus. o In CAIS mullerian duct regresses, under the effect of mullerian inhibiting hormone, leaving just the part derived from the urogenital sinus.Clinical features of CAISo Female external genitaliao 46 xy karyotypeo Intrabdominal or inguinal testeso Absent uteruso Primary amenorrhoeao Reduced or absent sexual hair (pubic and axillary)o Norma! breast developmento Vaginal hypoplasia",B

A: Sucralfate Sucralfate has very poor acid neutralizing capacity and it has no antisecretory propey Sucralfate It is a cytoprotective agent, primarily indicated for the treatment of active duodenal ulcers. Sucralfate is also used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and stress ulcers. Unlike the other classes of medications used for treatment of peptic ulcers, sucralfate is a sucrose sulfate-aluminium complex that binds to the mucosa, thus creating a physical barrier that impairs diffusion of hydrochloric acid in the gastrointestinal tract and prevents degradation of mucus by acid. It also stimulates bicarbonate output and acts like an acid buffer with cytoprotective propeies Sucralfate is a locally acting substance that in an acidic environment (pH < 4) reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form a cross-linking, viscous, paste-like material capable of acting as an acid buffer for as long as 6 to 8 hours after a single dose. It also attaches to proteins on the surface of ulcers, such as albumin and fibrinogen, to form stable insoluble complexes. These complexes serve as protective barriers at the ulcer surface, preventing fuher damage from acid, pepsin, and bile. In addition, it prevents back diffusion of hydrogen ions, and adsorbs both pepsin and bile acids.",A

Characteristic feature of hyperophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is:-,Asymmetric septal hyperophy of septum,Increased size of atria,Increased size of ventricle,Normal myofiber arrangement,"Hyperophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common (incidence, 1 in 500), clinically heterogeneous, genetic disorder characterized by myocardial hyperophy, poorly compliant left ventricular myocardium leading to abnormal diastolic filling, and (in about one third of cases) intermittent ventricular outflow obstruction. The essential feature of HCM is massive myocardial hyperophy,usually without ventricular dilation. The classic pattern involves dispropoionate thickening of the ventricularseptum relative to the left ventricle free wall (with a ratio of septum to free wall greater than 3 : 1), termed asymmetric septal hyperophy. In about 10% of cases, the hyperophy is concentric and symmetrical. On longitudinal sectioning, the normally round-to-ovoid left ventricular cavity may be compressed into a 'banana-like' configuration by bulging of the ventricular septum into the lumen. Although marked hyperophy can involve the entire septum, it is usually most prominent in the subaoic region. The left ventricular outflow tract often exhibits a fibrous endocardial plaque associated with thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet. The most impoant histologic features of HCM myocardium are: (1) massive myocyte hyperophy (2) haphazard disarray of bundles of myocytes, individual myocytes, and contractile elements in sarcomeres within cells (termed myofiber disarray). (3) interstitial and replacement fibrosis Mutations causing HCM are found most commonly in the gene encoding b-myosin heavy chain (b-MHC), followed by the genes coding for cardiac TnT, a-tropomyosin, and myosin-binding protein C (MYBP-C).",A

Non competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase-,Allopurinol,Acetazolamide,Bimatoprost,Dipivefrine,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Acetazolamide o Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors act by a non-competitive, reversible inhibition of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.Carbonic anhvdrase inhibitors (acetazolamide)o Carbonic anhydrase (CAse) is an enzyme which catalyzes the reversible reaction H2O + CO2 - H2CO3 - H++HCO3-.o The enzyme is present in renal tubular cells (especially PT), gastric mucosa, exocrine pancrease, ciliary body of eye, brain and RBC.o Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors inhibit intracellular CAse in PT cells resulting in slowing of hydration of CO2 -decreased availability of H+ to exchange with luminal Na+ through Na+-H+ antiport,o Inhibition of brush border CAse retards dehydration of H2CO3 in the tubular fluid so that less C02 diffuses back into the cells.o The net effect is inhibition of HCO3- (and accompanying Na+) reabsorption in PT - alkaline diuresis.o Secretion of H+ in DT and CD is also inhibited. Though H+ is secreted at this site by H+-ATPase, it is generated in the cell by CAse mediated reaction. As such, this is a subsidiary site of action of CAse inhibitors,o For the same degree of natriuresis CAse inhibitors cause most marked kaliuresis compared to other diuretics.Read belowCollecting tubule is the most important site of K+ secretion by the kidney.K+ secretion occurs in exchange with Na+If Na+ load is higher in collecting tubels it will be absorbed in exchange with K+ and more K+ will be secreted, i.e. higher the Na+ load in CD, higher will be K+ excretion in urine.Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors act on proximal tubules, where maximum Na+ (70%) is absorbed -they block this absorption and will cause maximum kaliuresis (K+ excretion in urine).o Extrarenal actions of acetazolamideLowering of IOT due to decreased formation of aqueous humour.Decreased gastric HCL and pancreatic NaHCO3 secretion.Raised level of CO2 in brain and lowering of pH - sedation and elevation of seizure threshold.Alteration of CO2 trasport in lungs and tissues,o Uses of CAse inhibitors* Glaucoma# Acute mountain sickness# Periodic paralysis* Epilepsy# To alkalinise urine for UTI or to promote excretion of acidic drugso Dorazolamide and brinzolamide are used topically for glaucoma.o Adverse effectsHypersensitivity reactions in patients sensitive to sulfonamides (CAse inhibitors are sulfonamide derivatives).Bone marrow depression, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, drowsiness, paresthesias, fatigue and abdominal discomfort.In hepatic diseases may precipitate hepatic coma by interfering with urinary elimination of NH3.o Contraindications for carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.COPD # Hepatic cirrhosis # Hyperchloremic acidosiso Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide) can cause allergic reactions in patients hypersensitive to sulfonamides.",B

A 49-year-old male presents with symptoms that developed following a long weekend of binge drinking. His serum reveals a g-glutamyl transferase (GGT) level of 65 IU/L. A liver biopsy reveals fatty change (steatosis) of numerous hepatocytes. This patient's liver abnormality is most likely the result of,Decreased free fatty acid delivery to the liver,Decreased production of triglycerides,Increased mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids,Increased NADH production,"Alcohol can produce hepatic steatosis several mechanisms, such as increased fatty acid synthesis, decreased triglyceride utilization, decreased atty acid oxidation, decreased lipoprotein excretion, and increased lipolysis. Ethanol is taken up by the liver and is conveed into acetaldehyde by either alcohol dehydrogenase (the major pathway), microsomal P-450 oxidase, or peroxisomal catalase. These pathways also conve nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH. This excess production of NADH changes the normal hepatic metabolism away from catabolism of fats and toward anabolism of fats (lipid synthesis), resulting in decreased mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids and increased hepatic production of triglyceride. Ethanol also increases lipolysis and inhibits the release of lipoproteins. Increased lipolysis increases the amount of free fatty acids that reach the liver.

Dapoxetine is specifically developed for?,Depression,Psychosis,Premature ejaculation,Anxiety disorder,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Premature ejaculation Dapoxetine Dapoxetine is the first compound developed specially for the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE) in men 18-64 years old. Dapoxetine works by inhibiting the serotonin transpoer, increasing serotonin's action at the post synaptic cleft, and as a consequence promoting ejaculatory delay. As a member of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) family, dapoxetine was initially created as an antidepressant. However, unlike other SSRIs, dapoxetine is absorbed and eliminated rapidly in the body. Its fast-acting propey makes it suitable for the treatment of PE but not as an antidepressant.",C

"A 50-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse is found to have elevated liver enzymes. A liver biopsy shows the microscopic features of steatosis. If the patient abstains from fuher drinking, this condition will most likely evolve into which of the following?",Acute hepatitis,Chronic hepatitis,Complete regression,Hyperplastic nodules,"The picture shows a classic case of liver steatosis or fatty change, which results from accumulation of fat within hepatocytes. Alcohol is one of the most frequent causes of liver steatosis. At least in pa, the mechanism of alcohol-induced steatosis is due to acetaldehyde formation, which disrupts microtubules and increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio. Fatty change of the macrovesicular type is entirely reversible if the noxious stimulus (in this case, excessive alcohol intake) is removed. Acute hepatitis results from acute insults to the liver. Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by hepatocyte necrosis, intracytoplasmic hyaline bodies (Mallory bodies), and neutrophilic infiltration. Usually, alcoholic hepatitis develops after a bout of heavy alcohol consumption. Fatty change may be superimposed on histologic signs of hepatitis, but steatosis does not evolve into hepatitis if alcohol intake is discontinued. Chronic hepatitis may result from long-term heavy alcohol consumption and is characterized by chronic inflammation of poal spaces and progressive fibrosis. Steatosis is usually associated with chronic hepatitis due to alcohol. Hyperplastic nodules represent a morphologic component of cirrhosis. Foci of hepatocyte hyperplasia develop as a compensatory mechanism to continuous loss of hepatocytes.",C

Progenitor hematopoietic stem cells originate in which of the following?,Bone marrow,Thymus,Lymph node,Spleen,"Key Concept:
By birth, marrow throughout the skeleton is hematopoietically active and hepatic hematopoiesis dwindles to a trickle, persisting only in widely scattered foci that become inactive soon after birth.
Haematopoietic Organs
In the human embryo, the yolk sac is the main site of haematopoiesis in the first few weeks of gestation. By about 3rd month, however, the liver and spleen are the main sites of blood cells formation and continue to do so until about 2 weeks after birth. Haematopoiesis commences in the bone marrow by 4th and 5th month and becomes fully active by 7th and 8th month, so that at birth practically all the bones contain active marrow. During normal childhood and adult life, therefore, the marrow is the only source of new blood cells. However, during childhood, there is progressive fatty replacement throughout the long bones, so that by adult life the hematopoietic marrow is confined to the central skeleton (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, skull, sacrum and pelvis) and proximal ends of femur, tibia and humerus. Even in these hematopoietic areas, about 50% of the marrow consists of fat. Non-hematopoietic marrow in the adult is, however, capable of reverting to active hematopoiesis in certain pathologic conditions. The spleen and liver can also resume their fetal hematopoietic role in certain pathologic conditions and is called extramedullary hematopoiesis.",A

Peyronie disease results from subcutaneous fibrosis of the dorsum of the penis. Phimosis is an abnormally tight foreskin that is difficult or impossible to retract over the glans penis.",D
True about Apoptosis are all except :,>Inflammation is present,>Chromosomal brekage,>Clumping of chromatin,>Cell shrinkage,"inflammation is present [Ref. Robbins 7th/e p 31, 271 At early stage of apoptosis dying cells secrete soluble factors that recruit phagocytes. Apoptotic cells express phosplzatidylserine in the outer layers of their plasma membrane. Some times thrombospondin is also expressed on the surface of apoptotic bodies. These alterations permit the early recognition of dead cells by the macrophages, resulting in phagocytosis without the release of proinflammatory cellular components. In this way apoptotic response disposes of cells with minimal compromise to the surrounding tissue. The process of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is so efficient that dead cells disappear without leaving a trace and inflammation is viually absent. Thus apoptosis is fundamentally different from necrosis which is characterized by loss of membrane integrity enzymatic digestion of cells and frequently a host reaction. In case of apoptosis, the cell membrane remains intact. The two most striking features of apoptosis are: 1.1n contrast to necrosis it does not elicit inflammation 2. Considerable apoptosis may occur in tissues before it becomes apparent in histological section (because it occurs very rapidly). Morphological changes in apoptosis 1. Cell shrinkage This is the earliest change. It is due to damage of cytoskeletal proteins that provide structural suppo to the cell. 2. Chromatic Condensation (Pyknosis) This is due to breakdown and clumping of chromatin. This is most characteristic feature of apoptosis 3.Formation of cytoplasimic blebs and apoptotic bodies ---> End stage is characterised by bleb formation. 4. Chromosomal DNA fragmentation It is due to activity of endoneuclease and caspases. 5.Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and bodies by adjacent macrophages or healthy parenchymal cells.

Cell-mediated immunity is-,Type I,Type II,Type III,Type IV,"Cell-mediated (Type) hypersensitivity

It is initiated by activated T-lymphocytes.

It includes
1. Delayed-type hypersensitivity - mediated by CD-4 T cells.
2. T-cell mediated cytotoxicity - mediated by CDS- T cells.
1. Delayed-type hypersensitivity

In delayed hypersensitivity reactions, CD-4 T cells and macrophages are primarily involved.
The term delayed is used to differentiate it from a secondary' cellular response, which appears at 48-72 hours after antigen exposure and from an immediate hypersensitivity response, which generally appears within minutes,
Delayed hypersensitivity is a major mechanism of defence against various intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria, fungi and certain parasites.

Pathophysiology

Delayed hypersensitivity is characterized by the formation of granuloma - a localized mass that contains activated macrophages (epithelioid) cells surrounded by colour of lymphocytes and giant cells.
It is also called granulomatous Inflammation.
The cellular events start when an antigen (eg tuberculin antigen) on antigen presenting cell comes in contact with naive CD-4 T cells → naive CD-4 T cells recognize this peptide antigen in association with MHC – II and differentiate into T4-l cells.
Induction of T4-l cells is of central importance because the expression of delayed hypersensitivity largely depends on the cytokines secreted by T4-l cells.

2. T-cell mediated cytotoxicity

In this type of hypersensitivity, cytotoxic T cells kill virus-infected or tumor cells.",D

Raised serum level of lipoprotein-a is a predictor of,Cirrhosis of liver,Rheumatic arthritis,Atherosclerosis,Cervical cancer,"Lipoprotein - (a)

Lp (a) is a lipoprotein similar to LDL in lipid and protein composition, but it contains an additional protein called apolipoprotein (a).
An elevated level of Lp (a) is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis.
How does Lp (a) increase the risk of atherosclerosis?
In atherosclerosis, there is hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis due to associated inflammation (remind you-atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition).
So there is consistent deposition of fibrin.
Lp (a) has close homology to plasminogen and it competes with plasminogen for binding on the surface of endothelium. This result in the reduced generation of plasmin from plasminogen → Inhibition of endogenous fibrinolytic system.
This enhances further fibrin deposition.
In addition, Lp (a) is accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions.
So, Lp (a) causes impaired cell surface fibrinolysis and progressive atherosclerosis.",C

All of the following is involved in tumor metastasis cascade except -,Fibronectin,e-cadherin,Type IV collagenase,Tyrosine kinase,"Invasion and metastasis of tumor 

Invasion and metastasis are biological hallmarks of malignant tumors.
This involve a series of steps -

​Detachment of tumor cells


Detachment of tumor cells is the first step in metastasis.
Normally cells are glued to each other by adhesion molecules E-cadherin.
Normal function of E-cadherin is dependent on catenins that helps in linkage of cytoskeleton to E-cadherin.
Down regulation of expression of either E-cadherins or catenins results loosening of cells that helps in metastasis.

 Attachment to ECM (including basement membrane)

Tumor cells express integrins that helps in the attachement of cells to many components of ECM like fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and collegen.

Degradation of ECM

After attachement to ECM components, tumor cells must create passageways for migration.
This require enzymatic degradation of ECM.
Tumor cells secrete proteolytic enzymes themselves or stimulate macrophages and fibroblasts to secrete these enzymes.
The most important proteases are metalloproteinases (MMPs) including collagenase IV.

Vascular dissemination and homing of tumor cells

After travelling through ECM, tumor cells enter into the vessels.
In the vessels, tumor cells tend to aggregate in clumps.
This is due to adhesion between tumor cells and blood cells, particularly platelets.
This clump is carried away at distant site where it adhere to endothelium, followed by extravasation from the vessels.
Adhesion to endothelium and further travelling through ECM require same mechanism, as was required initially for attachement and degradation of ECM.
At new site, tumor cells proliferate and develops new blood supply → metastatic secondary tumor mass.
Note → Among adhesion molecule CD44 is of particular interest, which is expressed on normal T-cells and is used by these cells to migrate to selective sites in lymphoid tissue.

Impoant difference between leuprolide and ganirelix is that ganirelix,Can be given orally,Immediately reduces gonadotropin secretion,Must be given in a pulsatile fashion,Initially stimulates release of LH and FSH,"Superactive / long-acting GnRH agonists Many analogues of GnRH, e.g. Goserelin, Leuprolide,Nafarelin, Triptorelin, have longer action (t 1/2 2-6 hours) because of high affinity for GnRH receptor and resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis. Because physiological release of GnRH is in pulses, whereas these agonists act continuously; they only initially increase Gn secretion. After 1-2 weeks they cause desensitization and down regulation of GnRH receptors ->inhibition of FSH and LH secretion -> suppression of gonadal function. GnRH antagonists:- Some more extensively substituted GnRH analogues act as GnRH receptor antagonists. They inhibit Gn secretion without causing initial stimulation. The early GnRH antagonists(Leuprolide, gosereline etc.)had the limitation of producing reactions due to histamine release. Later agents like ganirelix and cetrorelix have low histamine releasing potential and are being clinically used. Ref :- kd tripathi; pg num:-242,243",B

"A 14 year old boy complains with gingival bleeding, oral ulcers, anemia with hepatomegaly but no lymphadenopathy, total leukocyte count of one lakh cells per mm3 is suffering from:",Acute myeloid leukemia,Chronic monocytic leukemia,Chronic lymphoblastic leukemia,Chronic myeloid leukemia,"Oral and periodontal manifestations of leukemia may include leukemic infiltration, bleeding, oral ulcerations, and infections. The expression of these signs is more common with acute and subacute forms of leukemia than with chronic forms.
Leukemic cells can infiltrate the gingiva and, less frequently, the alveolar bone. Gingival infiltration often results in leukemic gingival enlargement leukemia. Highest incidence is seen in patients with acute monocytic leukemia (66.7%), followed by those with acute myelocytic–monocytic leukemia (18.7%) and acute myelocytic leukemia (3.7%). It should be noted, however, that monocytic leukemia is an extremely rare form of the disease. Leukemic gingival enlargement is not found in edentulous patients or in patients with chronic leukemia, suggesting that it represents the accumulation of immature leukemic blast cells in the gingiva adjacent to tooth surfaces with bacterial plaque.

"An oval lesion is found in the right lobe of the liver in an otherwise asymptomatic 24-year-old female. Surgical resection finds a single welldemarcated lesion that has a prominent, central, stellate white scar. This gross appearance is most consistent with a diagnosis of",Metastatic adenocarcinoma,Focal nodular hyperplasia,Hemangioma,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"Neoplasms of the liver, either benign or malignant, have characteristic microscopic or gross appearances. Benign tumors of the liver include hemangiomas (the most common), focal nodular hyperplasias, nodular regenerative hyperplasias, and adenomas. Hemangiomas are characterized by numerous small endotheliallined spaces filled with blood. The lack of erythrocytes or blood would raise the possibility of the lesion being a lymphangioma, while pleomorphic or atypical endothelial cells would suggest the possibility of an angiosarcoma. Focal nodular hyperplasia, which has a characteristic gross appearance of a central stellate scar within the tumor, microscopically reveals hepatic nodules surrounded by fibrous bands having numerous proliferating bile ducts. This type of tumor is related to bih-control pills, but has no association with malignancy. In contrast, nodular regenerative hyperplasia involves the entire liver and forms multiple spherical nodules. Histologic sections reveal plump hepatocytes surrounded by rims of atrophic cells. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia is clinically impoant because it is associated with the subsequent development of poal hypeension. Two types of hepatic adenomas are the liver cell adenoma and the bile duct adenoma. Liver cell adenomas are seen in female patients taking bih-control pills.

A: AtrophyThe lipofuscin pigment may impa a brownish discoloration to tissues when present in sufficient amounts (atrophy).Lipofuscin is an insoluble pigment which represents the indigestible residue of autophagic vacuoles within cells formed during aging or atrophy.The following is the manner in which lipofuscin is formed:'During atrophy and aging, degenerating cellular organelles are enclosed in autophagic vacuoles.Subsequently, lysosomes discharge their hydrolytic enzymes into these membrane bounded vacuoles and the cellular organelles are digested by autophagy.However, some of the organelle components may resist digestion or be incompletely digested.

DIC is caused by the systemic activation of coagulation and results in the for- mation of thrombi throughout the microcirculation. As a conse- quence, platelets and coagulation factors are consumed and, secondarily, fibrinolysis is activated. Thus, DIC can give rise to either tissue hypoxia and microinfarcts caused by myriad microthrombi or to a bleeding disorder related to patho- logic activation of fibrinolysis and the depletion of the ele- ments required for hemostasis (hence the term consumptive coagulopathy).

There is a 7-cm pulsating mass in the midline of the lower abdomen. Laboratory studies include two fasting serum glucose measurements of 170 mg/dL and 200 mg/dL. Which of the following vascular lesions is most likely to be present in this patient?",Aortic dissection,Arteriovenous fistula,Atherosclerotic aneurysm,Polyarteritis nodosa,"Abdominal aneurysms are most often related to underlying aortic atherosclerosis. This patient has multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and smoking. When the aneurysm reaches this size, there is a significant risk of rupture. An aortic dissection is typically a sudden, life-threatening event with dissection of blood out of the ascending aortic lumen, typically into the chest, without a pulsatile abdominal mass. The risk factors for atherosclerosis and hypertension also underlie aortic dissection. An arteriovenous fistula can produce an audible bruit on auscultation. Classic polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) can produce small microaneurysms in small arteries, most often renal and mesenteric. Takayasu arteritis typically involves the aortic arch and branches in children.

Most impoant dose-limiting toxicity of cancer chemotherapy is:,Gastrointestinal toxicity,Neurotoxicity,Bone marrow suppression,Nephrotoxicity,"G E N ERAL TOXICITY OF CYTOTOXIC DRUGS Majority of the cytotoxic drugs have more profound effect on rapidly multiplying cells, because the most impoant target of action are the nucleic acids and their precursors; rapid nucleic acid synthesis occurs during cell division. Many cancers (especially large solid tumours) have a lower growth fraction (lower percentage of cells are in division) than normal bone marrow, epithelial linings, reticuloendothelial (RE) system and gonads. These tissues are paicularly affected in a dose-dependent manner by majority of drugs; though, there are differences in susceptibility to individual members. 1 . Bone marrow Depression of bone marrow results in granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anaemia. This is the most serious toxicity; often limits the dose that can be employed. Infections and bleeding are the usual complications. 2. Lymphoreticular tissue Lymphocytopenia and inhibition of lymphocyte function results in suppression of cell mediated as well as humoral immunity. Because of action (1) and (2) + damage to epithelial surfaces, the host defence mechanisms (specific as well as nonspecific) are broken down",C

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Celiac sprue,Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas,Menetrier disease,Tropical sprue,"Celiac sprue, which is also referred to as gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is characterized by (1) generalized malabsorption, (2) small intestinal mucosal lesions, and (3) prompt clinical and histopathologic response to the withdrawal of gluten-containing food. Critical factors in the development of celiac sprue include genetic predisposition and gliadin exposure. The hallmark of celiac disease is a flat mucosa, with blunting of villi, damaged epithelial cells, intra-epithelial T cells, and increased plasma cells in the lamina propria. The other choices do not respond to a gluten-free diet.Diagnosis: Celiac sprue",A
Hypocalcemia is seen with which of the following: September 2008,Thyrotoxicosis,Hyperparathyroidism,Acute pancreatitis,Addison disease,"Ans. C: Acute pancreatitis Hypoalbuminemia is the most common cause of hypocalcemia and is due to cirrhosis, nephrosis, malnutrition, burns, chronic illness, and sepsis. Hypomagnesemia causes end-organ resistance to PTH and inhibits the hypocalcemic feedback loop through unceain mechanisms. Causes of hypomagnesemia include pancreatitis, aminoglycoside treatment, amphotericin B, loop diuretics, alcoholism, and malnutrition. Hyperphosphatemia may be seen in critical illness and in patients who have ingested phosphate-containing enemas. Phosphate binds calcium avidly, causing acute hypocalcemia. Multifactorial causes are probably the most clinically relevant hypocalcemic emergencies include the following: - Acute pancreatitis: Free fatty acids chelate calcium, causing saponification in the retroperitoneum. - Rhabdomyolysis: Increased phosphates from creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and other anions (i.e., lactate, bicarbonate) chelate calcium. - Sepsis can cause hypocalcemia through many mechanisms. - Toxic shock syndrome can cause hypocalcemia. High calcitonin levels cause low calcium. - Malignancy: Osteoblastic metastases (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer) and tumor lysis syndrome may cause hypocalcemia (by differing mechanisms). - Hepatic or renal insufficiency: Calciuresis, hypomagnesemia, hypoalbuminemia, and low active vitamin D levels may contribute to poor calcium homeostasis. - Infiltrative disease: Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and hemochromatosis may infiltrate the parathyroids, causing dysfunction. -- Toxicologic causes include hydrofluoric acid burn or ingestion. Enhanced protein binding and anion chelation - Protein binding is enhanced by elevated pH and free fatty acid release in high catecholamine states. Anion chelation is seen in high phosphate states (e.g., renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, mesenteric ischemia, oral administration of phosphate-containing enemas); high citrate states (e.g., massive blood transfusion, radiocontrast dyes); and high bicarbonate, lactate, and oxalate levels. Medication effects - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production resulting in reduced calcium absorption. - Selective serotonin inhibitors can have a calcium antagonistic effect on smooth muscle, paicularly vascular endothelium. - Calcitonin and bisphosphonates cause chelation and end-organ inhibition. - Phenobarbital and phenytoin enhance vitamin D catabolism and decrease calcium resorption in the gut. Foscarnet complexes with calcium. Fluoride, paicularly hydrofluoric acid, chelates calcium avidly and causes profound hypocalcemia. Ethylene glycol complexes with calcium. Estrogen inhibits bone resorption. Cimetidine decreases gastric pH, slowing fat breakdown, which is necessary to complex calcium for gut absorption. Aluminum and alcohol suppress PTH. Gadolinium-based contrast material can falsely lower serum calcium levels and should be considered if levels are drawn sholy after magnetic resonance imaging. Postsurgical effects Parathyroid adenoma resection causes a transient hypocalcemia due to end-organ PTH resistance in the first postoperative day. Pancreatectomy prevents calcium absorption in the duodenum and the jejunum by eliminating necessary enzymes. Small bowel syndrome causes hypocalcemia by reducing the surface available to absorb fatty acids and calcium. PTH deficiency/resistance Infiltrative diseases include Wilson disease and metastatic cancer. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is due to PTH resistance and has many forms, most notably Albright disease. Renal failure can result in a variety of endocrine disorders, occasionally including hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency/resistance - Rickets may be due to lack of vitamin D or end-organ receptor resistance. - Hepatorenal disease: The liver and the kidney provide intermediary enzymes to form active 1,25 (OH)2 D.",C

The cause of oedema in Nephritic syndrome is-,Decreased in plasma protein concentration,Increased in plasma protein concentration,Reduced plasma osmotic pressure,Sodium and water retention,"there is a derangement in the capillary walls of the glomeruli that result in increased permeability to plasma proteins. Any increased permeability resulting from either structural or physicochemical alterations in the GBM allows proteins to escape from the plasma into the glomerular filtrate.With long-standing or extremely heavy proteinuria, serum albumin is decreased, resulting in hypoalbuminemia and adrop in plasma colloid osmotic pressure. Which results in a decrease of intravascular volume and renal blood flow triggers increased release of renin from renal juxtaglomerular cells. Renin, in turn, stimulates the angiotensin-aldosterone axis, which promotes the retention of salt and water by the kidney. This tendency is exacerbated by reductions in the cardiac secretion of natriuretic factors. In the face of continuing proteinuria, thesealterations fuher aggravate the edema.

Why is it so? lets see : ? The NK cells express activating and inhibiting receptors. The functional activity of the NK cells is regulated by a balance between signal from these receptors. MHC class I molecules has inhibiting signal on NK cells and normal cell are not killed because inhibiting signals from normal MHC class I molecules overside activating signals. The ability of NK cells to kill target cells is inversly related to target cell expression of MHC class I molecule. If virus infection or neoplastic transformation reduces the expression of MHC I, inhibitory signals are interrupted and lysis of target cells occur. 3.

True statement about inheritence of an X linked recessive trait is,50% of boys of carrier mother are affected,50% of girls of diseased father are carrier,Father transmits disease to the son,Mother transmits the disease to the daughter,"X-linked recessive and are characterized by the following features: They are transmitted by heterozygous female carriers only to sons, who of course are hemizygous for the X chromosome. Heterozygous females rarely express the full phenotypic change, because they have the paired normal allele; although one of the X chromosomes in females is inactivated, this process of inactivation is random, which typically allows sufficient numbers of cells with the normal expressed allele to emerge. An affected male does not transmit the disorder to sons, but all daughters are carriers. Sons of heterozygous women have one chance in two of receiving the mutant gene.

This cluster includes ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and enteropathic arthritis (as in this case). A common feature is a very strong association with the HLA-B27 genotype. Despite some similarities with rheumatoid arthritis, these patients invariably have a negative test result for rheumatoid factor. Urethritis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis can trigger reactive arthritis, another form of seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Such infection precedes the onset of arthritis, however.

Nicotinic acid ?,Increases HDL,Increased triglyceride synthesis,Type II hyperlipoproteinemia,Decreased hydrolysis of VLDL,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Increases HDL Nicotinic acid (Niacin) There arc three main type of lipases related to metabolism of lipoproteins ? Lipoprotein lipase - Present in blood vessels and causes hydrolysis of tryglyceride content of VLDL and chylomicrones. Hepatic lipase - Conves IDL to LDL by hydrolysing the triglyceride content of IDL. Hormone sensitive lipase - Present intracellularly in peripheral tissue and causes intracellular lipolysis by hydrolysing triglycerides. Niacin (Nicotinic acid) inhibits intracellular lipolysis by inhibiting hormone sensitive lipase - intracellular FFA to liver - 4 .1, triglyceride synthesis. Niacin also increases the activity of lipoprotein lipase - T hydrolysis of VLDL triglyceride. Nicotinic acid also reduces the production of VLDL in liver by inhibiting TG-synthesis - indirectly the VLDL degradation products IDL and LDL are also reduced. Nicotinic acid is the most effective drug to raise HDL-CH. Increased HDL is due to interference of direct pathway of HDL cholesterol to liver which involves apo-Ai - Niacin decreases apo- A, mediated hepatic clearance.

Feature (s) of DiGeorge syndrome is/are all except:,Results from failure of development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches,Absent thyroid,Absent parathyroid glands,B cell defect,"D. B cell defectDiGeorge Syndrome {Thymic Hypoplasia) Robbins 9th/24lDiGeorge syndrome is a T-cell deficiency that results from failure of development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. The latter give rise to the thymus, the parathyroids, some of the C cells of the thyroid, and the ultimobranchial body. Thus, individuals with this syndrome have a variable loss of T cell-mediated immunity (resulting from hypoplasia or lack of the thymus), tetany (resulting from lack of the parathyroids), and congenital defects of the heart and great vessels.Absence of cell-mediated immunity is caused by low numbers of T lymphocytes in the blood and lymphoid tissues and poor defense against certain fungal and viral infections.The T-cell zones of lymphoid organs--paracortical areas of the lymph nodes and the periarteriolar sheaths of the spleen--are depleted. Ig levels may be normal or reduced, depending on the severity of the T-cell deficiency.'Patients who survives the neonatal period show enhanced susceptibility to viral, fungal and bacterial infections, which ultimately prove fatal'- Ananthanarayan 10th/175Patients with DGS may have poor T-cell production compared to their peers, and as a result, have an increased susceptibility to viral, fungal and bacterial infections- primaryimmune.orgDiGeorge Syndrome Harrison I9th/2483A form of hypoparathyroidism associated with defective development of both the thymus and the parathyroid glands is termed the DiGeorge syndrome, or the velocardiofacial syndrome.Congenital cardiovascular, facial, and other developmental defects are present, and patients may die in early childhood with severe infections, hypocalcemia and seizures, or cardiovascular complications.Most cases are sporadic, but an autosomal dominant form involving microdeletions of chromosome 22q11.2 has been described.",D

Increased level of calcium in the cytosol activates endogenous phospholipases from ischaemic tissue which degrade membrane phospholipids progressively which are the main constituent of the lipid bilayer membrane. An alternate hypothesis is decreased replacement-synthesis of membrane phospholipids due to reduced ATP.

All are true of benzodiazepines except:,Benzodiazepam is used in treatment of status epilepticus,Benzodiazepam is used in the long term treatment of psychic disorders,Clonazepam is used in the treatment of petitmal epilepsy,None of the above,"Benzodiazepines are effective for the treatment of anxiety symptoms secondary to panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, performance anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and extreme anxiety associated with phobias, such as fear of flying. ​
The benzodiazepines are also useful in treating anxiety related to depression and schizophrenia. 
Clonazepam is occasionally used as adjunctive therapy for certain types of seizures, whereas lorazepam and diazepam are the drugs of choice in terminating status epilepticus. Due to cross-tolerance, chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam, and oxazepam are useful in the acute treatment of alcohol withdrawal and reduce the risk of withdrawal-related seizures.​
One area of concern regarding the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety is the potential for habituation, dependence, and abuse. Patients with certain personality disorders or a history of drug or alcohol abuse are particularly susceptible. However, the risk of dependence must be balanced with the need for treatment, since benzodiazepines are effective in both short- and long-term treatment of patients with sustained or recurring bouts of anxiety. Further, premature discontinuation of benzodiazepines, in the absence of other pharmacological treatment, results in a high rate of relapse. Withdrawal of benzodiazepines after chronic treatment, particularly those with short duration of action, can include increased anxiety and seizures. For this reason, it is important that discontinuation be earned out in a gradual manner.
Benzodiazepines cause many adverse effects. including sedation, mild memory impairments. decreased alertness, and slowed reaction time (which may lead to accidents). Memory problems can include visual-spatial deficits, but will manifest clinically in a variety of ways, including difficulty in word-finding. Occasionally, paradoxical reactions can occur with benzodiazepines such as an increase
in anxiety, sometimes reaching panic attack proportions. Other pathological reactions can include irritability, aggression, or behavioral disinhibition. Amnesic reactions (i.e., loss of memory for particular periods) can also occur. Benzodiazepines should not be used in pregnant women; there have been rare reports of craniofacial defects. In addition, benzodiazepines taken prior to delivery may result in sedated, under-responsive newborns and prolonged withdrawal reactions. In the elderly, benzodiazepines increase the risk of falls and must be used cautiously. These drugs are safer than classical sedative-hypnotics in overdosage and typically are fatal only if combined with other CNS depressants.

"A patient with Hb-6 gm%, TLC 1200, platelet-60,000, MCV-12 fl, what is the diagnosis?",Aplastic anemia,Megaloblastic anemia,PNH,Myelofibrosis,"The ﬁndings in the given question are: Anemia (Hb = 6 gm%), Reduced leukocyte count (TLC=1200), Reduced platelet count (60000), Reduced MCV (12 fL).
Normal value of MCV is 80-100 fL. It is the measure of size of RBC. Reduced MCV means microcytic and increased MCV means macrocytic RBCs. Normal TLC is 4000-11000, normal platelet count is 1,50,000 to 4,50,000 and normal Hb is above 12 g/dL.
Now, considering the options one by one:

Aplastic anemia has reduced RBC, WBC as well as platelet counts. Anemia is normocytic normochromic, thus it can be easily ruled out.
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) typically presents with anemia which is usually normocytic normochromic.

If MCV is high, it is due to reticulocytosis. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may or may not be present.
Therefore, this option also cannot be the answer.

Megaloblastic anemia presents with raised MCV. There may be leukopenia as well as thrombocytopenia. Severity of these changes parallels the degree of anemia.
Myeloﬁbrosis usually presents with anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Mostly anemia is normocytic but in 30% cases, microcytic anemia can be present.

Based on the above discussion, the most probable answer is ‘Myeloﬁbrosis’.
However, the value of MCV given is 12 fL which is practically not possible. Normal value of MCV is 80- 100 fL. MCV < 50 fL is considered to be extremely low. Therefore, one possibility is that it may be 112 fL and due to typographical error in the question, written as 12 fL. If this is the case, then the answer will become megaloblastic anemia.",D

Which of the following growth alteration is an example of hyperplasia rather than metaplasia?,Increased gobbler cells in the mainstem bronchus of a smoker,Squamous epithelium in the bladder of a patient with Schistosoma haematobium,Distal esophagus with glandular epithelium intermixed with squamous epithelium,Goblet and Paneth cells in the glands of the gastric mucosa,"Hyperplasia is an increase in cell number, whereas metaplasia is the replacement of one adult cell type by another adult cell type. Hyperplasia occurs when there is increased trophic stimulation (e.g., hormones, growth factors), increased functional demand, or persistent cell injury. Only labile and stable cells undergo hyperplasia; labile cells have stern cells that frequently divide, and stable cells have resting cells that are stimulated to enter the cell cycle. The presence of increased goblet cells in the mainstem bronchus of a smoker is an example of hyperplasia, because goblet cells are normally present in this area. However, their presence in the terminal bronchiole or gastric mucosa, where they are not normally found, is an example of metaplasia. Squamous epithelium in the bladder of a patient with Schistosoma haernatobium is an example of metaplasia, because the epithelium of a normal bladder is transitional. Irritation from the eggs of the schistosomes induces squamous metaplasia and the potential for dysplasia and squamous carcinoma. A distal esophagus with glandular epithelium intermixed with squamous epithelium is an example of Barrett esophagus. Chronic acid injury to the distal esophagus from gastroesophageal reflux stimulates the formation of mucoussecreting glandular epithelium, which is a type of glandular metaplasia and predisposes the patient to adenocarcinoma. Goblet and Paneth cells in the glands of the gastric mucosa is called intestinal metaplasia and is commonly seen in chronic atrophic gastritis of the body and fundus (type A) or pylorus and antrum (type B). It is a precursor lesion of adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Squamous epithelium in the mains tern bronchus of a smoker is squamous metaplasia, because normal epithelium is pseudostratifiecl, ciliated, and columnar. The squamous epithelium is a reaction to injury induced by cigarette smoke. It predisposes the patient to squamous dysplasia and carcinoma.",A

This patient's condition has been most frequently associated with which of the following?,Arnold-Chiari malformation,Broca's aphasia,Horner's syndrome,Tabes dorsalis,"The patient most probably has syringomyelia, in which softening and cavitation around the central canal of the spinal cord damages crossing fibers of the spinothalamic tract with resulting bilateral loss of pain and temperature (but not touch) sensation in the upper extremities. Many of the patients with syringomyelia have Arnold-Chiari malformation, in which there is a congenital protrusion of the cerebellum and medulla through the foramen magnum. Broca's aphasia is a nonfluent aphasia due to damage to the inferior frontal gyrus. Horner's syndrome is due to damage to the sympathetic innervation of the face, with resulting ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. Tabes dorsalis is a degeneration of the dorsal columns and dorsal roots of the spinal cord due to teiary syphilis, producing impaired proprioception and locomotor ataxia.

Which virus is implicated in Burkitts lymphoma?,HTLV,HPV,EBV,HHV8,"Explanation: BURKITT LYMPHOMA There are three clinical types:
1. African (endemic) Burkitt lymphoma.
2. Sporadic (nonendemic) Burkitt lymphoma.
3. Aggressive lymphomas associated with HIV.
These 3 types are histologically identical. Morphology The tumor exhibits a high mitotic index and contains numerous apoptotic cells,
the nuclear remnants of which are phagocytosed by interspersed benign macrophages.
These phagocytes have abundant clear cytoplasm, creating a characteristic “starry sky” pattern. Immunophenotype These are tumors of mature B cells.
It express surface IgM, CD 19, CD20, CD 10 and BCL6. a phenotype consistent with a germinal center B-cell origin.
Unlike other tumors of germinal center origin, this does not express anti-apoptotic protein BCL2.
Molecular Pathogenesis All forms of Burkin lymphoma are associated with translocations of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8.
The translocation partner is usually the IgH locus  light-chain loci.
All endemic tumors are latently infected with EBV. which is also present in about 25% of HIVassociated tumors and 15% to 20% of sporadic cases.
Clinical Features Endemic Burkitt lymphoma often presents as a mass involving the mandible and shows an unusual predilection for involvement of abdominal viscera,
particularly the kidneys, ovaries and adrenal glands. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma most often appears as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum.
Burkitt lymphoma is very aggressive but responds well to intensive chemotherapy",C

Origin of pindborg tumour is:,Reduced enamel epithelium,Stratum intermedium,Dental lamina,All of the above,"The Pindborg tumor is classified as an uncommon, benign, odontogenic neoplasm that is exclusively epithelial in origin. Some have suggested that the epithelial cells of the Pindborg tumor are reminiscent of the cells in the stratum intermedium layer of the enamel organ in tooth development. Some hypothesize that the Pindborg tumor arises from remnants of the primitive dental lamina found in the initial stage of odontogenesis, and these epithelial rests are the more likely true progenitor cell. The definite etiology of this neoplasm still remains enigmatic.
Key concept: 
The tumor cells bear a close morphologic resemblance to the cells of the stratum intermedium of the enamel organ; however, some investigators have recently suggested that the tumor arises from dental lamina remnants based on its anatomic distribution in the jaws.

Which of the following is not metabolized by acetylation:,Hydralazine,Phenytoin,Isoniazid,Procainamide,"Ans. B: Phenytoin Phenytoin is extensively metabolised in the liver to 5-(4-hydroxypheny1)-5 phenyl-hydantoin, which is inactive. This para hydroxylation of phenytoin is carried out by cytochrome P450 2C9. This enzyme also hydroxylates tolbutamide and warfarin. This explains the interaction with these substances. The p-hydroxylated phenytoin is in turn conjugated to its glucuronide. Phenytoin hydroxylation is capacity-limited because of the saturable enzyme systems in the liver. At therapeutic doses, metabolism is nonlinear (first-order kinetics), while at toxic doses the metabolism is linear zero-order kinetics). Phenytoin undergoes entero-hepatic recycling.",B
"At usual therapeutic doses (blood levels), expected effects of aspirin include which of the following?",Efficacy greater than acetaminophen as an anti-inflammatory agent,Efficacy less than acetaminophen for relieving simple headache pain,"Inhibited growth, or killing, of bacteria that cause fever as a symptom of infection","Inhibition of leukotriene synthesis, protection against bronchopasm in asthmatics","Aspirin inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins that are impoant in the pathophysiology, signs, and symptoms of a host of inflammatory or ahritic states. It does so, of course, by inhibiting both COX-I and -2. Acetaminophen lacks this propey, and so acetaminophen is much less efficacious for managing inflammation. Aspirin and acetaminophen are equally efficacious (and, for all practical purposes, equipotent) for relieving the simple headache for most patients. (Note, however, when pain involves a component of inflammation, aspirin is clearly superior to acetaminophen because it suppresses both the inflammation and the pain caused by it.) Aspirin usually helps normalize or lower body temperature in febrile states, but this, too, involves inhibited synthesis of prostaglandins (peripherally perhaps, leading to increased heat loss through diaphoresis, but also in such central structures as the hypothalamus, which is a prime temperature regulating structure). Aspirin does not exe bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects (at any level encountered in vivo), and so antibiotic effects do not contribute to its antipyretic actions. Although aspirin is an effective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, it has no effects on the lipoxygenase pathway that leads to leukotriene synthesis. It does not affect uric acid synthesis (xanthine oxidase) at all. Ref: KD Tripathi 8th ed.",A

Absolute contraindications for fibrinolytic therapy are?,Prior intracranial hemorrhage,Ischemic stroke within 3 months,Suspected aortic dissection,All of above,"Ans. D. All of abovea. The major toxicity of all thrombolytic agents is hemorrhage, which results from two factors: 1) the lysis of fibrin in hemostatic plugs at sites of vascular injury, and 2) the systemic lytic state that results from systemic plasmin generation, which produces fibrinogenolysis and degradation of other coagulation factors (especially factors V and VIII).b.

Warfarin effect may be enhanced by: March 2005,Phenobarbitone,Ketoconazole,Rifampicin,Chronic alcoholism,"Ans. D: Chronic Alcoholism Many commonly-used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase the effect of warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce the amount of the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hypehyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Liver diseases, chronic alcoholism may enhance effect as synthesis of clotting factor may be deficient.",D

Metoclopramide has the following actions EXCEPT:,Increase lower esophageal sphincter tone,Prokinetic action is blocked by atropine,Increase gastric peristalsis,Increase large intestinal peristalsis,"(Ref: KDT 6/e p643) Metoclopramide is a prokinetic and anti-emetic drug. It acts by blocking D2 and 5-HT3 receptors and stimulating 5-HT4 receptors. D2 receptors are normally inhibitory to the release of ACh. Metoclopramide enhances ACh release by blocking these inhibitory D2 receptors. Due to increased release of ACh, there is increase in gastric motility and LES tone. Prokinetic action can thus be blocked by atropine. Metoclopramide has no effect on colonic motility.",D

Classic HUS is seen in children and is related to infection, usually acquired from contaminated ground meat, by verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli. This toxin is similar to Shigella toxins, which, together with E. coli and viruses, are causes of the adult form of HUS. Multiple microthrombi in glomerular capillaries result in renal failure, while systemically the microthrombi cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Subsequently thrombocytopenia develops and leads to a bleeding diathesis, seen as vomiting of blood and hematuria. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is separated from these two thrombotic microangiopathic syndromes by its excessive activation of the clotting system, which results in increased fibrin degradation products (FDP or FSP) and prolonged clotting times (PT and PTT) due to depletion of coagulation factors.

Variation in sensitivity of response to increasing doses of the drug in different individuals can be obtained from,Graded DRC,Quantal DRC,Potency,Efficacy,"Quantal DRC When the response is an 'all or none' phenomenon (e.g. antiemetic drug stopping the vomiting or not), the y-axis (response axis) shows the number of person responding and X-axis shows the plasma concentration. It thus shows that how many person respond to a paicular dose of the drug. It is used to calculate ED50 and LD50. Median Effective Dose (ED50): It is the dose that will produce the desired response in half of the (50%)recipients. More is ED50, lower is the potency and vice a versa. Median Lethal Dose (LD50): It is the dose that will result in death of 50% of the animals receiving the drug. More is LD50, safer is the drug. Therapeutic Index (T.I.): It is a measure of the safety of a drug. It is calculated as a ratio of LD50 to ED50.

Factors affecting sickling in sickle cell anemia are?,HbS concentration,HbA,pH,All,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., HbS concentration; 'b' i.e., HbA; 'c' i.e., pH Factors affecting sickling Amount of HbS and interaction with other hemoglobins. o Most impoant factor for sickling is the amount of HbS and its interaction with other types of hemoglobin. o In homozygous individuals, all the hemoglobin in red blood cell is HbS, and undergo sickling. o In heterozygous, only 40% of hemoglobin is HbS --> Sickling does not occur because HbA (remaining 60% of normal hemoglobin) has an inhibitory effect on polymerization of HbS. o Fetal hemoglobin HbF also has inhibitory effect on sickling of HbS ----> Newborns do not manifest the disease until they are 5 to 6 months of age, when the amount of HbF in the cells falls close to the adult level. o HbC has a greater tendency to copolymerize with deoxygenated HbS. 2. Hemoglobin concentration o The rate of HbS polymerization is strongly dependent upon the hemologbin concentration per cell i.e., MCHC. o Higher HbS concentration increase the probability that aggregation and polymerization will occur during any given period of time. o Thus, intracellular dehydration, which increases the MCHC, faciliatates sickling. o Conversly, conditions that decrease MCHC reduce disease severity e.g., when sickle cell anemia occurs with athalassemia 3. Deoxygenation with HbS o Polymerization of HbS occurs only in deoxygenated state. o A decrease in pH reduces the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, thereby increasing the fraction of deoxygenated HbS at any given oxygen tension and augmenting the tendency of sickling. 4. The length of time red cell are exposed to low oxygen tension. o Normal transient times for red cells passing through capillaries are not sufficient for significant aggregation of deoxygenated HbS to occurs. o Hence, sickling of red cells is confined to microvascular beds where blood flow is sluggish. o This is normally the case in spleen and bone marrow which are predominantly affected by sickle cell disease.",D
Gene or protein deficient in marfan's syndrome?,Fibrillin I,Fibrillin II,Collagen,Elastin,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Fibrillin I Marfan syndrome :? Marfan syndrome results from inherited defect in an extracellular glycoprotein fibrillin -1 on chromosome - 15. It has autosomal dominant inheritance. Pathogenesis Defect in fibrillin affects the elastic recoil of extracellular connective tissue. Elastic fibres consist of a central core made up of elastin, surronded by a peripheral network of microfibrils that consists largely fibrillin. Defect in fibrillin causes defective function of elastic fibres. Microfibrils (containing fibrillin) are mainly distributed to Aoa, ligaments of joint and ciliary zolules of lens - So, in marfan syndrome these tissues are primarily affected.",A

"Two days after receiving the antimalarial drug primaquine, a 27-yearold black man develops sudden intravascular hemolysis resulting in a decreased hematocrit, hemoglobinemia, and hemoglobinuria. Examination of the peripheral blood film is given. The most likely diagnosis is",Hereditary spherocytosis,Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia,"Examination of the peripheral blood reveals erythrocytes with a membrane defect forming 'bite' cells; when crystal violet stain is applied, many Heinz bodies are seen. Glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme of the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway that maintains glutathione in a reduced (active) form. Glutathione normally protects hemoglobin from oxidative injury. If the erythrocytes are deficient in G6PD, as occurs in G6PD deficiency, exposure to oxidant drugs, such as the antimalarial drug primaquine, denatures hemoglobin, which then precipitates with erythrocytes as Heinz bodies. Macrophages within the spleen remove these bodies, producing characteristic 'bite' cells. These red cells then become less deformable and are trapped and destroyed within the spleen (extravascular hemolysis). The gene for G6PD is located on the X chromosome and has considerable pleomorphism at this site. Two variants are the A type, which is found in 10% of African Americans and is characterized by milder hemolysis of younger red cells, and the Mediterranean type, which is characterized by a more severe hemolysis of red cells of all ages. Hereditary spherocytosis (HS), an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by an abnormality of the skeleton of the red cell membrane that makes the erythrocyte spherical, less deformable, and vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction (extravascular hemolysis). In HS, there is a defect in the spectrin molecule, which then is less binding to protein 4.1. This disorder can be diagnosed in the laboratory by the osmotic fragility test. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), an acquired clonal stem cell disorder, is characterized by abnormal red cells, granulocytes, and platelets. The red cells are abnormally sensitive to the lytic activity of complement due to a deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) linked proteins, namely decay-accelerating factor (DAF, or CD55), membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD59), or CD59 (a C8 binding protein). omplement is activated by acidosis, such as with exercise or sleep, which can produce red morning urine. Complications of PNH include the development of frequent thromboses and possibly acute leukemia. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia refers to hemolysis of red cells caused by narrowing within the microvasculature and is seen in patients with prosthetic hea valves or those with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, or hemolytic-uremic syndrome Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",B

GGT is often increased in alcoholics even without liver disease; in some obese people; and in the presence of high concentrations of therapeutic drugs, such as acetaminophen and phenytoin and carbamazepine (increased up to five times the reference limits), even in the absence of any apparent liver injury. Studies suggest that alcohol induces mitochondrial damage, resulting in the release of mitochondrial AST, which, besides being the predominant form of AST in hepatocytes, has a significantly longer half-life than do extramitochondrial AST and ALT. This frequently results in the disproportionate elevation of AST over ALT, yielding an AST/ALT quotient, also called the DeRitis ratio, of 3-4:1 in alcohol-induced liver disease",A
Action of Proton pump inhibitors are most effective when they are given:,After meals,Sholy before meals,Along with H2 blockers,During prolonged fasting periods,"Proton pump inhibitors should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals.

"A 40 year old male patient complains of severe acute abdominal pain. Radiologic examination reveals multiple gall stones. On histologic examination, foci of necrosis containing shadowy outlines of necrotic cells surrounded by basophilic calcium deposits were seen. Which type of necrosis is seen in this patient?",Coagulative,Liquefactive,Fat,Fibrinoid,"Fat necrosis refers to focal areas of fat destruction, typically resulting from the release of activated pancreatic lipases into the substance of the pancreas and the peritoneal cavity. This occurs in the calamitous abdominal emergency known as acute pancreatitis. In this disorder, pancreatic enzymes that have leaked out of acinar cells and ducts liquefy the membranes of fat cells in the peritoneum, and lipases split the triglyceride esters contained within fat cells. The released fatty acids combine with calcium to produce grossly visible chalky white areas (fat saponification), which enable the surgeon and the pathologist to identify the lesions. On histologic examination, the foci of necrosis contain shadowy outlines of necrotic fat cells surrounded by basophilic calcium deposits and an inflammatory reaction.

Mechanism of action of the following drug is FALSE,Amphotericin B -- Ergosterol inhibition,"Capsofungin -- 3,4 glucans",Fluconozole -- Mitosis inhibition,Flucytosin -- Pyrimidine metabolism inhibition,"(C) Fluconozole - Mitosis inhibition > Antifungal activity of Amphotericin B depends principally on its binding to a sterol moiety, primarily ergosterol that is present in the membrane of sensitive fungi. By virtue of their interaction with these sterols, polyenes appear to form pores or channels that increase the permeability of the membrane, allowing leakage of a variety of small molecules. At concentrations achieved following systemic administration, the major effect of imidazoles and triazoles on fungi is inhibition of 14-a-sterol demethylase, a microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme. Imidazoles and triazoles thus impair the biosynthesis of ergosterol for the cytoplasmic membrane and lead to the accumulation of 14-a-methylsterols. These rnethylsterols may disrupt the close packing of acyl chains of phospholipids, impairing the functions of certain membrane-bound enzyme systems such as ATPase and enzymes of the electron transport system and thus inhibiting growth of the fungi. All susceptible fungi are capable of deaminating flucytosine to 5-fluorouracil, a potent antimetabolite that is used in cancer chemotherapy. Fluorouracil is metabolized first to 5-fluorouracil-ribose monophosphate (5-FUMP) by the enzyme uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (UPRTase, also called uridine monophosphate pyrophosphorylase). As in mammalian cells, 5-FUMP then is either incorporated into RNA (via synthesis of 5-fluorouridine triphosphate) or metabolized to 5-fluoro2'- deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (5-FdUMP), a potent inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase.DNA synthesis is impaired as the ultimate result of this latter reaction. The selective action of flucytosine is due to the lack or low levels of cytosine deaminase in mammalian cells, which prevents metabolism to fluorouracil.Lanosterolfluconazole-demythylaze ergosterol",C

Sweat chloride in cystic fibrosis ?,Decreased,Increased,No change,May increase or decrease,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Increased CYSTIC FIBROSIS Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease of the mucus and sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis follows on autosomal recessive transmission. There is a defect in ion transpo of epithelial cells that affects fluid secretion in Exocrine glands (pancreas) Epithelial lining of respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tract. Pathophysiologv In normal duct epithelia, chloride is transpoed by plasma membrane channels (chloride channels) The primary defect in cystic fibrosis results from abnormal function of an epithelial chloride channel protein encoded by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7q 31.2. Protein encoded by CFTR is a chloride channel through which chloride passes In cystic fibrosis activity of chloride channel is decreased. Along with chloride channel, CFTR can regulate other channel also, for example epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). ENaC is inhibited by normally functioning CFTR; hence, in cystic fibrosis, ENaC activity increases, markedly augmenting sodium uptake across the apical membrane (especially in respiratory and gastrointestinal system). Normal CFTR gene product Defective (mutated) Crl R gene product in cystic fibrosis Induce Cl- conductance through itself (chloride channel) Reduced or lost Cl conductance Inhibits Na+ conductance through Augmented sodium uptake across apical membrane ENaC Clinical features of CF Functions of CFTR are tissue specific, i.e. its functions signify whether the epithelium is secretory (secrete Cl- into lumen) or absorptive (reabsorb Cl- from lumen). Therefore clinical features are tissue specific: Respiratory tract Respiratory epithelium is secretory, i.e. there is active secretion of C1-. CFTR mutation in cystic fibrosis results in loss or reduction of chloride secretion in lumen. Active luminal sodium absorption is also increased (due to loss of inhibition of ENaC activity) Both these decreased Cl secretion and increased Na+ absorption from lumen) lead to increased passive water reabsorption (As you all know diffusion of water occurs from high osmolar to low osmolar concentration area). This results in accumulation of dehydraded hyperconcentrated viscid secretion in respiratory lumen and defective mucociliary clearance obstruction and recurrent respiratory tract infection; and bronchiectasis. 1.Intestine Similar to respiratory epithelium, intestinal epithelium is secretory and in CF there is defective Cl- secretion andenhanced Na+ absorption from lumen - Increased passive reabsorption of water from lumen. This results in accumulation of dehydrated desciated intraluminal contents obstruction of small and largeintestine. Pancreas The absence of CFTR Cl channel in the apical membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelium limits the function of an apical membrane Ct -HCHD3 exchanger to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ (by a passive process) into the duct. The failure to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ leads to retention of enzyme in the pancreas and ultimately destruction of all pancreatic tissues due to pancreatitis. Hepatobiliary system Similar to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, defective biliar Cl- and water secretion causes thickened biliary secretions-biliary cirrhosis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis. Sweat glands In contrast to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, sweat gland duct epithelium is absorptive, i.e. function of normal CFTR in the sweat gland ducts is to reabsorb Cl- ions and Na' from lumen. Therefore, in the sweat ducts, loss of CFTR function leads to decreased reabsorption of NaC1- Hypeonic sweat with increased Na+ and Ct in sweat.",B

Classic example of missense mutation ?,Thalassemia,Sickle cell disease,Sideroblastic anemia,Hemochromatosis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Sickle cell disease In sickle cell anemia there is missense type of point mutation. Mutations A mutation is apermanant change in the DNA. Mutations that affect genii cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease. Mutations that affect somatic cells arc not transmitted to progeny but are impoant in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations. Mutations may be classified into three categories ? 1. Gene mutations The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations. These may of different types depending whether it involves complete gene or single base ? (a) Point mutation A single nucleotide base is subustituted by a different base. When a pyrimidine base is subustituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine Transition. When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa Transversion. This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i.e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product. Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in 13-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine. Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon. 3 Example is 13-thalassemia in which CAG codon in I3-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation. (b) Deletion and inseions Deletion or inseion of one or two base lead to alterations in the reading frame of the DNA strand --> frame shift mutation. If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three framshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized. (c) Trinucleotide repeat mutation Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide. In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain. For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG. 2.Chromosome mutation Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome. 3.Genome mutation Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e.g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",B

Some neurons contain eosinophilic inclusions. What is the proper name for these neuronal inclusions?",Councilman bodies,Hirano bodies,Lewy bodies,Negri bodies,"Rabies is an encephalitis caused by the rabies virus, which is transmitted to humans through contaminated saliva introduced by a bite. Dogs, wolves, foxes, and skunks are the principal reservoirs, but the infection is also acquired from the bite of rabid bats, which often inhabit caves. Viral replication initiates at the site of the bite, and transport to the CNS is mediated by viral entry into peripheral nerves. Destruction of the brainstem neurons by rabies virus initiates painful spasms of the throat, difficulty swallowing, and a tendency to aspirate fluids, which has prompted the designation 'hydrophobia.' Encephalopathy progresses to death within 1 to several weeks. Pathologic features of rabies encephalitis include perivascular cuffing by lymphocytes, neuronophagia, microglial nodules, and 'Negri bodies,' which are distinctive eosinophilic, cytoplasmic inclusions in infected nerve cells.

Which of the following cells do not act as antigen presenting cells. ?-,T-cells,B-cells,Macrophages,Osteoclasts,"Answer is option 1 T cell responses differ from B cell responses in at least two crucial ways. First, T cells are activated by foreign antigen to proliferate and differentiate into effector cells only when the antigen is displayed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells in peripheral lymphoid organs. The T cells respond in this manner because the form of antigen they recognize is different from that recognized by B cells. Whereas B cells recognize intact antigen, T cells recognize fragments of protein antigens that have been paly degraded inside the antigen-presenting cell. The peptide fragments are then carried to the surface of the presenting cell on special molecules called MHC proteins, which present the fragments to T cells. T cells don't act as antigen presenting cells.",A

Which one of the following drugs is used to treat status epilepticus?,Primidone,Carbamazepine,Diazepam,Sodium valporate,"Status epilepticus In status epilepticus seizure activity occurs for >30 min, or two or more seizures occur without recovery of consciousness. Recurrent tonic-clonic convulsions without recovery of consciousness in between is an emergency; fits have to be controlled as quickly as possible to prevent death and permanent brain damage. (a) Diazepam 10 mg i.v. bolus injection (2 mg/ min) followed by fractional doses every 10 min or slow infusion titrated to control the fits has been the standard treatment. However, it redistributes rapidly so that anticonvulsant effect stas fading after 20 min. Lorazepam is less lipid soluble with slow redistribution: anticonvulsant effect of i.v. dose lasts for 6-12 hours. It is therefore preferred; 0.1 mg/kg (injected at 2 mg/ min) is effective in 75-90% cases. (b) Phenobarbitone (100-200 mg i.m./i.v.) or phenytoin (25-50 mg/min in a running saline i.v. line; not to be mixed with glucose solution because it precipitates. Fosphenytoin is used in its place now; maximum 1000 mg phenytoin equivalent). These drugs act more slowly; may be used alternatively to diazepam/lorazepam or substituted for them after the convulsions have been controlled.

Thiazides act on -,PCT,DCT,Glomerulus,Descending limb of loop of Henle,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., DCT o Tubular absorption can be divided into four sites.Site I- Proximal tubuleo Four mechanisms of Na+ transport have been defined in this segment -Direct entry of Na+ along electrochemical gradient.Na+-K+ symport along with active reabsorption of glucose, aminoacids, organic anions and PO4-3.Exchange with H+ by Na+ /H+ exchanger located in the luminal membrane of proximal tubule (PT) epithelial cells. The PT cells secrete FT with the help of carbonic anhydrase. H+ ion exchanges with Na+ present in tubular fluid through Na+-H+ exchanger (antiporter) and forms H2CO3 by combining with HCO3- This H2CO3 is broken into H2O + CO2 by brush border carbonic anhydrase; both CO2 and H2O diffuse inside the cell and recombine to form H2CO3 with the help of intracellular carbonic anhydrase. This H2CO3 is the source of H+. The dissociated HCO3- in the cell is transported to cortical E.C.F. by basolateral membrane Na+-HCO3- symporter resulting in net reabsorption of NaHCO3.Carbonic anydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide) act predominantly in PCT and inhibit NaHCQ3 reabsorption.The disroportionately large HCO3, acetate, PO4-3, passive driving forces for Cl- to diffuse through the paracellularpathway, particularly in the later PT. This takes Na+ and H2O along to maintain electrical neutrality and isotonicity;reabsorption in PT is isotonic.o Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) are solutes which are not absorbed in proximal tubule and therefore retain water.Site II Ascending limb of loop of Henleo The thick ascending limb can be distinguished into two distinct portion.Medullary portion lined by cuboidal cells.Cortical portion lined by flattened cells.o Both portions are relatively impermeable to water but absorb salt actively and thus dilute tubular fluid,o In the medullary portion a distinct luminal membrane carrier transports ions in ratio of Na+-K+-2C1-. The sodium enters the cell is pumped to ECF by Na+ K+ ATPase at the basolateral membrane,o This Na+--K+--2Cl= svmport is inhibited bv loop diuretics (eg-Furosemide).o In addition, a Na+-Cl- symporter moves Cl- down its electrochemical gradient into ECF and carries Na+ along.Site III - cortical diluting segment of loop of Henle and early DTo This segment is also impermeable to H2O and continues to absorb salt through Na+-Cl- symporter.o Thiazide diuretics act at this site.Site IV - late distal tubule and collecting ducto In late DT and CD, Na+ is actively reabsorbed; the cation-anion balance being maintained partly by passive Cl- diffusion and partly by secretion of K+ and H+.o Absorption of Na+ at this site occurs through a specific amiloride sensitive Na+ channel and is controlled to a large extent by aldosterone.o K+- sparing diuretics act at this site.o Collecting tubule is the most important site of K+ secretion by the kidney and the site at which virtually all diuretic induced changes in K+ balance occur - as K+ secretion occurs in exchange of Na+, higher the Na+ load in CD higher will be K+ excretion in urine - Diuretics which act on PCT (maximum absortion of Na+ occurs at PCT) like acetazolamide will cause maximum kaliuresis (K+ excretion in urine).o The principal cells are the major sites of Na', K+, and water transport, and intercalated cells are the primary sites of FT secretion.o The collecting tubule is also the site at which the final urine concentration is determined. ADH (vasopressin) controls the permeability of this segment to water by regulating the insertion of preformed water channels (aquaporin- 2, AQP2) into the apical membrane via a G protein - coupled cAMP - mediated process,o ADH also stimulates the insertion of urea transporter UT1 molecules into the apical membranes of medullary collecting tubule cells. Urea concentration in the medulla plays an important role maintaining the high osmolarity of the medulla and in the concentration of urine.",B

Imatinib used in CML acts by,inhibiting Bcr/abl translocation tyrosine kinase,Blocking the action of P-glycoprotein,Competitive inhibition of ATP binding site of Abl kinase,C-kit kinase inhibition,"Competitive inhibition _of ATP binding site of ABL kinase [Ref. Harrison 16thie p 4781 CML is characterized by the presence of a distinctive molecular abnormality namely philadelphia chromosome. Philadelphia chromosome in formed as a result of reciprocal translocation between long arm of chromosome 22 and chromosome 9 i.e. t (9 ; 22). ABL protooncogene from chromosome 9 is translocated to chromosome 22 where BCR is present and results in formation of BCR-ABL fusion chimeric gene. The drug imatinib mesylate is a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase signal transduction inhibitor. This drug acts as a inhibitor of the ATP binding site on the protein and prevents its phosphorylation and thus its activity. An impoant point CML is caused by reciprocal translocation between BCR and ABL gene located on chromosome 9 and 22. Imatinib mesylate does not block this translocation i.e., BCR ABL translocation. - Instead, it blocks the constitutive abnormal tyrosine kinase, BCR-ABL that is created by the Philadelphia chromose (BCR-ABL). - The drug inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis in BCR-ABL positive cells. Also know Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors Protein kinases are ubiquitous and critical components of signal transduction pathways that transmit information concerning extra cellular or cytoplasmic conditions to the nucleus, thereby influencing gene transcription and/or DNA synthesis. The protein kinases can be classified into three categories: (i) Tyrosine kinase (ii) Serine threonine kinase (iii) Kinases with activity for all three residues Abnormal activation of specific tyrosine kinase has been demonstrated in many human neoplasms. Thus they can be targeted in ceain cancer therapies. There currently are three small-molecular weight protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are FDA approved and many others are in clinical trials. i) Imatinib Imatinib has efficacy in diseases in which the ABL, KIT or PDGFR have dominant roles in driving the proliferation of the tumour. Thus, imatinib shows remarkable therapeutic benefits in patients with - CML (BCR-ABL) - GIST (KIT mutation positive) - CMML (EVT6-PDGFR) ii) Gefitinib The epidennal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the family of tyrosine kinase. Gefitinid is a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase that competitively inhibits ATP binding.

Endothelial cells The alveolar capillary membrane is formed by two separate barriers: Microvascular endothelium and Alveolar epithelium. In ARDS the integrity of this barrier is compromised by either endothelial or epithelial injury or, more commonly, both.' ARDS is a clinical syndrome associated with pathological findings including pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Of these, the pathology most commonly associated with ARDS is DAD, which is characterized by a diffuse inflammation of lung parenchyma. The triggering insult to the parenchyma usually results in an initial release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators secreted by local epithelial and endothelial cells.'-http://en.wikipedia.otg/wiki/Acute_respiratory_ distress syndrome 'The intimal lining of all blood vessels is a single layer of functionally and structurally heterogeneous endothelial cells depending on organ and vascular bed location. Pulmonary microvascular endothelium is a metabolically active organ essential for maintaining adequate pulmonary and systemic cardiovascular homeostasis. Noxious stimuli compromise pulmonary endothelial functional and structural integrity leading to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and parenchymal inflammation. Thus, pulmonary endothelium has a key role in the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and its most severe form, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). '- Curr Opin Crit Care 14:22-30 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Pathogenesis: The alveolar capillary membrane is formed by two separate barriers: Microvascular endothelium Alveolar epithelium. In ARDS the integrity of this barrier is compromised by either endothelial or epithelial injury or, more commonly, both. Markers of endothelial injury and activation such as endothelin and von Willebrand factor can be detected at high levels in the serum of patients with ARDS. The acute consequences of damage to the alveolar capillary membrane include increased vascular permeability and alveolar flooding, loss of diffusion capacity, and widespread surfactant abnormalities caused by damage to type II pneumocytesQ Endothelial injury also triggers the formation of microthrombi that add the insult of ischemic injury. Hyaline membranes so characteristic of ALI/ARDS result from inspissation of protein rich edema fluid that entraps debris of dead alveolar epithelial cellsQ.",D

Pharmacokinetics:- It is well absorbed orally, (bioavailability is ~ 70%), but food decreases absorption; rifampin is to be taken in empty stomach. It is widely distributed in the body: penetrates intracellularly, enters tubercular cavities, caseous masses and placenta. Though it crosses meninges, it is largely pumped out from CNS by P-glycoprotein. It is metabolized in liver to an active deacetylated metabolite which is excreted mainly in bile, some in urine also, t 1/2 of rifampin is variable (2-5 hours). Rifampin resistance:- It is nearly always due to mutation in the rpoB gene reducing its affinity for the drug. No cross resistance with any other antitubercular drug, except rifampin congeners, has been noted. uses of rifampin :- 1. Leprosy, Tuberculosis 2. Prophylaxis of Meningococcal and H. influenzae meningitis and carrier state. 3. Second/third choice drug for MRSA, diphtheroids and Legionella infections. 4.

In persons with ALL, lymphoblasts are overproduced in the bone marrow and continuously multiply, causing damage and death by inhibiting the production of normal cells (such as red and white blood cells and platelets) in the bone marrow and by spreading (infiltrating) to other organs. ALL is most common in childhood, with a peak incidence at 2-5 years of age and another peak in old age.The most common causes of splenomegaly in developed countries are infectious mononucleosis, splenic infiltration with cancer cells from a hematological malignancy and poal hypeension (most commonly secondary to liver disease, and Sarcoidosis).

This blood test is also called protime INRand PT/INR. They are used to determine the clotting tendency of blood, in the measure of warfarindosage, liver damage, and vitamin K status. PT measures the following coagulation factors: I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V (proaccelerin), VII (proconvein), and X (Stua-Prower factor). The reference range for prothrombin time depends on the analytical method used, but is usually around 12-13 seconds (results should always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that performed the test), and the INR in absence of anticoagulation therapy is 0.8-1.2. The target range for INR in anticoagulant use (e.g. warfarin) is 2 to 3. In some cases, if more intense anticoagulation is thought to be required, the target range may be as high as 2.5-3.5 depending on the indication for anticoagulation. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 450",C

In PRV the erythroid series dominates, but there is hyperplasia of all elements. There is plethoric congestion of all organs. The liver and spleen are typically moderately enlarged and may show extramedullary hematopoiesis. Thrombotic complications are an impoant cause of morbidity and moality, and major and minor hemorrhagic complications are also frequent. The red cell count is elevated with hematocrit >60% (despite the fact that serum erythropoietin levels are decreased). The white cell count and platelet count are also elevated. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) activity is elevated, in contrast to the case with chronic myeloid leukemia, where it is reduced.

"A 50-year-old lady presented with a 3-month history of pain in the lower third of the right thigh. There was no local swelling; tenderness was present on deep pressure. Plain X-rays showed an ill-defined intra medullary lesion with blotchy calcification at the lower end of the right femoral diaphysis, possibly enchondroma or chondrosarcoma. Sections showed a cartilaginous tumor. Which of the following histological features (if seen) would be most helpful to differentiate the two tumours?",Focal necrosis and lobulation,Tumor permeation between bone trabeculae at periphery,Extensive myxoid change,High cellularity,"Chondroma (enchondroma) Vs Chondrosarcoma 

The term chondroma is used for benign neoplasm composed of cartilage. It is of two types : -


Enchondroma: - Cartilage tumors occurring within the bone.
Periosteal chondroma: - Cartilage tumors occurring on the surface of the bone.


Chondrosarcoma is the malignant tumor of cartilage.
Growth potential of chondroma is limited and mostly remain stable, but they have the potential to undergo malignant (sarcomatous) change to become chondrosarcoma. In fact, enchondromas are considered to be a low-grade chondrosarcoma.
A painful chondroid neoplasm in a large bone in an adult patient can be either enchondroma or chondrosarcoma.
The differentiation between a low-grade chondrosarcoma and an enchondroma can be difficult.
To make a distinction between these two neoplasms, one has to make use of -

Phagocytic cells in brain -,Oligodendrocytes,Macrophages,Microglia,Astrocytes,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., MicrogliaMicroglia are the major phagocytic cells in the brain.Phagocvtosis Phagocytosis and release of enzymes by neutrophils and macrophages are responsible for eliminating injurious agents.o Phagocytosis involves the following three steps.1. Recognition and attachmentPhagocytosis of microbes and dead cells is initiated by recognition of paicles by receptors expressed on leukocyte surface.These receptors are Mannose receptors and scavenger receptors.These receptors bind a variety of microbes.2. EnglulfmentBinding of a paicle to phagocytic leukocyte receptors initiates the process of active phagocytosis of the paicles.During engulment, extension of the cytoplasm, i.e., pseudopods flow around the paicle to be engulfed. Eventually, this results in complete enclosure of the paicle within a phagosome created by the plasma membrane.Membrane of this phagocytic vacuole (Phagosome) fuses with the membrane of lysosome to form phagolysosome resulting in discharge of lysosomal granule's content into phagosome.During this process neutrophils and macrophages become progressively degranulated.Phagocytosis is dependent on polymerization of actin (similar to chemotoxis that is also dependent on polymerisation of actin).3. Killing and degradationKillingMicrobial killing is accomplished largely by oxygen-depending mechanism, i.e., due to generation of reactive oxygen species.The generation of reactive oxygen species is due to rapid activation on an oxidase - NADPH oxidase. Reactive oxygen species cause membrane damage, cytoskeletal damage and DNA damage.Bacterial killing can also occur by oxygen-independent mechanisms, through action of substances in leukocyte granules -3 Bacterial permeability increasign protein (BPI), lysozyme, lactoferrin, major basic protein and defensin.DegradationAfter killing, acid hydrolases, which are normally stored in lysosomes, degrade the microbes within phagolysosome.",C

Which of the following congenital lesion is deformity:,Potter sequence,CTEV,Congenital heart disease,Cleft lip,"Ans: B (CTEV) CONGENITAL ANOMALIES Robbins 7th/470-74# Congenital anomalies are morphologic defects that are present at birth, but some, such as cardiac defects and renal anomalies, may not become clinically apparent until years later.The term congenital does not imply or exclude a genetic basis for the birth defect. It is estimated that about 3% of newborns have a major anomaly, defined as an anomaly having either cosmetic or functional significance.Various kinds of errors in morphogenesis are--mal- formations, disruptions, deformations, sequences, and syndromes.MalformationsIt represents primary errors of morphogenesis, in other words there is an intrinsically abnormal developmental process.They are usually multifactorial rather than the result of a single gene or chromosomal defect.Some, such as congenital heart defects and anencephaiy (absence of brain), involve single body systems, whereas in other cases multiple malformations involving many organs may coexist.DisruptionsIt result from secondary destruction of an organ or body region that was previously normal in development; thus, in contrast to malformations, disruptions arise from an extrinsic disturbance in morphogenesis.Understandably, disruptions are not heritable and hence are not associated with risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies.Deformations Robbins 7th/472It like disruptions, also representan extrinsic disturbance of deve/opmentratherthananintrinsicerrorofmorphogenesis.Deformations are common problems, affecting approximately 2% of newborn infants to varying degrees. Fundamental to the pathogenesis of deformations is localized or generalized compression of the growing fetus by abnormal biomechanical forces, leading eventually to a variety of structural abnormalities.The most common underlying factor responsible for deformations is uterine constraint. Between the 35th and 38th weeks of gestation, rapid increase in the size of the fetus outpaces the growth of the uterus, and the relative amount of amniotic fluid (which normally acts as a cushion) also decreases. Thus, even the normal fetus is subjected to some form of uterine constraint.Several factors increase the likelihood of excessive compression of the fetus resulting in deformations. Maternal factors include first pregnancy, small uterus, malformed (bicornuate) uterus, and leiomyomas. Fetal or placental factors include oligohydramnios, multiple fetuses, and abnormal fetal presentation.An example of a deformation is clubfeet (CTEV), often a component of Potter sequenceSequenceIt is a pattern of cascade anomalies. Approximately half the time, congenital anomalies occur singly; in the remaining cases, multiple congenital anomalies are recognized.In some instances, the constellation of anomalies may be explained by a single, localized aberration in organogenesis (malformation, disruption, or deformation) leading to secondary effects in other organs.A good example of a sequence is the oligohydramnios (or Potter) sequenceSyndromeIt is a constellation of congenital anomalies, believed to be pathologically related, that, in contrast to a sequence, cannot be explained on the basis of a single, localized, initiating defect.Syndromes are most often caused by a single etiologic agent, such as a viral infection or specific chromosomal abnormalitv, which simultaneously affects several tissues.Fig. Malformations. Human malformations can range in severity from the incidental to the lethal. Polydactyly (one or more extra digits) and syndactyly (fusion of digits), both of which are illustrated in A, have little functional consequence when they occur in isolation. Similarly, cleft lip (B), with or without associated cleft palate, is compatible with life when it occurs as an isolated anomaly; in the present case, however, this child had an underlying malformation syndrome (trisomy 13) and expired because of severe cardiac defects. The stillbirth illustrated in C represents a severe and essentially lethal malformation, where the midface structures are fused or ill-formed; in a/most all cases, this degree of external dysmorphogenesis is associated with severe internaI anomalies such as maldevelopment of the brain and cardiac defects.",B

Agonist has affinity for -,Active receptor,Inactive receptor,Both,None.,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Active receptor Drug-receptor binding and agonism o A receptor can exist in two conformational states: (i) Active state (Ra) (ii) Inactive state (Ri) o Usually, inactive state predominates in the absence of drug and the basal signal output will be low. o The extent to which the equilibrium is shifted toward the active state is determined by the relative affinity of the drug for the two conformations. o Agonist has higher affinity for the active confirmation and drives the equilibrium to the active state and thereby activate the receptor. A full agonist is sufficiently selective for the active confirmation that at a saturating concentration it will drive the receptor essentially completely to active state -3 maximum activity can be produced by agonist. o Paial agonist has only moderately higher affinity for the active confirmation (Ra) than inactive confirmation (Ri). Its effect will be less, even at saturating concentrations, so paial agonist cannot produce a full biological response at any concentration --> paial agonist has submaximal intrinsic activity. o Antagonist has equal affinity for both active (Ra) and inactive (Ri) confirmation. So, antagonist will not alter the equilibrium between Ra & Ri, and will not produce an effect --> antagonist has no intrinsic activity. o Inverse agonist has greater affinity for inactive confirmation (Ri) and drives the equilibrium to the inactive state. So, inverse agonist has an effect opposite to that of an agonist --> inverse agonist has intrinsic activity with a minus sign that means opposite intrinsic activity. Examples of such inverse agonists at G-protein coupled receptors are Famotidine, losaan, metoprolol and risperidone. 1. Agonist has affinity for active configuration (Ra) 2. Paial agonist has affinity for bath active (Ra) as well as inactive (Ri) confirmation, but has more affinity for active configuration (Ra > Ri) 3.

Concentric hyperophy of hea is caused by:September 2007,Hyperophic cardiomyopathy,Congestive hea failure,Systemic hypeension,Mitral regurgitation,"Ans. A: Hyperophic cardiomyopathyIn the case of chronic pressure overload as occurs with chronic hypeension or aoic valve stenosis, the ventricular chamber radius may not change; however, the wall thickness greatly increases as new sarcomere are added in-parallel to existing sarcomeres. This is termed concentric hyperophy.This type of ventricle becomes 'stiff' (i.e., compliance is reduced), which can impair filling and lead to diastolic dysfunction. Sometimes the chamber radius is increased and the wall thickness is increased moderately - this is termed eccentric hyperophy - and can occur when there is both volume and pressure overload. An example of this would be when systolic dysfunction and a volume overload state occur in a concentrically hyperophied hea, thus stimulating chronic chamber dilation.

Nitroblue tetrazolium test is used for ?,Phagocytosis,Complement,T cell,B cell,"Phagocytosis In the previous discussion we have seen that with phagocytosis neutrophils gets activated and there is rapid burst of oxygen consumption and activation of hexose monophosphate shunt. The rapid burst occurs due to rapid activation of the enzyme complex NADPH oxidase which oxidizes NADPH and in the process reduces oxygen to superoxide anion (0,-). It catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion which is then conveed to hydrogen peroxide and other toxic oxygen products (011-) (free radicals). H.,02 then combines with myeloperoxidase and halide to form an effective antibacterial compound. (HOCC-) Chronic granulomatous disorder Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder of phagocytes. Patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease have leucocytes that ingest microbes normally but lack the fully functional NADPH oxidase system, required to produce the superoxide anion. In these patients there is no respiratory burst due to lack of one of the four NADPH oxidase subunits in neutrophils. Thus, these patients are not able to generate superoxide, H202 and OH- ions (free radicals). (Thus the), are not able to kill the bacterias). Leucocytes from the patients of chronic granulomatous disease fail to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium during phagocytosis. This propey has been used as a screening method for the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease. More on chronic granulomatous disease:- Inheritence - X linked (more common) - Autosomal recessive There is increased incidence of bacterial infection. The bacterias involved in recurrent infections are catalase positive pyogenic pathogens such as staphylococci and colifonns.

Most drugs with this action block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, 1Kr.Class 4 action is blockade of the cardiac calcium current.Class IV agents act by blocking voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Class IV drugs in therapeutic use as antidysrhythmic drugs (e.g. verapamil) act on L-type channels. Class IV drugs slow conduction in the SA and AV nodes where action potential propagation depends on slow inward Ca2+ current, slowing the heart and terminating SVT by causing partial AV block. They shorten the plateau of the action potential and reduce the force of contraction. Reduced Ca2+ entry reduces after-depolarisation and thus suppresses premature ectopic beats.",A

In wegners glomerulonephritis characteristic feature seen is aEUR',Granulomas in the vessel wall,Focal Necrotizing Glomerulonepluitis,Nodular Glomerulo Sclerosis,Interstitial Granuloma,"Focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis Wegener's granulomatosis is a distinct clinicopathologic entity characterized by granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tracts together with glomerulonephritis. The histopathological hallmark of Wegener's granulomatosis is necrotizing vasculitis of small aeries and veins together with granuloma formation which may be either intravascular or extravascular. An impoant point to note, Though it is called granulomatous vasculitis:? - Granulomas in Wegener's .granulomatosis are seen only in lungs or respiratory tract. Granulottm formation is rarely seen in other organs. Other organs, only demonstrate necrotizing vasculitis. So Wegener's granulomatosis can also be defined as Granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tracts together with glomerulonephritis. Robbin's defines Wegener's granulomatosis as 'necrotizing vasculitis' (not granulomatous vasculitis). According to Robbin's Wegener's granulomatosis is a necrotizing vasculitis characterized by a triad of :? - Acute necrotizing granuloma of upper respiratory tract (ear, nose, sinuses, throat) or the lower respiratory tract. - Necrotizing or granulomatous vasculitis affecting small to medium sized vessels (e.g. capillaries, venules, aeriole and aeria) most prominent in the lungs and upper airways but affecting other sites as well. - Renal disease in the form of focal necrotizing often crescenteric glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis in Wegener's granulomatosis Wegener's. glomerulonephritis is characterized by 'focal and segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis'.

Gardner syndrome is associated with all of the following except: March 2010,Intestinal polyps,Osteomas,Dental abnormalities,Tumors of the CNS,"Tumors of the CNS Gardner syndrome is a variant of the disease 'familial adenomatous polyposis' (FAP), an inherited disease that is characterised by gastrointestinal polyps, multiple osteomas (benign bone tumours), thyroid tumors, dental abnormalities and skin and soft tissue tumours. Polyps tend to form at pubey with the average age of diagnosis around 25 years of age. In almost all patients, polyps will progress to malignancy, resulting in colorectal cancer so that timely detection is essential. Clinical features of Gardner syndrome can be divided into two types, cutaneous and non-cutaneous. The most noticeable cutaneous feature of Gardner syndrome is the appearance of epidermoid cysts. These cysts can be differentiated from ordinary epidermoid cysts by the following factors: - Epidermoid cysts of Gardner syndrome occur at an earlier age (around pubey) than ordinary cysts - Epidermoid cysts occur in less common locations such as the face, scalp and extremities compared to ordinary cysts - Cysts tend to be multiple in over half of the patients with Gardner syndrome As with ordinary epidermoid cysts, cysts in Gardner syndrome are usually asymptomatic (without symptoms), however in some cases they may be pruritic (itchy) and/or inflamed, and they may rupture. Other cutaneous features include fibromas, lipomas, leiomyomas, neurofibromas and pigmented skin lesions. Non-cutaneous features include: - Gastrointestinal polyps that nearly always transform into colonic adenocarcinomas (colon cancer). - Osteomas - these benign bone tumours are essential in making the diagnosis of Gardner syndrome. They occur most commonly in the mandible (jawbone) but may also grow in the skull and long bones. - Dental abnormalities - as well as osteomas in the jaw there may be other dental abnormalities such as unerupted extra teeth and caries - Multifocal pigmented lesions of the fundus in the eye - seen in 80% of patients. These lesions may be present sholy after bih and can be the first marker of the disease.",D

The primary function of Toll-like Receptors is?,Activation of Immune System,Vasodilation,Regulation of Calcium channel,Second Messenger,"In the late 1990s and early 2000s, researchers identified mammalian analogs of the Drosophila Toll receptor, cloned the mammalian Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), identified TLR4 as the receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the membrane transducer for LPS signaling in mononuclear phagocytes and other cells, and identified other TLRs as receptors for other microbial components.
CD 14 binds bacterial LPS (endotoxin) and, as a component of a multimolecular complex, plays an important role in LPS-induced activation, inflammatory response, and innate immunity. LPS is captured by a serum LPS-binding protein and is transported to CD14, which binds the complex. CD14, however, cannot trigger activation because it lacks an intracellular region. This function is mediated by one of a group of molecules known as Toll-like receptors (TLR), as they are structurally homologous to the Toll receptors of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.",A

Which of the following is not true about idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura?,Antibodies of IgM class,Autoantibodies to Gp IIb/ Ilia or IB IX,Increased megakaryocytes in bone marrow,Spleen is normal in size,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Antibodies of IgM class I dopathic thrombocytopenic purpura :? There are two clinical subtypes of primary I.T.P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from formation of antiplatelet antibodies. Pathogenesis Chronic ITP is caused by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins most often Hb-lIla or Ib-IX. In overwhelming majority of cases the antiplatelet antibodies are of the .IgL, class. The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to that seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Opsonized platelets are rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. The spleen is the major site of the destruction of platelets. Pathology The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic. The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in spleen, the spleen size remains normal. On histological examination there is congestion of the sinusoids and hyperactivity and enlargement of the splenic follicles manifested by the formation of prominent germinal centres. Sometimes scattered megakaryocytes are found within the sinuses and sinusoidal walls. This represents a very mild form of extramedullary hematopoiesis. These splenic findings are not sufficiently distinctive to be considered diagnostic. Bone Marrow Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes. These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction. The impoance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure. A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I.T.P.",A

Pathologically, the renal vessels demonstrate a concentric obliteration of aerioles by an increase in smooth-muscle cells, and protein deposition in a laminar configuration that includes fibrin material, which leads to total and subtotal occlusion of the vessels. These changes are called hyperplastic aeriolosclerosis. Medial calcific sclerosis (Monckeberg's aeriosclerosis) is characterized by dystrophic calcification in the tunica media of muscular aeries. There is no narrowing of the lumen of the affected vessels Hyaline aeriolosclerosis as seen in diabetes mellitus is presumably caused by leakage of plasma components across the endothelium Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) is occlusion by a proliferative inflammatory process in aeries of heavy cigarette smokers.

Digitalis reduces the ventricular rate in AF by decreasing the number of impulses that are able to pass down the A-V node and bundle of His. It increases effective refractory period-ERP refractoriness) of A-V node by direct, vagomimetic and antiadrenergic action - the minimum interval between consecutive impulses that can successfully traverse the conducting tissue is increased. A degree of A-V block is naturally established in AF. Because of the relatively long ERP of A-V node, many atrial impulses impinge on it while it is still refractory; others falling early in the relative refractory period get extinguished by decremental conduction - These concealed impulses leave upper margin of A-V node refractory for a fuher period. Thus, any influence which increases atrial rate in AF (e.g. digitalis), by itself reduces ventricular rate.",A

Aschoff nodules are characteristically seen in: (Repeat),Rheumatic carditis,Infective endocarditis,Viral Myocarditis,Libman-Sacks endocarditis,"Ans: A (Rheumatic carditis) Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition, Pg: 529Explanation:Rheumatic Fever (RF)MorphologyDuring acute RF, local inflammatory lesions are found in various tissues.Distinctive lesions occur in the heart, called Aschoff bodies, which consist of foci of lymphocytes (primarily T cells), occasional plasma cells, andPlump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cells (pathognomonic for RF) with abundant cytoplasm and multiple central round-to ovoid nuclei in which the chromatin is disposed in a central, slender, wavy ribbon (Hence, also known as 'caterpillar cells').During acute RF. diffuse inflammation and Aschoff bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the heart, causing pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis (pancarditis).Inflammation of the endocardium and the leftsided valves typically results in fibrinoid necrosis within the cusps or along the tendinous cords.Overlying these necrotic foci are small (l - to 2- mm) vegetations, called verrucae. along the lines of closure.These vegetations place RHD within a small group of disorders that are associated with vegetative valve disease, each with its own characteristic morphologic features.Subendocardial lesions, perhaps exacerbated by regurgitant jets, may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques, usually in the left atrium.The cardinal anatomic changes of the mitral valve in chronic RHD are leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening, and thickening and fusion of the tendinous cords.In chronic disease the mitral valve is virtually always involved.The mitral valve is affected alone in 65% to 70% of cases, and along with the aortic valve in another 25% of cases.Tricuspid valve involvement is infrequent, and the pulmonary valve is only rarely affected. Because of the increase in calcific aortic stenosis and the reduced frequency of RHD. rheumatic aortic stenosis now accounts for less than 10% of cases of acquired aortic stenosis.Fibrous bridging across the valvular commissures and calcification create 'fish mouth' or 'buttonhole' stenoses.With tight mitral stenosis, the left atrium progressively dilates and may harbor mural thrombi in the appendage or along the wall, either of which can embolize.Microscopically, in the mitral leaflets there is organization of the acute inflammation and 'subsequent diffuse fibrosis and neovascularization that obliterate the originally layered and avascular leaflet architecture.",A

Chediakhigashi syndrome is characterized by following except ?,Is autosomal recessive disorder,Mutation in LYST gene,Occulocutaneous albinism,Effective phagolysosome formation,"Ans. is `d' i.e., Effective phagolysosome formation Chediakhigashi syndrome :?It is an autosomal recessive disorder.Chediakhigashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene.This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes.Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins.During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias.Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome.Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation.As a result, most people with chediakhigashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening.Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected.The other cells involved are - Melanosomes of melanocytes Dense bodies of platelets Granules of schwann cellsThere are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells.In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism-Le the colour of skin, hair and eye is reduced.Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders.Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy.Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase, (lymphoma like stage).This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E.B.virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs.The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death.",D
Plasma half life of insulin is: March 2013,1 minute,10 minutes,1 hour,2 hours,"Ans. B i.e. 10 minutes Degradation of insulin Once an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action, it may be released back into the extracellular environment, or it may be degraded by the cell. The two primary sites for insulin clearance are the liver and the kidney. The liver clears most insulin during first-pass transit, whereas the kidney clears most of the insulin in systemic circulation. Degradation normally involves endocytosis of the insulin-receptor complex, followed by the action of insulin-degrading enzyme. An insulin molecule produced endogenously by the pancreatic beta cells is estimated to be degraded within about one hour after its initial release into circulation (insulin half-life - 4-6 minutes)",B

All the mentioned drugs cause this condition except chlorpromazine.'The cornea, the conjunctiva, and even the eyelids can be affected by systemic medications. One of the most common drug deposits found in the cornea is from the cardiac medication amiodarone. It deposits in the inferior and central cornea in a whorl-like pattern termed cornea verticillata. It appears as fine tan or brown pigment in the epithelium. Fortunately, the deposits seldom affect vision, and therefore, this rarely is a cause to discontinue the medication. The deposits disappear slowly if the medication is stopped. Other medications, including indomethacin, atovaquone, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine, can cause a similar pattern. '--Goodman Gillman 12/e p1793'The phenothiazines. including chlorpromazine and thioridazine, can cause brown pigmentary deposits in the cornea, conjunctiva, and eyelids. The deposits generally are found in Descemet's membrane and the posterior cornea. They typically do not affect vision. The ocular deposits generally persist after discontinuation of the medication andean even worsen, perhaps because the medication deposits in the skin are slowly released and accumulate in the eye. '--Goodman Gillman 12/e p1793'Cornea verticillata: This is a whorl-like opacity in the corneal epithelium seen in patients on long-term treatment with medication such as amiodarone, chloroquine, phenothiazines and indomethacin. It is also seen in patients with Fabry disease and its carrier state. The condition is generally asymptomatic, harmless and reversible on stopping the drug.

Granulomatous inflammation is which type of hypersensitivity? -,Type I,Type II,Type III,Type IV,"Several autoimmune disorders, as well as pathologic reactions to environmental chemicals and persistent microbes, are now known to be caused by T cells . The occurrence and significance of T lymphocyte-mediated tissue injury have been increasingly appreciated as the methods for detecting and purifying T cells from patients' circulation and lesions have improved. This group of diseases is of great clinical interest because many of the new, rationally designed biologic therapies for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases have been developed to target abnormal T cell reactions. Two types of T cell reactions are capable of causing tissue injury and disease: (1) cytokine-mediated inflammation, in which the cytokines are produced mainly by CD4+ T cells, and (2) direct cell cytotoxicity, mediated by CD8+ T cells . In inflammation, exemplified by the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, CD4+ T cells of the TH1 and TH17 subsets secrete cytokines, which recruit and activate other cells, especially macrophages, and these are the major effector cells of injury. In cell-mediated cytotoxicity, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are responsible for tissue damage. Robbins 9 th edition page no. 118",D
Ratio of fat cells and RBC in bone marrow ?,4:01,1:01,1:02,2:01,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., 4 : 1o Dont get confuse with previous explanation.

ESR is increased in -,Sickle cell anemia,Multiple myeloma,Polycythemia vera,Thalassemia,"Factors affecting ESR
1. Plasma

RBCs carry a negative electric charge, whereas plasma carries a postive charge.
Any condition in plasma that increases its positive charge, increases the rouleaux formation and increases ESR by lengthening stage I.
Following factors increase positive charge and ESR : -

i) Fibrinogen → Any condition which increases fibrinogen level will increase ESR - e.g.,
a) Infection
b) Inflammation
c) TB
ii)  Globulin → Conditions which increases globulin level will increase ESR.

Kala azar
Multiple myeloma
Some lymphoproliferative disorders
Rheumatic fever

iii) Cholesterol → Hypercholesterolemia increases ESR.

Any condition in plasma that decreases its positive charge, decreases rouleaux formation and decreases ESR.
	(a) Albumin → Hyperalbuminemia decreases ESR.
	(b) Decreased fibrinogen → In afibrinogenemia, ESR is zero.

2. RBC's - Increase in blood count as in polycythemia decreases ESR due to the jostling (or pushing one another) effect on the cells.
- Anemia increases the ESR by opposite effect, there are two exceptions.
i) Sickle cell anemia
ii) Microcytic hypochromic anemia (iron deficiency, Thalassemia)
In the last two types of anemia, ESR decreases because altered red cell shape prevents rouleux formation.

3. Physiological variations
ESR is low in infancy
ESR is high at puberty
ESR is greater in women than man.

4.Ohters
ESR is decreased in congestive heart failure
ESR is increased in acute myocardial infarction",B

It is a focal development malformation that resembles a neoplasm in the tissue of origin. But, it is not a neoplasm because it grows at the same rate as the surrounding tissues unlike neoplasm whose growth exceeds the growth of surrounding tissue. Choristoma Choristoma is the ectopic rest of normal tissue, i .e. , the normal tissue is present at a different anatomical site of the body. For example, presence of pancreatic tissue in mucosa of small intestine. Normally arranged tissue at a different anatomical site (ectopic site) Choristoma. Abnormally arranged tissue present at normal site -Hamaoma",C
Which is a prodrug?,Enalapril,Clonidine,Salmeterol,Acetazolamide,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Enalapril Remember,The end result of drug metabolism is usually the abolition of activity of the drugs and conversion of drug from lipid soluble to water soluble compounds but sometimes the drug may be converted from its inactive form to active form.ProdrugsFew drugs are inactive as such and need conversion in the body to one or more active metabolites.

"A 73-year-old woman has had episodes of chest pain during the past week. She is afebrile. Her pulse is 80/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. On auscultation of the chest, heart sounds seem distant, but the lung fields are clear. Neck veins are distended to the angle of the jaw, even while sitting. There is a darkly pigmented, irregular, 1.2-cm skin lesion on the right shoulder. A chest radiograph shows prominent borders on the left and right sides of the heart. Pericardiocentesis yields bloody fluid. Laboratory findings include a serum troponin I level of 0.3 ng/mL. Which of the following lesions is the most likely cause of these findings?",Calcific aortic stenosis,Coronary atherosclerosis,Epicardial metastases,Mitral valvulitis,"Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion most commonly is caused by either tumor or tuberculosis. The most common neoplasm involving the heart is metastatic cancer because primary cardiac neoplasms are rare. The most common primary sites are nearby-lung, breast, and esophagus. The skin lesion in this patient is likely to be a malignant melanoma, which tends to metastasize widely, including to the heart. Most cardiac metastases involve the epicardium/pericardium. (By convention, even though epicardial surfaces are often involved most severely, the term pericardial effusion is typically used when fluid is present, or pericarditis is used when inflammation is present.) A large effusion can cause tamponade, which interferes with cardiac motion. Calcific aortic stenosis leads to left-sided congestive heart failure, with pulmonary edema as a key finding. Coronary atherosclerosis may lead to myocardial infarction, which can be complicated by ventricular rupture and hemopericardium, but the level of troponin I, in this case, suggests that infarction did not occur. Rheumatic heart disease mainly affects the cardiac valves, but acute rheumatic fever can produce fibrinous pericarditis. Tuberculosis is unlikely in this case because no pulmonary lesions were seen on the radiograph.",C
"In lobar pneumonia, the presence of fibrinosuppurative exudate with disintegration of red cells is seen in the stage of -",Congestion,Red hepatization,Gray hepatization,Resolution,"Ref:Textbook of pathology (Harsh mohan) 6th edition,page no.468 STAGE OF CONGESTION: INITIAL PHASE . The initial phase represents the early acute inflammatory response to bacterial infection and lasts for 1 to 2 days. Grossly, the affected lobe is enlarged, heavy, dark red and congested. Cut surface exudes blood-stained frothy fluid. Histologically, typical features of acute inflammatory response to the organisms are seen. These are as under i) Dilatation and congestion of the capillaries in the alveolar walls. ii) Pale eosinophilic oedema fluid in the air spaces. iii) A few red cells and neutrophils in the intra-alveolar fluid. iv) Numerous bacteria demonstrated in the alveolar fluid by Gram's staining. 2. RED HEPATISATION: EARLY CONSOLIDATION This phase lasts for 2 to 4 days. The term hepatisation in pneumonia refers to liver-like consistency of the affected lobe on cut section. Grossly, the affected lobe is red, firm and consolidated. The cut surface of the involved lobe is airless, red-pink, dry, granular and has liver-like consistency. The stage of red hepatisation is accompanied by serofibrinous pleurisy. Histologically, the following features are observed. i) The oedema fluid of the preceding stage is replaced by strands of fibrin. ii) There is marked cellular exudate of neutrophils and extravasation of red cells. iii) Many neutrophils show ingested bacteria. iv) The alveolar septa are less prominent than in the first stage due to cellular exudation. 3. GREY HEPATISATION: LATE CONSOLIDATION This phase lasts for 4 to 8 days. Grossly, the affected lobe is firm and heavy. The cut surface is dry, granular and grey in appearance with liverlike consistency.. The change in colour from red to grey begins at the hilum and spreads towards the periphery. Fibrinous pleurisy is prominent. Histologically, the following changes are present i) The fibrin strands are dense and more numerous. ii) The cellular exudate of neutrophils is reduced due to disintegration of many inflammatory cells as evidenced by their pyknotic nuclei. The red cells are also fewer. The macrophages begin to appear in the exudate. iii) The cellular exudate is often separated from the septal walls by a thin clear space. iv) The organisms are less numerous and appear as degenerated forms. 4. RESOLUTION . This stage begins by 8th to 9th day if no chemotherapy is administered and is completed in 1 to 3 weeks. However, antibiotic therapy induces resolution on about 3rd day. Resolution proceeds in a progressive manner. Grossly, the previously solid fibrinous constituent is liquefied by enzymatic action, eventually restoring the normal aeration in the affected lobe. The process of softening begins centrally and spreads to the periphery. The cut surface is grey-red or diy brown and frothy, yellow, creamy fluid can be expressed on pressing. The pleural reaction may also show resolution but may undergo organisation leading to fibrous obliteration of pleural cavity. Histologically, the following features are noted: i) Macrophages are the predominant cells in the alveolar spaces, while neutrophils diminish in number. Many of the macrophages contain engulfed neutrophils and debris. ii) Granular and fragmented strands of fibrin in the alveolar spaces are seen due to progressive enzymatic digestion. iii) Alveolar capillaries are engorged. iv) There is progressive removal of fluid content as well as cellular exudate from the air spaces, paly by expectoration but mainly by lymphatics, resulting in restoration of normal lung parenchyma with aeration.",C

Goodpasture's syndrome is characterized by -,Necrotising hemorrhagic interstitial pneumonitis,Alveolitis,Patchy consolidation,Pulmonary edema,"Goodpasture syndrome

Goodpasture syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the rapid destruction of the kidney and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
It is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies targeted against basement membrane of lung and kidney.
These antibodies are directed against the noncollagenous domain of the α -3 chains of type IV collagen (collagen of basement membrane).
The antibodies initiate an inflammatory destruction of the basement membrane in kidney glomeruli and lung alveoli.
In Goodpasture syndrome, the immune reaction is type II hypersensitivity.

Morphological changes
I. Lung

The lungs are heavy, with areas of red-brown consolidation.
There is focal necrosis of alveolar walls associated with intraalveolar hemorrhages.
Alveoli contain hemosiderin-laden macrophages.
Linear deposits of immunoglobulins along the basement membranes of the septal walls.

II. Kidney

Diffuse proliferative rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
Focal necrotizing lesion and crescents in >50% of glomeruli.
Linear deposits of immunoglobulins and complement along the glomerular basement membrane.

Clinical manifestations

Which of the following is a broad spectrum systemic antifungal agent?,Econazole,Miconazole,Ketoconazole,Clotrimazole,"Ketoconazole (KTZ) It is the first orally effective broad-spectrum antifungal drug, useful in both dermatophytosis and deep myc osis. The oral absorption of KTZ is facilitated by gastric acidity because it is more soluble at lower pH. Hepatic metabolism is extensive; metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces. Elimination of KTZ is dose dependent: tlh varies from llh to 6 hours. Penetration in CSF is poor: not effective in fungal men ingitis. However, therapeutic concentrations are attained in the skin and vaginal fluid. In spite of relatively sho tlh, a single daily dose is satisfactory in less severe cases. The usual dose is 200 mg OD or BD; higher doses are sometimes required. Clotrimazole It is effective in the topical treatment of tinea infections like ringworm: Econazole It is similar to clotrimazole; penetrates superficial layers of the skin and is highly effective in dermatophytosis, otomycosis, oral thrush, but is somewhat inferior to clotrimazole in vaginitis Miconazole It is a highly efficacious (>90% cure rate) drug for tinea, pityriasis versicolor, otomycosis, cutaneous and vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Primary amyloidosis is one of the more common forms of systemic amyloidosis, and can affect a variety of organs, including the hea, kidney, peripheral nerve, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract. In primary amyloidosis, the amyloid is composed of immunoglobulin light chains, and the disease is now interpreted as a plasma cell disorder closely related to multiple myeloma. This interpretation is clinically significant, as it has led to modern treatments of primary amyloidosis (which formerly had a dismal prognosis) with the chemotherapies designed for multiple myeloma. The treatments are effective only if the disease is recognized and passed to the appropriate specialists as early as possible in the clinical course. Amyloid AA is seen in inflammation-associated amyloidosis and familial Mediterranean fever. Beta-2-microglobulin comprises the amyloid of dialysis-associated amyloidosis.

CEA is elevated in all of the following except: March 2007,Alcoholic cirrhosis,Ulcerative colitis,Carcinoma colon,Prostatic carcinoma,"Ans. D: Prostatic carcinoma An elevated level of a tumor marker can indicate cancer; however, there can also be other causes of the elevation. Tumor markers can be produced directly by the tumor or by non-tumor cells as a response to the presence of a tumor. As used in oncology, they are as follows: - Screening for common cancers on a population basis Example: elevated prostate specific antigen suggests prostate cancer. - Monitoring of cancer survivors after treatment Example: elevated AFP in a child previously treated for teratoma suggests relapse with endodermal sinus tumor. - Diagnosis of specific tumor types, paicularly in ceain brain tumors and other instances where biopsy is not feasible. Tumor markers can be classified in two groups: Cancer-specific markers and tissue-specific markers. - Cancer-specific markers: An example of a cancer-specific marker, CEA, or carcinoembryonic antigen, is a blood-borne protein, first noted to be produced by tumors of the gastrointestinal system. Fuher investigation showed that it was produced by the occasional lung and breast cancer case, meaning that an elevated level does not mean a bowel cancer. However, in a patient with a history of a treated bowel cancer, a rising CEA level can be an early sign of bowel cancer return. A sequence of steady low CEA readings can provide much needed reassurance to the post-operative patient. Also, a rising sequence of CEA readings should ale the physician to the need for diagnostic tests such as PET scans. - Tissue-specific markers: Tissue-specific markers are related to specific tissues which have developed cancer. Generally speaking, these substances are not specifically related to the tumor, and may be present at elevated levels when no cancer is present. Examples include PSA, beta-HCG - (Human chorionic gonadotropin), AFP - (Alpha-fetoprotein), AFP-L3 - (a lectin-reactive AFP) and Thyroglobulin. For example, if man has an elevated PSA, a search for prostate cancer will be undeaken. If an individual has an elevated level of beta-HCG, AFP or AFP-L3%, a search for a testicular or liver cancer, respectively, will be made. PSA (Prostate specific antigen) is produced by the normal prostate. It is a protein enzyme called a serine protease that usually acts as an anticoagulant to keep semen liquid. Only small amounts leak into the circulation in normal circumstances. Enlarged prostates leak more substantial amounts, and cancerous prostates also leak substantial amounts. o Beta-hCG: Elevated levels cannot prove the presence of a tumor, and low levels do not rule it out (an exception is in males who do not naturally produce beta-hCG). Neveheless, elevated beta-hCG levels fall after successful treatment (e.g. surgical intervention or chemotherapy) and a recurrence can often be detected by the finding of rising levels.",D
Which of the following helps in generating oxygen burst in the neurophils ?,NADPH oxidase,Sod (superoxide dismutase),Catalase,Glutathione peroxidose,"NADPH oxidase Although oxygen is the lifeline of all cells and tissues, its molecular form i.e., oxygen free radicals (or reactive oxygen intermediate) are devastating for cells. Cells generate energy by reducing molecular oxygen to water. During this process small amounts of paially reduced reactive oxygen forms are produced as a byproduct of respiration. They are called free radicals or reactive oxygen species. Free radicals are chemical species that have single unpaired electron in an outer orbit. This makes them highly reactive. Free radicals are devastating for the cell as they damage lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Examples of free radical or reactive oxygen species Superoxide 02- Hydroxyl radical OH? Hydrogen peroxide (H202) The noxious effect of free radicals on various cellular material is being utilized by neutrophils to kill bacterias or other microorganisms. Once the neutrophils phagocytize the bacterias there is rapid respiratory burst in the neutrophils which leads to increased oxygen consumption, glycogenolysis and increased glucose oxidation. These reactions lead to rapid burst of superoxide (and other. free radical) production as a by product of the oxidation. This rapid burst in oxidative respiration is made possible by the rapid activation of an enzyme complex, NADPH oxidase, which oxidizes NADPH and in the process reduces oxygen to superoxide anion (024 NADPH oxidase is an enzyme complex that consists of at least seven proteins. The enzyme consists of two complex ? a) Membrane complex b) Cytosolic complex In resting neutrophils various components of this enzyme complex is located in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. When the neutrophils are activated the enzyme complex shifts to the phagosomal membrane. The H202generated by the NADPH oxidase system is generally not able to efficiently kill microbes by itself However, azurophilic granules of neutrophils release the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) which in presence of halides such as Cl- conves 11202 to HOCL. The latter is a potent antimicrobial agent that destroys microbes by halogenation. The H202 - MPO halide system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils.",A

"All are true about warfarin, except -",It causes inhibition of vitamin K dependent clotting factors,T 1/2 36 hours,Crosses placenta,Dose is increased in liver disease,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Dose is increased in liver disease Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant. It acts by inhibiting vitamin K dependent coagulation factors.Other oral anticoagulants are -BishydroxycoumarinAcenocoumarinPhenindioneRole of vitamin K in coagulation:- Vitamin K is involved in the activation of clotting factors synthesized in the liver i.e. 77, VII, IX and X.These coagulation factors are originally synthesized as inactive precursor molecules.Formation of active clotting factor requires the vitamin K dependent carboxylation of glutamic acid residues present in these clotting factors.Mechanism of action of warfarinWarfarin is an indirectly acting anticoagulant i.e. it inhibits vitamin K which in turn inhibits coagulation factors.Vitamin K activates these factors by l carboxylation of their glutamate residues. While catalyzing this reaction vitamin K itself gets converted into its epoxide form from the hydroquinone form. Regeneration of hydroquinone form is required to resume the procoagulant activity of vitamin K. Oral anticoagulants prevent this regeneration, thus vitamin K dependent factors are not activated.* The effect of oral anticoagulant is not seen until the vitamin K dependent coagulation factors made before the drug was administered are cleared from the circulation.The process occurs at different rates for individual coagulation factors because each coagulation factor has different half life:- VII - 6 hoursIX and X - 24 hours Prothrombin - 72 hoursTherefore the effect of oral anticoagulant is always delayed (develops gradually over 1-3 days). Thus they are used for maintenance of anticoagulation rather than initiation of t/t. (If prompt anticoagulation is required heparin is used).'The t 1/2 of warfarin is 36 hr - 48 hr'Warfarin is a racemic mixture of approximately equal amounts of two isomers S (t 1/2 35h) and R (t 1/2 50h). 5 warfarin is four times more potent than R warfarin.Monitoring of warfarin therapy is done by prothrombin time and the result is expressed as the international normalized ratio (I.N.R.), which is the ratio of the prothrombin time in the patient to that in a normal anticoagulated person.Warfarin is well absorbed from the G.I.T. and it is highly plasma protein bound (99%). Its kinetics changes from first to zero order within therapeutic concentrations.Warfarin can cross the placenta and cause fetal warfarin syndrome. Therefore it is contraindicated in pregnancy. Patient is switched to heparin from warfarin during pregnancy.Adverse effects of warfarinBleedingCommon complication of warfarin therapy Skin necrosisIt occurs when induction of warfarin therapy is over abrupt and the patient has a genetically determined or acquired deficiency of the anticoagulant protein C or its cofactor protein S.RememberBesides activating coagulation factors vitamin K also activates certain anti-coagulant proteins such as proteins C and protein S.These anticoagulant proteins have shorter half-lives than regular coagulation factors.Thus when warfarin is administered the inhibitory effect of warfarin on coagulation factors is not manifested initially because of their long half-lives. Whereas, the inhibitory effect on anticoagulant proteins is manifested early because of their shorter half-lives.Thus a situation arises whereAnticoagulant effect is yet to be manifested (half-life of coagulation factors is long)Procoagulant effects are seen (half-life of anticoagulant protein is quite short)*Asa result OF procoagulant action, skin necrosis can develop.Teratogenic effect of warfarinWarfarin given in early pregnancy increases birth defects especially skeletal abnormalities i.e. -Foetal warfarin syndrome, i.e.Hypoplasia of nose, eye socket, hand bones andGrowth retardationGiven later in pregnancy it causesCNS defects,Foetal death andAccentuates neonatal hypothrombinemia Effect of liver disease on warfarinIn liver diseases the dose of oral anticoagulant needs to be decreased because in liver disease the hepatic synthesis of clotting factors is reduced. Thus there is already a deficiency of clotting factors (i.e. there is a preexisting anticoagulant state). Administration of warfarin in this state increases the risk of bleeding.Factors enhancing the effect of oral anticoagulants Liver disease, chronic alcoholism * Synthesis of clotting factors may be deficient.Debility, malnutrition, malabsorption and prolonged antibiotic therapySupply of vitamin K to liver is reduced in these condition.HyperthyroidismClotting factors are degraded faster.NewbornsHave low level of vitamin K and clotting factors.Factors decreasing the effect of oral anticoagulantsPregnancyPlasma level of clotting factors is higher Nephrotic syndromeDrug bound to plasma protein is lost in urine Genetic warfarin resistanceThe affinity of warfarin (as well as Vit.

Which protease inhibitor has boosting effect?,Amprenavir,Tenovir,Nelfinavir,Ritonavir,"Retroviral protease Inhibitors (Pis): An aspaic protease enzyme encoded by HIV is involved in the production of structural proteins and enzymes (including reverse transcriptase) of the virus. The large viral polyprotein is broken into various functional components by this enzyme. This protease acts at a late step in HIV replication, i.e. maturation of the new virus paicles when the RNA genome acquires the core proteins and enzymes. In case of different Pis, 6-18 tablets are to be taken daily, some on empty stomach, but others with meals; and this has to go on for months and years. Patient acceptability and compliance are often low. One of the strategies adopted to reduce the dose of IDV, LPV and SQV is to combine them with a lowand subtherapeutic dose (100 mg) of ritonavir. By reducing first pass metabolism, ritonavir increases the bioavailability of the companion PI. This &;boosted PI regimen&; permits reduction in the number I frequency of tablets to be taken each day. Lopinavir is marketed only in combination with ritonavir.

Which of the following conditions is associated with overexpression of bcl-2?,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Burkitt lymphoma,Follicular lymphoma,Multiple myeloma,"bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis; a (14;18) translocation resulting in overexpression of the bcl-2 protein in B lymphocytes causes apoptosis of neoplastic cells to be permanently inhibited, producing follicular lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma involves the lymph nodes and bone marrow of older people and is characterized by slow, but relentless, growth. Thus, this lymphoma allows a long survival even without any treatment. Indeed, follicular lymphoma is resistant to aggressive therapy because of its low mitotic activity. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a neoplasm of pre-B cells that affects children. Different molecular mechanisms probably account for different cases. Hyperdiploidy, the Philadelphia chromosome, t(12;21), and t(4;11) are variably found in patients with ALL. Burkitt lymphoma occurs in different clinical settings, including the African endemic, sporadic non endemic, and AIDS-associated forms. Histologically, all these forms are identical and are derived from neoplastic transformation of B cells expressing surface IgM. Common to all forms are translocations involving the c-myc oncogene (chromosome 8) and Ig loci (chromosome 14). These translocations lead to overexpression of c-myc, which encodes a nuclear transcription protein, resulting in sustained cell replication. The African form is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Multiple myeloma is a neoplasm of terminally differentiated B lymphocytes that secrete large amounts of monoclonal Ig or its fragments (light or heavy chains). Approximately 25% of cases have translocations that lead to overexpression of FGFR3, a receptor for fibroblast growth factor implicated in control of cell proliferation.",C

Lamotrigine has common side effects of:,Rash,Irritability,Nephrotoxicity,Behavioral disturbances,"Lamotrigine A new anticonvulsant having carbamazepine-like action profile: modifies maximal electroshock and decreases electrically evoked as well as photic after-discharge duration. Prolongation of Na+ channel inactivation and suppression of high frequency firing has been demonstrated. In addition, it may directly block voltage sensitive Na+ channels, thus stabilizing the presynaptic membrane and preventing release of excitatory neurotransmitters, mainly glutamate and aspaate. This may account for its broader-spectrum of antiseizure efficacy. However, it does not antagonize PTZ seizures or block NMDA type of glutamate receptors Lamotrigine is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic. Initially found useful as add-on therapy in refractory cases of paial seizures and GTCS, it has now been shown effective as monotherapy as well. Absence and myoclonic or akinetic epilepsy cases have also been successfully treated. Reduction in seizure frequency or complete control is obtained as frequently as with carbamazepine. Lamotrigine is well absorbed orally and metabolized completely in liver. Its t half is 24 hr, but is reduced to -16 hr in patients receiving phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbitone. On the contrary valproate inhibits glucuronidation of lamotrigine and doubles its blood level, but valproate levels are lowered by lamotrigine. Reduce the dose of lamotrigine to half in patients taking valproate. However, metabolism of other anticonvulsants and oral contraceptives is not altered. Side effects are sleepiness, dizziness, diplopia, ataxia and vomiting. In some comparative trials lamotrigine has been found to be better tolerated than carbamazepine or phenytoin.

The reticulocytes are larger RBCs that slightly increase the MCV. Anaplastic marrow is very hypocellular and unable to respond to anemia; it is associated with pancytopenia.

Iron deficiency anemia is typically microcytic and hypochromic but could be partially masked here by reticulocytosis, which would not be as marked if iron were not available, but his diet is supplying needed iron. Infiltrative disorders, such as metastases in the marrow, would impair the ability to mount reticulocytosis of this degree.",C

Levodopa can cause-,Spasticity,Tremor,Akinesia,On-off phenomenon,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., On-off phenomenon On-off phenomenon in Parkinsonism In parkinsonism the motor symptoms remain stabilized 2-3 years after therapy. o But after 2-3 years of levodopa therapy the effect of the drug gradually begins to wear offi.e., the motor symptoms begins to appear. This is also called 'end of dose' deterioration. o After some period of time, the motor symptoms begins to appear frequently. This is called 'switches' or 'on-off effect. o With time 'all or none' response develops i.e., the patient is alternately well and disabled. o This 'on-off' phenomenon is probably a reflection of the progression of the disorder. With progressive degeneration of dopamine neurones, the ability of the drug to regulate the storage and release of Dopamine may be lost. Dopamine is then synthesized in the striatum on a moment to moment basis. This results in appearance of symptoms.",D
What is the mode of action of Sodium Cromoglycate?,Mast cell stabilization,Antihistaminic,Anticholinergic,None of the above,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Mast cell stabilization Mast cell stabilizer Mast cells are the major source of inflammatory mediators in asthma. Therefore, the drugs which prevent degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators of mast cells can be used for long term prophylaxis in mild to moderate asthma. These drugs are ineffective in acute attack of asthma as degranulation of mast cells with release of inflammatory mediators has already occured. Sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil are mast cell stabilizers. Nedocromil has additional antihistaminic action, thus it is especially indicated in patient with multiple disorders (asthma, atopic dermatitis, conjuctivitis, rhinitis, uicaria and food allergy).

Metronidazole (Ref: Goodman Gillman I2/e p1512,1542.1407, Katzung 12/e p824)Metronidazole does not cause hearing loss.'All aminoglycosides are ototoxic and nephrotoxic. Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are more likely to be encountered when therapy is continued for more than 5 days, at higher doses, in the elderly, and in the setting of renal insufficiency. Concurrent use with loop diuretics (eg, furosemide, ethacrynic acid) or other nephrotoxic antimicrobial agents (eg. vancomycin or amphotericin) can potentiate nephrotoxicity and should be avoided if possible. Neomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin are the most ototoxic agents. Streptomycin and gentamicin are the most vestibulotoxic, bleomycin, tobramycin, and gentamicin are the most nephrotoxic. --Katzung 12/e p824'Vestibular and auditory dysfunction can follow the administration of any of the aminoglycosides, and ototoxicity may become a dose-limiting adverse effect. Aminoglycoside induced ototoxicity results in irreversible, bilateral high-frequency hearing loss and temporary vestibular hypofunction.

The most common cause of 'pro-lymphomatous' inflammation in the stomach is chronic H. pylori infection, which is found in association with most cases of gastric MALToma.The most striking evidence linking H. pylori gastritis to MALToma is that eradication of the infection with infection with antibiotics induces durable remissions with low rates of recurrence in most patients.",D
Nevirapine -,NNRTI,PI,NRTI,Entry Inhibitor,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., NNRTI Antiretroviral-classificationo Here I am giving brief introduction about the steps of replication of HIV genome so that you can better understand the mechanism of action of various anti-retroviral drugs :-Fusion:- First there is binding of HIV virus with host cells (mainly CDTTcells). Gpl20 ofvirus interact with CD4 receptor of host cells. After fusion (binding) virus gets entry (in preintegration complex form) in the host cells. This step is inhibited by fusion inhibitors, also called entry inhibitors.Reverse transcription :- As the preintegration complex (virus) traverses the cytoplasm to reach the host nucleus, the viral reverse transcriptase catalyses the reverse transcription of the viral RNA into DNA. This step is inhibited by reverse transcriptase inhibitors.Integration :-After reverse transcription, viral DNA (synthesized from reverse transcription of RNA) is inte grated into the host chromosome by virus integrase (has endonuclease activity). This step is inhibited byIntegrase inhibitors.Replication (Transcription & translation) :-Viral DNA replicate with host genome and transcripts to form mRNA which is translated into protein. These proteins are inactive viron.Post- translational modification :- Inactive virion is transformed into active virion by post-translational modi- fication, a step catalysed by protease. This step is inhibited by protease inhibitors.The active virion is released from the host cell, which then is available to infect other host cells.Antiretroviral drugsNucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTls) -Zidovudin, Didanosine, Zalcitabine, Stavudine, Lami\mdine,,4PS>><<c<<vr>.Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor - Tenofovir (Katzung 1 CP/e)Nonucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIS) - Nevirapine, Efavirenz, Delavirdine.

Which is NOT pyrogenic Interleukin,IL-1,TNF-a,IL-4,IL-6,"(C) IL-4 # Pyrogenic cytokines: Known pyrogenic cytokines include IL-1, IL-6, TNF, ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), and interferon (INF)a. Others probably exist; although IL-18 - a membrane of the IL-1 family - does not appear to be pyrogenic cytokine. Each cytokine is encoded by a separate gene, and each pyrogenic cytokine has been shown to cause fever in laboratory animals and in humans. When injected into humans, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF produce fever at low doses (10 to 100 ng/kg).> Fever, characterized by an elevation of body temperature, usually by 1deg to 4degC, is one of the most prominent manifestations of the acute-phase response, especially when inflammation is caused by infection. Fever is produced in response to substances called pyrogens that act by stimulating prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in the vascular and perivascular cells of the hypothalamus. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS; called exogenous pyrogens), stimulate leukocytes to release cytokines such as IL-1 & TNF (called endogenous pyrogens) that increase the levels of cyclooxygenases that convert AA into prostaglandins. In the hypothalamus the PGs, especially PGE2, stimulate the production of neurotransmitters, which function to reset the temperature set point at a higher level. IL-4 is involved in immediate hypersensitivity reactions.",C

An important step in activation of naive CD4 +T cells and initiation of cell-mediated immune response is played by Interleukin-,2,1,3,4,"Activation of CD4 +T cells:

Naive CD4 +T cells cells recognize peptides displayed by dendritic cells and secrete IL-2, which functions as an autocrine growth factor to stimulate proliferation of the antigen-responsive T cells.
The subsequent differentiation of antigen-stimulated T cells to TH1 or TH17 cells is driven by the cytokines produced by APCs at the time of T-cell activation.
In some situations, the APCs (dendritic cells and macrophages) produce 1L-12, which induces the differentiation of CD4 +T cells to the TH1 subset. IFN-γ produced by these effector cells promotes further TH1 development, thus amplifying the reaction.
If the APCs produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and a close relative of IL-12 called IL-23, these stimulate differentiation of T cells to the TH17 subset.",A

Wound contraction is mediated by –,Epithelial cells,Collagen,Myofibroblasts,Elastin,"'Perhaps the feature that most clearly differentiates primary from secondary healing is the phenomenon of wound contraction, which occurs in large surface wounds. Permanent wound contraction requires the action of myofibroblasts— altered fibroblasts that have the ultrastructural characteristics of smooth muscle cells. Contraction of these cells at the wound site decreases the gap between the dermal edges of the wound'- Robbins 7th/113
Healing By First Intention (Wounds With Opposed Edges) Robbins 7th/all-113
□ The least complicated example of wound repair is the healing of a clean, uninfected surgical incision approximated by surgical sutures. Such healing is referred to as primary union or healing by the first intention.
□ The narrow incisional space immediately fills with clotted blood containing fibrin and blood cells; dehydration of the surface clot forms the well-known scab that covers the wound.
□ Within 24 hours, neutrophils (Polymorphonuclear leukocytes) appear at the margins of the incision, moving toward the fibrin clot.
□ In 24 to 48 hours, spurs of epithelial cells move from the wound edges (with little cell proliferation) along the cut margins of the dermis, depositing basement membrane components as they move.
□ By day 3, the neutrophils have been largely replaced by macrophages. Granulation tissue progressively invades the incision space.
□ By day 5, the incisional space is filled with granulation tissue. Neovascularization is maximal
□ During the second week, there is continued accumulation of collagen and proliferation of fibroblasts The leukocytic infiltrate, edema, and increased vascularity have largely disappeared.
□ By the end of the first month, the scar is made up of a cellular connective tissue devoid of inflammatory infiltrate, covered now by the intact epidermis.",C

All of the following are true regarding vancomycin except: September 2009,Excreted unchanged mainly by glomerular filtration,Poorly distributed in the body fluids,May cause red man syndrome,Not absorbed orally,"Ans. B: Poorly distributed in the body fluids Vancomycin undergoes limited absorption when administered orally and is therefore restricted to parenteral administration for the treatment of systemic infections. It is distributed widely to various tissues and body fluids. Penetration of vancomycin may vary by site and concomitant disease states. For example, limited CSF penetration may be enhanced by the presence of inflamed meninges. The orable penetration of vancomycin into skin tissues may be significantly impaired in patients with diabetes. Vancomycin penetration into lung epithelial lining fluid is limited relative to that of simultaneous serum concentration (the ratio of lung tissue to serum concentration is about 0.25). Vancomycin's primary route of elimination is renal excretion of unchanged drug. The rate of elimination is directly related to creatinine clearance.

For pediatric patients, the treatment options are the same as for adults except the drug dose is adjusted by patient weight. The pediatric dose should never exceed the recommended adult dose. Pediatric dosing may be difficult due to unavailability of non-capsule forms of quinine. If unable to provide pediatric doses of quinine, consider one of the other three options. If using a quinine-based regimen for children less than eight years old, doxycycline and tetracycline are generally not indicated; therefore, quinine can be given alone for a full 7 days regardless of where the infection was acquired or given in combination with clindamycin as recommended above. In rare instances, doxycycline or tetracycline can be used in combination with quinine in children less than 8 years old if other treatment options are not available or are not tolerated, and the benefit of adding doxycycline or tetracycline is judged to outweigh the risk. If infections initially attributed to 'species not identified' are subsequently diagnosed as being due to P. vivax or P. ovale, additional treatment with primaquine should be administered.

All of the following are true regarding adverse effects of chlorpropamide except: March 2010,Sensitizes the kidney to ADH action,Less incidence of hypoglycemia,More incidence of weight gain,Disulfiram like reaction may occur,"Ans. B: Less incidence of hypoglycemia Chlorpropamide is a long-acting sulphonylurea. It has more side effects than other sulphonylureas and its use is no longer recommended. Like other sulphonylureas, chlorpropamide acts to increase the secretion of insulin, so it is only effective in patients who have some pancreatic beta cell function. It can cause relatively long episodes of hypoglycemia; this is one reason why shoer-acting sulfonylureas such as gliclazide or tolbutamide are used instead. The risk of hypoglycemia makes this drug a poor choice for the elderly and patients with mild to moderate hepatic and renal impairment. Chlorpropamide and other sulphonylureas encourage weight gain, so they are generally not ored for use in very obese patients. Metformin is considered a better drug for these patients. Sulfonylureas should be avoided in patients with hepatic and renal impairment, patients with porphyria, patients who are breastfeeding, and patients with ketoacidosis. Not indicated for patients more than 65 years of age. It may cause facial flushing after the ingestion of alcohol. It may increase secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which can lead to hyponatremia.",B

Pink’s disease is due to toxicity of:,Silver,Mercury,Lead,Tetracycline,"ACRODYNIA (Pink disease, Swift's disease)

Cause of the disease has been established as a mercurial toxicity reaction, either actual mercury poisoning or more likely, an idiosyncrasy to the metal.
The source of the mercury is usually a teething powder, ammoniated mercury ointment, calomel lotion, or bichloride of mercury disinfectant.
Occurs most frequently in young infants before the age of two years, although children are occasionally affected upto the age of five or six years.
The skin, particularly of the hands, feet, nose, ears and cheeks becomes red or pink and has a cold 'clammy feeling'.
The appearance has been described as resembling raw beef.
The skin over the affected areas peels frequently.

Rubella is rare with routine vaccinations. Folate deficiency is most likely to be associated with neural tube defects. Dispermy is rare and can lead to triploidy, a condition that rarely results in a live birth. Erythroblastosis fetalis leads to fetal anemia with congestive heart failure and hydrops, but not to malformations.

A peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes, helmet-shaped cells, and cells with a triangular shape. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Autoimmune hemolytic anemia,Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS),Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. It is characterized by an increased bleeding time but a decreased platelet count. It causes purpura, fever, renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and microthrombi, frequently in young women. Elevated indirect bilirubin and high LDH are characteristic, as are schistocytes in the blood smear, renal dysfunction, and neurologic and systemic symptoms. Negative findings impoant to rule out similar conditions include a negative Coombs test and absence of fibrin split products. TTP is thought to be initiated by endothelial injury, which releases ceain procoagulant materials into the circulation, causing platelet aggregation. This condition may be precipitated by pregnancy or use of estrogens. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia can cause anemia and an elevated indirect bilirubin, but generally produces only mild symptoms, is not associated with thrombocytopenia, and does not cause fragmentation of red blood cells on the peripheral smear. The negative Coombs test argues against autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be differentiated from TTP because of abnormal coagulation tests. In DIC, microangiopathic hemolysis is also present, but the prothrombin time (PT) and paial thromboplastin time (PTT) are prolonged, fibrinogen levels are reduced, and fibrin split products are elevated. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is not significantly different from TTP. The two conditions, in fact, are considered manifestations of the same pathogenetic spectrum.

What is not associated with DIC -,Thrombocytopenia,Increased PT,Hyperfibrinogenemia,Increased FDP,"Plasma fibrinogen levels are reduced due to consumption in microvascular coagulation by which intravascular clotting occurs. Reference to earlier comments on normal blood coagulation (Chapter 3) may be helpful at this point. It suffices here to recall that clotting can be initiated by either the extrinsic pathway, which is triggered by the release of tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin); or the intrinsic pathway, which involves the activation of factor XII by surface contact, collagen, or other negatively charged substances. Both pathways lead to the generation of throm- bin. Clotting normally is limited by the rapid clearance of activated clotting factors by the macrophages and the liver, endogenous anticoagulants (e.g., protein C), and the con- comitant activation of fibrinolysis. DIC usually is triggered by either (1) the release of tissue factor or thromboplastic substances into the circulation or (2) widespread endothelial cell damage (Fig. 11-28). Throm- boplastic substances can be released into the circulation from a variety of sources--for example, the placenta in obstetric complications or ceain types of cancer cells, paicularly those of acute promyelocytic leukemia and adenocarcino- mas. Cancer cells can also provoke coagulation in other ways, such as by releasing proteolytic enzymes and by expressing tissue factor. In gram-negative and gram-positive sepsis (impoant causes of DIC), endotoxins or exotoxins stimu- late the release of tissue factor from monocytes. Activated monocytes also release IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor, both of which stimulate the expression of tissue factor on endo- thelial cells and simultaneously decrease the expression of thrombomodulin. The latter, you may recall, activates protein C, an anticoagulant (Chapter 3). The net result of these alterations is the enhanced generation of thrombin and the blunting of inhibitory pathways that limit coagulation. Severe endothelial cell injury can initiate DIC by causing the release of tissue factor and by exposing subendothelial col- lagen and von Willebrand factor (vWF). However, even subtle forms of endothelial damage can unleash procoagulant activity by stimulating the increased expression of tissue factor on endothelial cell surfaces. Widespread endothelial injury can be produced by the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes (e.g., in systemic lupus erythematosus), by tem- perature extremes (e.g., after heat stroke or burn injury), or by infections (e.g., due to meningococci or rickettsiae). As discussed in Chapter 3, endothelial injury is an impoant consequence of endotoxemia, and, not surprisingly, DIC is a frequent complication of gram-negative sepsis. Disorders associated with DIC are listed in Table 11-12. Of these, DIC is most often associated with sepsis, obstetric complications, malignancy, and major trauma (especially trauma to the brain). The initiating events in these conditions are multiple and often interrelated. For example, in obstetric conditions, tissue factor derived from the placenta, retained dead fetus, or amniotic fluid enters the circulation; however, shock, hypoxia, and acidosis often coexist and can lead to widespread endothelial injury. Trauma to the brain releases fat and phospholipids, which act as contact factors and thereby activate the intrinsic arm of the coagulation cascade. Whatever the pathogenetic mechanism, DIC has two con- sequences. First, there is widespread fibrin deposition within the microcirculation. The associated obstruction leads to ischemia in the more severely affected or vulnerable organs and hemolysis as red cells are traumatized while passing through vessels narrowed by fibrin thrombi (micro- angiopathic hemolytic anemia). Second, a bleeding diathesis results from the depletion of platelets and clotting factors and the secondary release of plasminogen activators. Plasmin cleaves not only fibrin (fibrinolysis) but also factors V and VIII, thereby reducing their concentration fuher. In addition, fibrinolysis creates fibrin degradation products. These inhibit platelet aggregation, have antithrombin activity, and impair fibrin polymerization, all of which contribute to the hemostatic failure (Fig. 11-28).

Lack of differentiation is called -,Anaplasia,Dysplasia,Metaplasia,Hyperplasia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Anaplasia First I would like to explain following frequently asked terms ? Differentiation Differentiation refers to the process by which a less specialized cell (immature) becomes a more specialized (mature) cell type, to perform a specific function. o All specialized cells are derived from stem cells that can give rise to various type of cells. o For example, hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow can give rise to red blood cells, or WBCs, or platelets through various stages of development. o This process of development from stem cells to mature cells is differentiation. So, in differentiation cells acquire a type. o For neoplastic cells, differentiation refers to the extent to which neoplastic cells resemble comparabale to normal cells, both morphologically and functionally -3 well differentiated cells resemble to normal cells, while undifferentiated cells do not resemble at all, poorly differentiated cells paially resemble to normal cells. Polarity It means orientation and organization of cells in a tissue, i.e. correct positioning of cells in a tissue. Pleomorphism o Pleomorphism is variation in size and shape. It may occur in cells or / and nuclei. Hyperchromatasia o Nuclei contain an abundance of DNA and are extremely dark staining --> hyperchromatic nuclei. Anaplasia o Anaplasia means lack of differentiation. o It means 'to form backward', implying a reversion from a high level of differentiation to a lower level. o This does not mean that the differentiation takes place in reverse direction, i.e. from mature specialized cells to unspecialized stem cells. o Rather, Anaplasia arise from stem cells that proliferate without differentiation (maturation). o So, anaplastic cells resemble primitive-appearing unspecialized cells. o Anaplasia is seen in malignant tumors --) Anaplasia is considered a hallmark of malignant transformation. o But, It is not necessory that all malignant tumors are anaplastic (undifferentiated or poorly differentiated) some malignant tumors may be well differentiated, eg follicular carcinoma of thyroid.",A

Heparin treatment is monitored by:,aPTT,PT,CT,BT,"Ans: A (aPTT) Ref: The Pharmacological basis of therapeutics by Good man & Gilman - 12th edition, page no. 855-857Explanation:Heparin treatment is monitored using activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)An aPTT two to three times the normal mean aPTT value generally is therapeutic.Prothrombin time (International Normalized Ratio) is used to monitor warfarin therapy.The low molecular weight heparin such as enoxaparin and tinzaparin and fondaparinux do not require aPTT monitoring as with unfractionated heparin. Hence they can be administered even for out-of -hospital management.Another advantage with LMYV heparin is that they can be given by subcutaneous injection once or twice daily.Heparin and fondaparinux are mainly used in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism.Fondaparinux is a factor Xa inhibitor, which also has the same advantages of LMW - subcutaneous injection, no need of lab monitoring.Fondaparinux should not be used in the setting of angioplasty as it has a greater risk of catheter thrombosis.Anticoagulation ibn pregnancy is best managed with UFH, LMW heparin and fondaparinux since they do not cross placenta to cause fetal malformations as seen with warfarin.Fondaparinux is least likely to cause thrombocytopenia among the anti-coagulants.Heparin is preferred in CABG surgery since protamine sulfate can be used to neutralize its effects following procedure.",A

Most serious adverse effect of ketoconazole is:,Adrenal insufficiency,Pellagra like skin lesion,Liver injury,Prostate cancer,"Ketoconazole (KTZ): It is the first orally effective broad-spectrum antifungal drug, useful in both dermatophytosis and deep myc osis. The oral absorption of KTZ is facilitated by gastric acidity because it is more soluble at lower pH. Hepatic metabolism is extensive; metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces. Elimination of KTZ is dose dependent: tlh varies from llh to 6 hours. Penetration in CSF is poor: not effective in fungal men ingitis. However, therapeutic concentrations are attained in the skin and vaginal fluid. Adverse effects Ketoconazole is much less toxic than AMB, but more side effects occur than with itraconazole or fluconazole, that have largely replaced it for systemic use. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting; can be reduced by giving the drug with meals. Others are-loss of appetite, headache, paresthesia, rashes and hair loss. Ketoconazole decreases androgen production from testes, and it displaces testosterone from protein binding sites. Gynaecomastia, loss of hair and libido, and oligozoospermia may be themanifestations. Menstrual irregularities occur in some women due to suppression of estradiol synthesis. A dose-dependent decrease in serum hydro coisone due to synthesis inhibition has also been noticed, but without any clinical manifestations in normal individuals.

Multiple sinuses from infection of great toe is mainly caused by:September 2007,Tuberculosis,Actinomycetes,Trichosporum,Histoplasmosis,"Ans. B: ActinomycetesMycetoma is a chronic localized granulomatous inflammatory lesion common in the tropics and sub-tropics.Multiple siAuses, soft tissue swelling and discharge of coloured granules characterize a mycetoma foot. Chronic sinuses discharging granules are caused by (1) Eumycetes (true fungi), (2) Schizomycetes, which includesActinomycosis (aerobic higher filamentous bacteria) andBotryomycosis (bacterial infection).- Actinomycosis is often caused by Actinomadura or Nocardia species wherein it gains entry after penetrating trauma (splinter, gravel or thorn prick).Young males are commonly affected and 75% of the lesions occur in the lower limbs.The disease slowly progresses from a nodule to multiple sinuses discharging coloured granules. Involvement of bone is late following dermal and soft tissue spread.- Botryomycosis (a misnomer), a chronic suppurative infection is caused by bacteria involving skin or viscera . This rare condition mimics a deep mycotic infection and is often caused by Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas species of bacteria. The feet and hands are commonly affected and penetrating trauma may be a predisposing factor. It usually presents as a nodule, sinus or ulcer, which is initially localized.The diagnosis of actinomycosis is based on clinical findings, demonstration of characteristic granules and culture of the organism from a deep tissue biopsy.Immunological studies (counter immuno electrophoresis and ELISA) are also used. Botryomycosis is diagnosed based on a positive gram's stain and culture; negative fungal cultures and demonstration of the characteristic botryomycotic granules at histopathology from a deep biopsy.In endemic areas, subcutaneous swelling with sinuses should be considered as mycetoma unless proved otherwise.

Parameter which should be tested before staing heparin therapy: September 2011,Serum bleeding time,Serum clotting time,Prothrombin time,Activated paial thromboplastin time,"Ans. D: Activated paial thromboplastin time Monitoring of heparin therapy is done by either whole blood clotting time (kept 2-3 times the normal) or activated paial thromboplastin time (kept upto 1.5-2 times the normal) Paial thromboplastin time/ PTT/ activated paial thromboplastin time (aPTT/ APTT It is a performance indicator measuring the efficacy of both the 'intrinsic' (now referred to as the contact activation pathway) and the common coagulation pathways. Apa from detecting abnormalities in blood clotting, it is also used to monitor the treatment effects with heparin, a major anticoagulant. It is used in conjunction with the prothrombin time (PT) which measures the extrinsic pathway. Kaolin cephalin clotting time (KccT) is a historic name for the activated paial thromboplastin time Blood samples are collected in tubes with oxalate or citrate to arrest coagulation by binding calcium. The specimen is then delivered to the laboratory. In order to activate the intrinsic pathway, phospholipid, an activator (such as silica, celite, kaolin, ellagic acid), and calcium (to reverse the anticoagulant effect of the oxalate) are mixed into the plasma sample . The time is measured until a thrombus (clot) forms. The test is termed 'paial' due to the absence of tissue factor from the reaction mixture The typical reference range is between 25 seconds and 39 s (depending on laboratory). Shoening of the PTT has little clinical relevance. Normal PTT times require the presence of the following coagulation factors: I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Notably, deficiencies in factors VII or XIII will not be detected with the PTT test. Prolonged APTT may indicate: - Use of heparin (or contamination of the sample) - Antiphospholipid antibody (especially lupus anticoagulant, which paradoxically increases propensity to thrombosis) - Coagulation factor deficiency (e.g. hemophilia) To distinguish the above causes, mixing tests are performed, in which the patient's plasma is mixed (initially at a 50:50 dilution) with normal plasma. If the abnormality does not disappear, the sample is said to contain an 'inhibitor' (either heparin, antiphospholipid antibodies or coagulation factor specific inhibitors), while if it does correct a factor deficiency is more likely. Deficiencies of factors VIII, IX, XI and XII and rarely von Willebrand factor (if causing a low factor VIII level) may lead to a prolonged aPTT correcting on mixing studies.",D

Abnormality to check if lithium is given to a pregnant female -,Cardiac anomaly,Neural tube defect,Facial defect,Urogenital defect,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Cardiac anomaly Lithium is a weak teratogen in human.The main effects attributable to lithium are increased cardiac malformation in the fetus especially 'Ebsteins anomaly'.Lithium may increase the incidence of Ebstein9s anomaly in fetus but it is not contraindicated during pregnancy.Lithium is not considered a major human teratogen and the risk for Ebstein's anomaly is only .5% for babies whose mother takes lithium during pregnancy.Therefore lithium is not contraindicated during pregnancy. It is however advisable to perform a 'fetal echocardiography' to exclude the possibilities of cardiac anomaly.Evaluation of studies on lithium in pregnancy shows that lithium therapy throughout pregnancy does not seem to increase the general rate of major anomalies and apparently add only a small risk for cardiovascular defects notably Ebstein's anomaly.It can be concluded that whenever lithium is the drug of choice in women with bipolar disorder, it may be continued even in pregnancy.Moreover it is advised not to discontinue lithium as it may subsequently lead to relapse of the disorder.In addition, pregnancy of lithium treated women should be considered high risk and therefore monitoring during pregnancy has to include 'fetal echocardiography'.Pregnancy interruption in lithium treated mothers can probably be considered only if severe cardiac anomaly is diagnosed.According to K.D.T.Lithium is contraindicated during pregnancy.But all other books states that lithium can be administered is during pregnancy.",A

The group of antibiotics that possesses additional anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory  activities is:,Tetracyclines,Polypeptide antibiotics,Macrolides,Fluoroquinolones,"MACROLIDE ANTIBIOTICS
These are antibiotics having a macrocyclic lactone ring with attached sugars. Erythromycin is the first member discovered in the 1950s. Roxithromycin, Clarithromycin and Azithromycin are the later additions.
Interestingly, the nonantibiotic macrolides: tacrolimus, pimecrolimus and sirolimus also possess immunomodulatory properties. The antibiotic effects of macrolides are mediated by inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis, through inhibition of peptidyltransferase activity. They have been frequently used in the past for treating many upper respiratory tract infections including GAS pharyngitis with adequate efficacy (>90%). Their effects on immunomodulation appear to extend beyond their antimicrobial actions as they have been shown to mitigate cytokine production in animal studies and human trials.
While its antibiotic properties have been attributed to mechanisms shared by other macrolides, AZM has been shown to act primarily on the lymphokine CD4 Th1 cell line reducing the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-6, and increasing the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in macrophage cell lines after stimulation with a combination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-γ. The immunomodulatory potential of AZM is not limited to suppression of production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, it also suppresses iNOS-mediated nitric oxide production. These agents also work at a molecular level, decreasing mRNA expression thereby promoting apoptosis of inflammatory cells and a decrease in nuclear transcription factors.",C

The primary function of Toll like Receptors is?-,Vasodilation,Activation of Immune System,Regulation of Calcium channel,Second Messenger,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are microbial sensors that are named for the founding member called Toll, which was discovered in Drosophila. There are ten mammalian TLRs, which recognize products of bacteria (such as endotoxin and bacterial DNA), viruses (such as double-stranded RNA), and other pathogens . TLRs are located in plasma membranes and endosomes, so they are able to detect extracellular and ingested microbes. They are complemented by cytoplasmic and membrane molecules, from several other families, that also recognize microbial products. TLRs and the other receptors recognize products of different types of microbes and thus provide defense against essentially all classes of infectious pathogens. Recognition of microbes by these receptors activates transcription factors that stimulate the production of a number of secreted and membrane proteins. These proteins include mediators of inflammation, antiviral cytokines (interfer-ons), and proteins that promote lymphocyte activation and even more potent immune responses.

"A 25yr old women with myoclonic seizures is well controlled on valproate. she indicates that she is intrested in conceiving in next year. With respect to her antiepileptic medication, wof should be considered",Leave her on current therapy,Switch to lamotrigine,Decrease valproate dose,None of the above,"Lamotrigine Mech of action:- Lamotrigine is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic. It modifies maximal electric shock and decreases electrically evoked as well as photic after-discharge duration. Prolongation of Na+ channel inactivation and suppression of high frequency firing has been demonstrated. In addition, it may directly block voltage sensitive Na+ channels, thus stabilizing the presynaptic membrane and preventing release of excitatory neurotransmitters, mainly glutamate and aspaate. This may account for its broader-spectrum of antiseizure efficacy. uses:- Absence and myoclonic or akinetic epi-lepsy cases have also been successfully treated. Reduction in seizure frequency or complete control is obtained as frequently as with carbamazepine. Pharmacokinetics:- Lamotrigine is well absorbed orally and metabolized completely in liver. Its t 1/2 is 24 hr, but is reduced to ~16 hr in patients receiving phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbitone. On the contrary valproate inhibits glucuronidation of lamotrigine and doubles its blood level, but valproate levels are lowered by lamotrigine. Reduce the dose of lamotrigine to half in patients taking valproate. However, metabolism of other anticonvulsants and oral contraceptives is not altered. Ref:- kd tripathi;pg num:-419",B

ENaC mutation is associated with,Liddle syndrome,Gordon syndrome,Baer syndrome,Giltleman syndrome,"ENac (Epithelial sodium channel)*ENac is a sodium transpo channel that is produced in the apical surface of all exocrine epithelial cells (All tracts and ducts)*The channel absorbs sodium from the luminal secretions and sent it back to the circulation thus maintaining the sodium level in blood and hence normal blood pressure.*Mutation of this ENaC channel will cause loss of sodium through luminal secretions and causes hyponatremia and hypovolemia. This in turn stimulates Renin angiotensin system causing hypeension through aldosterone. This condition is called 'Liddle syndrome'*ENac is downregulated by CFTR gene in normal individuals. In cystic fibrosis, loss of CFTR causes increased expression of ENaC in all the tracts and ducts except sweat ducts.

True statement about a pralidoxime is,Signs of atropinization occur more slowly when pralidoxime is used as compared to the use of atropine alone,It can be used defect chlorinated pesticides,It should not used for nerve gases used in chemical warfare,Therapy with pralidoxime should ideally be monitored by measuring blood chlolinesterase concentration,"(Rf: KDT 6/e p105, Drug facts and comparison2010/599) Pralidoxime is ACh esterase reactivator used for organophosphate poisoning. Blood cholinesterase levels can be used to monitor therapy, however RBC cholinesterase levels better reflect ACh esterase activity than serum or plasma levels because with chronic exposire to organo-phosphates, serum levels may return to normal but RBC levels remain depressed. Chlorinated pesticides like DDT are CNS stimulants and their overdose is treated by diazepam like drugs. Pralidoxime has no role in their treatment. Nerve gases used in warfare act bv inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. Atropine and oximes are used for their treatment. When atropine and pralidoxime are used together, the signs of atropinization may occur earlier than might be expected when atropine is used alone.",D

Red reaction in triple response is due to: March 2011,Local edema,Capillary dilation,Axon reflex,Decreased permeability of capillaries,"Ans. B: Capillary dilation Red reaction or red line in triple reaction is due to dilatation of precapillary sphincters Triple response of Lewis It is a cutaneous response that occurs from firm stroking of the skin, which produces an initial red line, followed by a flare around that line, and then finally a wheal. The triple response of Lewis is due to the release of histamine. Histamine, or 2-(imidazol-4-yl) ethanamine, is a dibasic vasoactive amine that is located in most body tissues but is highly concentrated in the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Histamine is derived from the decarboxylation of the aminoacid histidine, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme Lhistidine decarboxylase. Histamine is a small molecule, stored as granules in mast cells and basophils. Mast cells and basophils are the effector cells involved in the immediate hypersensitivity response. Explanation :Injected intradermally histamine elicits the triple response consisting of: - Red spot: due to capillary dilation - Flare: redness in the surrounding area due to aeriolar dilatation mediated by axon reflex. - Wheal: due to exudation of fluid from capillaries and venules",B

Virchow's triad for thrombosis include all except ?,Stasis,Endothelial injury,Hypercoagulability,platelet thrombis,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Platelet thrombus Thrombosis o Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) inside a blood vessel or hea, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system. Then what is the difference between formation of normal hemostatic plug and thrombosis ? o When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses platelet and fibrin to form a blood clot as the first step to prevent blood loss --> hemostasis. o If that mechanism causes too much doting, a thrombus is formed i.e., exaggeration of hemostatic process leads to thrombus formation. o In other terms, hemostasis is a self limited process i.e., there is spontaneous resolution of hemostatic plug with subsequent repair of the injury, while thrombosis is not self limited and the thrombotic clot does not undergo resolution spontaneously rather it causes obstruction to blood flow. o Thrombosis may occur without injury (e.g., in hypercoagulable state), while hemostatic plug is formed only after injury. Pathogenesis of thrombosis o Thrombosis is caused by abnormalities in one or more of the following three (Virchow's triad) :? Vascular (endothelial) injury. Abnormal blood flow (stasis or turbulence). Blood hypercoagulability. How do these mechanisms lead to thrombosis? o Endothelial injury with formation of clot has already been explained earlier. o Blood hypercoagulability, as the name suggests, there is increase tendency of clot formation due to alteration in coagulation pathway that predisposes to thrombus. It may occur in many primary (genetic) or secondary (acquired) conditions. o Disturbances in blood flow Stasis Stasis is the major factor in the development of venous thrombus. Turbulence contributes to aerial and cardiac thrombosis. Normal blood flow is laminar such that the platelets flow centrally in the vessel lumen, separated from the endothelium by a slower-moving clear zone of plasma. Stasis and turbulence leads to thrombosis by ? Disruption of laminar flow brings platelets into contact with endothelium. Prevent dilution of activated clotting factors by fresh flowing blood.

Over time, this patient's right kidney is likely to demonstrate which of the following morphologic adaptations to paial ischaemia?",Atrophy,Dysplasia,Hyperplasia,Hyperophy,"The answer is A: Atrophy. Interference with blood supply to tissues is known as ischemia. Total ischemia results in cell death. Paial ischemia occurs after incomplete occlusion of a blood vessel or in areas of inadequate collateral circulation. This results in a chronically reduced oxygen supply, a condition often compatible with continued cell bility. Under such circumstances, cell atrophy is common.

Edema in nephrotic syndrome is due to aEUR',Na and water restriction,Increased venous pressure,Hypoalbuminemia,Hyperlipidemia,Hypoalbuminemia Edema is one of the major clinical manifestations of nephritic syndrome. Two major factors have been thought to be responsible for this problem and it is likely that both contribute to a variable decree in individual patients. i) Low colloid oncotic pressure :? - In nephrotic syndrome the initial event is a derangement in the capillary walls of glomeruli resulting in increased permeability to plasma proteins. - The increased permeability allows protein to escape from plasma to glomerular filtrate. Long standing loss of protein leads to hypoalbuntinemia. - The loss of protein (albumin) leads to reduced colloid oncotic pressure. Fluids are held in the intravascular compament because of the colloid oncotic pressure. When the colloid oncotic pressure is reduced the fluid cannot be retained in the intravascular compament and moves out in the interstitial fluid producing edema. ii)Sodium retention directly induced by renal disease.,C

"Growth retardation, skeletal deformities and hemosiderosis are characteristic features of which of the following disorders?",β-Thalassemia major,α-Thalassemia trait,β-Thalassemia minor,G6PD deficiency,"β-thalassemia trait and α-thalassemia trait are typically asymptomatic.
The anatomic changes in β-thalassemia major are similar in kind to those seen in other hemolytic anemias but are profound in degree. Ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis result in a striking hyperplasia of erythroid progenitors, with a shift towards early forms. The expanded erythropoietic marrow may completely fill the intramedullary space of the skeleton, invade the bony cortex, impair bone growth, and produce skeletal deformities. Extramedullary hematopoiesis and hyperplasia of mononuclear phagocytes result in prominent splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. The ineffective erythropoietic precursors consume nutrients and produce growth retardation and a degree of cachexia reminiscent of that seen in cancer patients. Unless steps are taken to prevent iron overload, during the span of years, severe hemosiderosis develops.

Laboratory studies show hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 34.8%, MCV of 73 mm3, platelet count of 315,000/ mm3, and WBC count of 8035/ mm3. Which of the following is the most sensitive and cost-effective test that the physician should order to help to determine the cause of these findings?",Bone marrow biopsy,Hemoglobin electrophoresis,Serum ferritin,Serum haptoglobin,"With RBC microcytosis, iron deficiency anemia must be considered. It could be a nutritional deficiency in children and pregnant women, but more likely is due to chronic blood loss in adults. The ferritin concentration is a measure of storage iron because it is derived from the total body storage pool in the liver, spleen, and marrow. About 80% of functional body iron is contained in hemoglobin; the remainder is in muscle myoglobin. Individuals with severe liver disease can have an elevated serum ferritin level because of its release from liver stores. A bone marrow biopsy specimen provides a good indication of iron stores because the iron stain of the marrow shows hemosiderin in macrophages, but such a biopsy is an expensive procedure. Some patients with hemoglobinopathies, such as b-thalassemia, also can have microcytic anemia, but this is far less common than iron deficiency. The serum haptoglobin level is decreased with intravascular hemolysis, but the anemia is normocytic because the iron can be recycled. The serum iron concentration or transferrin level by itself gives no indication of iron stores because, in anemia of chronic disease, the patient's iron level can be normal to low, and the transferrin levels also can be normal to low, but iron stores are increased. Transferrin, a serum transport protein for iron, usually has about 33% iron saturation.",C

GnRH analogue used in hormonal treatment of carcinoma prostate?,Goserelin,Nilutamide,Cyproterone acetate,Finasteride,"Ans. a (Goserelin) (Ref. KDT 6th/pg. 239)Many analogues of GnRH, e.g. Buserelin, Goserelin, Leuprolide, Nafarelin, Triptorelin, have been developed: are 15-150 times more potent than natural Gn RH and longer acting. The superactive GnRH agonists are used as nasal spray or injected s.c. Long-acting preparations for once a month s.c. injection have been produced (triptorelin depot). The resulting reversible pharmacological oophorectomy /orchiectomy is being used in precocious puberty, prostatic carcinoma, endometriosis, premenopausal breast cancer, uterine leiomyoma, PCOD and to assist induced ovulation. It also has potential to be used as contraceptive for both males and females.# Goserelin is a drug often used in prostate carcinoma. Goserelin can cause gynecomastia as a side effect.# Anastrozole is a selective nonsteroidal inhibitor of aromatase. It is presently approved for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer that is ER-positive.# Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of aromatase that is significantly more potent than aminoglutethimide and acts in the same way as anastrozole. It is also indicated for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.# Exemestane is a steroidal hormonal agent that binds to and irreversibly inactivates aromatase. It is indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed on tamoxifen therapy.1.BicalutamideNonsteroidal anti-androgens2.Finasteride5-alpha reductase inhibitor3.OxybutyninMuscarinic receptor antagonists4.GoserelinLHRH analogue5.SildenafilPDE5 inhibitor6.Cyproterone acetateSteroidal anti-androgens7.TamsulosinAlpha blocker# Prostate cancer is classically treated with diethylstilbesterol (DES) acting as an estrogen at the level of the hypothalamus to downregulate hypothalamic luteinizing hormone (LH) production, resulting in decreased elaboration of testosterone by the testicle. For this reason, orchiectomy is equally as effective as moderate-dose DES.# In the event that orchiectomy is not accepted by the patient, testicular androgen suppression can also be effected by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists such as leuprolide and goserelin. These agents cause tonic stimulation of the LHRH receptor, with the loss of its normal pulsatile activation resulting in its desensitization and decreased output of LH by the anterior pituitary. Therefore, as primary hormonal manipulation in prostate cancer one can choose orchiectomy or leuprolide, not both.# The addition of actual antagonists of androgens acting at the androgen receptor, including flutamide or bicalutamide, is of uncertain additional benefit in extending overall response duration, but it clearly prevents the activation of androgen receptors by adrenal androgens, and the combined use of orchiectomy or leuprolide plus flutamide is referred to as 'total androgen blockade.'",A

"A 13-year-old, previously healthy boy has had pain in the right leg for the past month. There is no history of trauma or recent illness. On physical examination, there is warmth and tenderness to palpation of the right lower thigh anteriorly, and the circumference of the right thigh is slightly larger than that of the left. His temperature is 39degC. A radiograph of the right leg shows a 6-cm expansile mass in the diaphyseal region of the right lower femur that extends into the soft tissue and is covered by layers of reactive bone. A biopsy of the mass is done, and microscopic examination shows sheets of closely packed primitive cells with small, uniform nuclei and only scant cytoplasm. Karyotypic analysis of the tumor cells shows a t(11;22) translocation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chondrosarcoma,Ewing sarcoma,Giant cell tumor,Metastatic carcinoma,"The histologic appearance is characteristic of an Ewing sarcoma. The radiologic appearance of the mass in this child is typical for a malignant tumor, with bone destruction and soft-tissue extension. The two most common malignant bone tumors in children are osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Osteosarcomas typically arise in the metaphyseal region, whereas Ewing sarcoma arises in the diaphyseal region of long tubular bones, as seen in this case. This tumor usually occurs in patients 10 to 15 years old. The t (11;22) translocation is present in about 85% of Ewing sarcomas and the related primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), which belong to the small round cell tumors of childhood that can be difficult to distinguish microscopically. The translocation gives rise to the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene, now considered the definitive test for the diagnosis of these tumors. Ewing sarcomas often produce tender masses with fever and leukocytosis, mimicking acute osteomyelitis. Chondrosarcoma can occur across a wide age range, in contrast to most primary malignancies arising in bone, which occur most often in the first two decades; most are sufficiently differentiated so that a cartilaginous matrix is apparent on microscopic examination. A giant cell tumor is a benign but locally aggressive lesion that arises in the epiphysis of the long bones of young adults and has a 'soap bubble' radiographic appearance. Metastatic carcinoma is the most common tumor of adults involving bone because there are far more carcinomas than primary bone malignancies; childhood bone metastases are rare. Osteosarcoma typically arises in the metaphyseal region, and the malignant spindle cells produce an osteoid matrix. A plasmacytoma produces a focal lytic lesion within the bone, and microscopically there are recognizable plasma cells.",B
Which one of the following is not used as a tumor marker in testicular tumours ?,AFP,LDH,HCG,CEA,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) describes a set of highly related glycoproteins involved in cell adhesion. CEA is normally produced in gastrointestinal tissue during fetal development, but the production stops before bih. Therefore, CEA is usually present only at very low levels in the blood of healthy adults. However, the serum levels are raised in some types of cancer, which means that it can be used as a tumor marker in clinical tests. Serum levels can also be elevated in heavy smokers. CEA are glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) cell-surface-anchored glycoproteins whose specialized sialofucosylated glycoforms serve as functional colon carcinoma L-selectin and E-selectin ligands, which may be critical to the metastatic dissemination of colon carcinoma cells. Immunologically they are characterized as members of the CD66 cluster of differentiation. The proteins include CD66a, CD66b, CD66c, CD66d, CD66e",D

Displacement of a protein bound drug-,T Drug plasma level,T Side effects,Free level,Effect,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., T Drug plasma level One drug can bind to many sites on the albumin molecules. o Conversely, more than one drug can bind to the same site. o This can give rise to displacement interactions among drugs bound to the same sites. o Drug bound with higher affinity will displace that bound with lower affinity. The concentration of free form (plasma level) will increase. o However this is often transient because the displaced drug will diffuse into the tissues as well as get metabolized or excreted. o The new steady state free drug concentration is only marginally higher unless the displacement extends to tissue binding or there is concurrent inhibition of metabolism and excretion. The overall impact of many displacement interactions is minimal, clinical significance being attained only in case of highly bound drugs with limited volume of distribution and where interaction is more complex.",A

internalization of material and subsequent lysosomal digestion:,Pinocytosis,Phagocytosis,Receptor mediated endocytosis,Exocytosis,"Active transport
Movement across a membrane from an area of low concentration to high concentration.
Since carriers are involved, it demonstrates MichaelisMenten kinetics.
It is a unidirectional transport that requires energy (ATP).
a. Endocytosis—vacuole formation utilizing plasma membrane and released inside the cell.
May result in degradation.
If vacuole is fused with lysozymes, results in degradation.
(1) Pinocytosis—
internalization of interstitial fluid.
(2) Phagocytosis—
internalization of material and subsequent lysosomal digestion.
(3) Receptor mediated endocytosis—
selective internalization of receptor/ligand complex. Receptor complex may return to surface.
b. Exocytosis—secretory vesicle membrane from within the cell fuses with the plasma membrane, and the contents of the vesicle are released outside the cell.
c. Primary active transport—energy derived from ATP.
Specific carriers are utilized, which are saturable.
(1) Ca2+-ATPase pumps are important active transports in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes.
(2) Na+K+-ATPase pump is present in all plasma membranes.
- Establishes and maintains a Na+ and K+ gradient by transporting Na+ out and K+ into the cell.
- The Na+ concentration gradient is the force for secondary active transport mechanisms.
d. Secondary active transport—ATP establishes an ionic gradient, which is the driving force (secondary transport).
(1) Na+ gradient established by membrane pumps drive this system.
(2) Protein carriers bind both the substance transported and Na+.
(3) Cotransport systems—Na+ and substance transported move in the same direction.
Examples include:
- Glucose and galactose across GI mucosa and resorption in renal tubule.
- Amino acid transport in GI mucosa and renal tubules.
(4) Countertransport—
- Na+ and transported substance move in opposite directions.
Examples include:
- Na+/H+ exchange (H+ out and Na+ into cells).
- Na+/Ca2+ exchange (Ca2+ out and Na+ into cells)",B

Whether the PAS positivity of a particular cell is due to presence of glycogen or due to latter can be differentiated with diastase (glycogen digesting enzyme).
If the cell is PAS positive due to glycogen, the pretreatment with diastase will make it PAS negative. But if the cell is PAS positive due to non glycogen substances, the cell will retain its PAS positivity even after pretreatment with diastase. So, in the given question, the presence of PAS positive and diastase resistant material indicates presence of non glycogen substances.
The clinical feature of delayed milestones and hepatosplenomegaly in 1 year old boy is suggestive of some lysosomal storage disorder (like Niemann Picks disease).

About p53 all are true except,Encodes 53k Da protein,Located on Chr. 17,Arrests cell cycle at GI phase,Wild type p53 is associated with childhood tumors.,"Wild type p53 is associated with childhood tumours Wild type 53 is the normal (non mutated form of p53). The normal p53 gene is a tumour suppressor gene that prevents the development of tumours. When wild/normal p53 gene undergoes some mutation, it is called the mutant p53 gene. Mutant p53 gene is associated with various human cancers. - A little over 50% human tumours contain mutation in this gene. - Homozygous loss of p53 occurs in viually every type of cancer including carcinomas of the lung, colon and breast. p53 Guardian of genome p53 gene is located on chromosome 17Q. It is a tumour suppressor gene. 'p53 acts as a molecular policemean that prevents the propagation of genetically damaged cell'. - p53 gene product i.e., p53 protein is a DNA binding protein in the nucleus, when called into action, it controls the transcription of several other genes. The major functional activities of the p53 protein are: ? Activation of temporary cell cycle arrest (quiescence) -p53 induces transcription of p21deg, a CDK inhibitor. - p21 inhibit cyclin D-CDK-4 e complex leading to arrest of cell cycle late in G1 phase. - This allows time for DNA repair (1. DNA repair p53 helps in DNA repair not only by allowing time for DNA repair but also by directly inducing the transcription of GADD 45Q (growth arrest and DNA damage). - GADD 45 encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair. - If DNA damage is repaired successfully, p53 activates MDM 2 which in turn causes degradation of p53. This MDM-2 induced degradation of p53 causes relieve in cell cycle block. Triggering of programmed cell death p53 directs the transcription of several pro-apoptotic genes such as BAX and PUMA (approved name BBC3) and induces apoptosis. Induction of pennanent cell cycle arrest (quiescent) p53 can also cause permanent cell cycle arrest. It is characterized by specific changes in morphology and the exact mechanism is not known.",D

Incidence in these areas of endemic disease is 100 per million children.* Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is found in nearly all areas. In endemic areas, there seems to be a correlation with the geographic distribution of endemic malaria.* Malaria infection also probably plays a role in the pathogenesis of BL, as it can lead to inhibition of EBV- specific immune response. The exact mechanism of EBV-mediated lymphomagenesis, however, is not well understood, but evidence exists for a significant interaction between viral and cellular microRNA (miRNA) interfering with normal gene expression and translation. EBV can be detected in 25-40% of immunodeficiency-associated cases.",B

Some investigators have suggested that FSGS and minimal-change disease are pa of a continuum and that minimal-change disease may transform into FSGS. Others believe them to be distinct clinicopathologic entities from the outset. In any case, injury to the podocytes is thought to represent the initiating event of primary FSGS. As with minimal change disease, permeability-increasing factors produced by lymphocytes have been proposed. The deposition of hyaline masses in the glomeruli represents the entrapment of plasma proteins and lipids in foci of injury where sclerosis develops.IgM and complement proteins commonly seen in the lesion are also believed to result from nonspecific entrapment in damaged glomeruli.

Which of the following should be monitored if linezolid is given for more than 14 days?,Liver function tests,Kidney function test,Platelet count,Audiometry,"Because of the increase in multi-drug-resistant strains of gram-positive bacteria, the development of new and novel-acting antimicrobial agents is at the forefront of pharmaceutical research. Currently, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is a major clinical problem. Linezolid (Zyvox(r)-Pfizer) is an antimicrobial agent of the oxazolidinone class that possesses a wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms, including MRSA and VRE. Because of linezolid's novel mechanism of action, cross-resistance with other antimicrobial agents is not expected. Linezolid is therefore a ble option for ceain types of infectious disease. Linezolid should not be used for empiric therapy, except under unusual circumstances, or to treat mild gram-positive infections where other antimicrobial agents would be effective. Thrombocytopenia has been repoed in patients treated with linezolid. Platelet levels in most patients returned to normal during the follow-up period. The risk of thrombocytopenia appears to be related to duration of therapy. Platelet counts should be monitored at baseline and at least every 7 days during treatment.",C

True about protooncogene-,Impoant for normal cell growth,Oncogenesis,C-myc overexpression causes lymphoma,Mutation causes Retinoblastoma,"A proto-oncogene is a normal gene that could become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals, usually through their protein products. Upon acquiring an activating mutation, a proto-oncogene becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene. Examples of proto-oncogenes include RAS, WNT, MYC, ERK, and TRK. The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt's Lymphoma, which stas when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence within the vicinity of the MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors. When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr-Abl gene found on the Philadelphia Chromosome, a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22.

Dopamine is preferred in treatment of shock because -,Renal vasodilatory effect,Increased cardiac output,Peripheral vasoconstriction,Prolonged action,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Renal vasodilatory effect Dopamine in shock o In shock, the main problem is inadequate tissue perfusion, especially to the vital organs. This includes decreased renal perfusion, leading to decrease in urine output. o When the patient is being treated, main aim is to improve perfusion; not just to raise blood pressure. o Dopamine dilates the renal blood vessels and improves renal perfusion, therefore it is preferred in the shock. o However you should keep in mind that dopamine is preferred in shock due to this advantageous effect, i.e., renal venodilatory effect. But the primary mechanism of action which is responsible for the improvement in shock is positive chronotropic effect. o The primary defect is decreased cardiac output with inadequate tissue perfusion. o Therefore the primary mechanism of action of the drugs used in shock is to increase cardiac output by increasing the cardiac force of contraction (i.e., inotropic effect). o Dopamine has additional benefit, i.e., it dilates renal vessels. Therefore dopamine is preferred in shock. o From above discussion, you can understand that two question can be framed. (i) Primary mechanism of action of dopamine in shock --) Ionotropic effect (Cardiac stimulation/increased cardiac output). (ii) Dopamine is preferred in shock --) Because it has renal venodilatory effect. o Following statement will clear your doubt. 'An advantage of using dopamine in the treatment of shock is that its inotropic action increases cardiac output while dilating renal blood vessels and thereby increasing renal blood flow' Modern pharmacology with clinical application. 'Dopamine is used in cardiogenic shock. Dopamine is an effective inotropic agent that causes less increase in hea rate (less chronotropic effect)'.

The most common side effects are muscle tremor and palpitations, which are seen more commonly in elderly patients.o There is a small fall in plasma potassium due to increased uptake by skeletal muscle cells, but this effect does not usually cause any clinical problem.Adverse effects of inhalational b2 - agonistso Owing to their b-selectivity and topical delivery (inhalation), adverse effects are not usually a problem with b2 agonists.o At higher doses systemic absorption and side effects occur due to activation of b-adrenergic receptorsThe most common side effects are muscle tremor and palpitationHypokalemia - biochemical pump that shifts potassium into cells is activated by the b2-receptor agonists, i.e. there is increased intracellular uptake of potassium especially in skeletal muscles.Hyperglycemia - Due to b2 mediated gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.Toleranceo Tolerance is a potential problem with b2-agonists.o It is due to down regulation of b2-receptors caused by continous exposure of tissues to b-agonists.o This may cause tachyphylaxis (rapidly developing tolerance). (Note - other drugs showing tachyphylaxis are indirectly acting sympathomimetics, e.g. ephedrine, amphetamine, tyramine).o So, b2 agonists should not be used on any regular schedule - due to tolerance, bronchial hyperactivity not reduced on continous use.o It is advised that patients requiring regular medication should be treated with inhaled steroids and use of b2 agonist inhalers should be restricted to symptomatic relief of on acute attack.Throat irritationAnkle edema7..

"A 27 year old man with AIDS develops a reddish, slightly raised rash on his face, neck, and mouth, consistent in appearance with Kaposi's sarcoma. Microscopically, the proliferating cells in this malignancy most closely resemble which of the following?",Angiosarcoma,Carcinosarcoma,Lymphoma,Malignant fibrous histiocytoma,"Kaposi's sarcoma is a spindle cell neoplasm that is highly associated with AIDS and with the Herpes simplex virus type 8. The tumor has an appearance very similar to that of angiosarcoma-proliferating stromal cells and endothelium creating vascular channels that contain blood cells. Carcinosarcoma is a tumor that contains malignant epithelial cells and malignant stromal cells. There is no epithelial element in Kaposi's sarcoma. Although lymphoma occurs with increased frequency in AIDS, it does not resemble Kaposi's sarcoma. Lymphoma involves neoplastic lymphocytes, whereas Kaposi's sarcoma involves neoplastic vascular structures. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is an extremely poorly differentiated (anaplastic) stromal malignancy. MFH does not produce any recognizable mesenchymal structures- thus, the production of vascular structures by Kaposi's sarcoma differentiates the two tumors.

This boy's condition most likely results from an abnormality involving",Chromosome 5,Chromosome 14,X Chromosome,Y Chromosome,"Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder that results from a deficiency of coagulation factor VIII. Since it is an X-linked disorder, the gene that codes for coagulation factor VIII must be on the X chromosome. Clinically, patients with hemophilia exhibit a wide range of severity of symptoms that depends upon the degree to which factor VII activity is decreased. Petechiae and small ecchymoses are characteristically absent, but large ecchymoses and subcutaneous and intramuscular hematomas are common. Other types of bleeding that are characteristic include massive hemorrhage following trauma or surgery and 'spontaneous' hemorrhages in pas of the body that are normally subject to trauma, such as the joints (hemahroses). Intra-abdominal hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage also occur. The latter is a major cause of death for these individuals. Because of the decreased factor VIII activity, patients with hemophilia A have a prolonged PTT, which measures the intrinsic coagulation cascade. Other clinical tests, including bleeding time, tourniquet test, platelet count, and PT, are normal.

"A woman who is allergic to cats visits a neighbor who has several cats. During the visit, she inhales cat dander, and within minutes, she develops nasal congestion with abundant nasal secretions. Which of the following substances is most likely to produce these findings?",Bradykinin,Complement C5a,Histamine,Interleukin-1 (IL-1),"Histamine is found in abundance in mast cells, which are normally present in connective tissues next to blood vessels beneath mucosal surfaces in airways. Binding of an antigen (allergen) to IgE antibodies that have previously attached to the mast cells by the Fc receptor triggers mast cell degranulation, with release of histamine. This response causes increased vascular permeability and mucous secretions. Bradykinin, generated from the kinin system on surface contact of Hageman factor with collagen and basement membrane from vascular injury, promotes vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and pain. Complement C5a is a potent chemotactic factor for neutrophils.

A clinical pharmacologist is gathering pharmacokinetic data during clinical trials of a new antimicrobial agent. He has already determined that the half-life of this drug is 4 hours. He began a continuous intravenous drip 24 hours ago at a rate of 10 mg/min. Blood tests after 24 hours reveal that the patient's drug plasma concentration is 20 mg/L. What is the clearance of this agent?,0.5 L/min,2 L/min,10 L/min,50 L/min,"You must be familiar with the maintenance dose equation, to answer this question: M.D. = Cl x Cpss/F, where M.D. = maintenance dose Cl = clearance Cpss = plasma concentration at steady state F = bioavailability In this case, M.D. is 10 mg/min; F, or how much drug is absorbed, is 1 (100%) because drugs administered I.V. are completely absorbed. (F becomes impoant when drugs are given orally.) Cpss = 20 mg/L; it takes 4 -5 half-lives to achieve steady state, so this drug has been administered for a time period equaling 6 half-lives. Solving, 10 mg/mL = Cl x 20 mg/mL Cl = 0.5 L/min",A
Supraventicular tachycardia can be managed best by: September 2009,Digitalis,Adenosine,Disopyramide,Quinidine,"Ans. B: Adenosine Although adenosine is a powerful vasodilator, especially in the coronary circulation, it is not used clinically as a vasodilator. The reason is that it is very sho acting and in the hea it can produce coronary vascular steal. When administered by intravenous infusion, it can produce substantial hypotension. Adenosine is used, however, as an antiarrhythmic drug for the rapid treatment of supraventricular tachycardias. Its effects on atrioventricular conduction make it very useful in treating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in which the AV node is pa of the reentry pathway (as in Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome. Adenosine is administered either as bolus intravenous injection or as an intravenous infusion.",B
"A 36-year-old man who had been healthy all his life now has progressive, symmetric muscular weakness. A year ago, he noted weakness in the area of the head and neck, which caused difficulty with speech, eye movements, and swallowing. In the past year, the weakness in the upper and lower extremities has increased, and he can no longer stand, walk, or feed himself. His mental function remains intact. Which of the following cells is most likely being destroyed in this man?",Ependymal cell,Lower motor neuron,Microglial cell,Oligodendrocyte,"The progressive and symmetric nature of this patient's disease is a classic feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The muscles show a denervation type of grouped atrophy from the loss of lower motor neurons in anterior horns of the spinal cord. The 'bulbar' form of ALS affects mainly cranial nerve nuclei and has a more aggressive course. Cortical upper motor neurons may also be lost, but the mental function is preserved in ALS. Ependymal cells line ventricles, which are normal in ALS. Microglial cells have a macrophage-like function and may be involved in demyelinating plaques of multiple sclerosis that can produce various motor signs and symptoms over time, but symmetry is not a feature of this disease. Oligodendrocytes provide myelin to axons in the CNS. Parkinson's disease with loss of substantia nigra pigmented neurons is characterized by rigidity and involuntary movements, not by muscular weakness. Huntington disease with loss of spiny neurons in the caudate nucleus causes abnormal movements, not weakness, and there can be associated dementia over time.",B

Metaplasia may be of two types1. Epithelial metaplasia* Here one type of adult epithelium is replaced by another type of adult epithelium. It may be :-a) Squamous metaplasia# It occurs most frequently in respiratory tract as a result of chronic irritation by cigarette smoking. The columnar epithelium is replaced by squamous epithelium. This squamous metaplasia represents an attempt by the host to repair or prepare an epithelial tissue that has been damaged by environmental toxicants with a more resistant tissue.# Squamous metaplasia is also encountered in other location such as pancreatic duct (Vit A deficiency, stones in pancreatic duct), gall bladder (gall stones), urinary bladder (bladder calculi, Schistosomiasis), and in endocervix.# Though the metaplasia is reversible, if the influences that predispose to metaplasia is persistent, malignant transformation may occur in metaplastic epithelium.b) Glandular metaplasia# It is a change of the squamous epithelium to glandular (columnar) epithelium e.g. development of Barrett's esophagus, i.e., Stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by gastric columnar epithelium. It is due to reflux of acid contents of stomach into esophagus. This necessitates the replacement of susceptible squamous epithelium of the lower third of esophagus with gastric acid resistant glandular epithelium.2. Connective tissue metaplasia* This transformation occurs between the mesodermally derived tissues i.e., one type of connective tissue is replaced by another type of connective tissue.

It is bactericidal to gram-positive cocci, Neisseria, Clostridia and diphtheroids. However, in hospitals where it has been extensively used for surgical prophylaxis, etc., vancomycin-resistant Staph. aureus (VRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) have emerged. These nosocomial bacteria are resistant to methicillin and most other antibiotics as well. Vancomycin acts by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It binds to the terminal dipeptide 'D-ala-D-ala' sequence of peptidoglycan unitsprevents its release from the bactoprenol lipid carrier so that assembly of the units at the cell membrane and their cross linking to form the cell wall cannot take place Enterococcal resistance to vancomycin is due to a plasmid mediated alteration of the dipeptide target site, reducing its affinity for vancomycin. Systemic use (500 mg 6 hourly or 1 g 12 hourly infused i.v. over 1 hr) is restricted to serious MRSA infections for which it is the most effective drug. and as a penicillin substitute (in allergic patients 1 for enterococcal endocarditis along with gentamicin.

Free water clearance decreased by ?,Vincristine,Vinblastine,Chlorpropamide,Furosemide,"Furosemide Free water clearance Kidney excretes some solutes in the urine daily. The volume of water in urine, excreted per unit time in excess of that required to excrete the contained solutes isoosmatically with plasma is called free water clearance. Free water clearance is positive dilute urine, negative when concentrated urine is passed and zero when isotonic urine is passed. For example, if 1 lit water is required to excrete the contained solutes per day following three conditions may occur (numerical value are just for example). - If urine output is 1.5 litre than free water clearance will be + (positive) *5 lit/day. - If urine output is 1 litre per day, the free water clearance will be zero. - If urine output is *5 litre per day, the free water clearance will be -- (negative) .5lit/day. Action of diuretics To understand the effect of different diuretics on free water clearance one should know the following facts. The nephron of the kidney is arranged in such a way that some poion of it lies in the coex and some poion of it lies in the medulla. - Pas of nephron in the coex - Proximal convoluted tubule Distal convoluted tubule Thick ascending limb of Henle's loop Coical collecting duct - Pas of nephron in the medulla -9 *Descending thin limb of Henle's loop Ascending thin limb of Henle's loop Medullary collecting duct The coical poion of the nephron are responsible for diluting the urine (i.e., positive free water clearance) The medullary poions of the nephron are responsible for concentrating the urine (i.e.. negative free water clearance) Thus the diuretics which act on both medulla and coex can affect both the positive and negative free water clearance where as diuretics which act on either coex or medulla cannot affect both the negative and positive free water clearance. Furosentide Furosemide is a drug which act on both coex and medulla. It acts on the ascending limb of loop of henle which has both coical and medullary component i.e. the thin ascending pa is situated in the coex and the thicker poion is situated in the medulla. Furosemide acts in the following ways: - In hypovolemia medullary pa of ascending limb concentrate the --) negative free water clearance urine to preserve water --> block negative free water clearance - Furosemide blocks the concentrating ability of the ascending limb pa of medullary pa - In volume overload, coical poion of ascending limb of henle --) positive free water clearance loop dilute the urine to decrease the volume overload - Furosemide blocks this diluting ability as well block positive free water clearance. Thus Furosemide can block positive as well as negative free water clearance. Thiazide diuretics act on DCT and proximal pa of CD, block positive free water clearance but has no effect on negative free water clearance. In hypervolumia DCT dilute the urine to decrease the volume overload -4 positive free water clearance --> blocked by thiazide. As thiazide diuretics no effect on medullary interstitium (in contrast to furosamide) so it does not effect the kidney's ability to concentrate urine during hypovolemia --4 no effect on negative free water. Two more options given in the question block free water clearance Vincristine Vincristine increases the secretion of the hormone A.D.H. Inreased A.D.H blocks free water clearance. Chlorpropamide Chlorpropamide sensitizes the kidney to ADH action. Thus it may impair the free water clearance and in some patients may result in hyponatremia and water intoxication. The impoant point to remember about chlorpropamide is that its action depends on small amount of ADH it won't act in the absence of ADH. Most probably the question should have been framed as 'All of the following blocks free water clearance, except' But if you have to choose one answer, go for Furosemide as it will always block free water clearance whereas other drugs will cause them occasionally as their adverse effect.",D

AA amyloid chain is found in-,Multiple myeloma,Rheumatoid ahritis,Gout,None.,"The AA (amyloid-associated) fibril is a unique nonimmunoglobulin protein derived from a larger (12-kDa)serum precursor called SAA (serum amyloid-associated) protein that is synthesized in the liver. SAA is synthesized by liver cells under the influence of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 that are produced during inflammation; thus, long-standing inflammation leads to elevated SAA levels, and ultimately the AA form of amyloid deposits. However, increased production of SAA by itself is not sufficient for the deposition of amyloid. Elevation of serum SAA levels is common to inflammatory states but in most instances does not lead to amyloidosis. There are two possible explanations for this. According to one view, SAA normally is degraded to soluble end products by the action of monocyte-derived enzymes. Conceivably, people who develop amyloidosis have an enzyme defect that results in incomplete breakdown of SAA, thus generating insoluble AA molecules. Alternatively, a genetically determined structural abnormality in the SAA molecule itself renders it resistant to degradation by macrophages . Robbins 9 th edition page no. 153",D

A renal pathologist examining the day's kidney biopsies notes that one biopsy shows amorphous red nodules within the glomerular mesangium in hematoxylin and eosin stained material. Congo red stain of the biopsy demonstrates apple-green birefringence of these nodules. These nodules are most likely to be related to which of the following?,Acute urinary tract infection,Diabetes mellitus,Sarcoidosis,Tuberculosis,"Glomerular nodules may be either the Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules of diabetes mellitus or may be composed of amyloid. An amyloid origin can be confirmed by staining with Congo red, which causes the nodules to stain red with ordinary light but exhibit a distinctive 'apple-green' birefringence when viewed with polarized light. The most common type of amyloid (type AA) is due to deposition of altered immunoglobulin light chains and is seen in diseases with chronic antigenic stimulation, such as tuberculosis. Acute urinary tract infection is an infection of too sho a duration to cause amyloidosis. Diabetes mellitus is associated with glomerular nodules called Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules, but these will not show apple-green birefringence when viewed with polarized light. Sarcoidosis typically involves the lymph nodes, lungs, spleen, and to a lesser extent, the skin and eye. It is unrelated to amyloidosis.

Effect of dopamine on kidney is blocked by-,Pindolol,Phentolamine,Propranolol,Haloperidol,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Haloperidol Antagonism of dopamine actions o As the receptors stimulated by dopamine are different at different rates of infusion, the antagonists are different for different rates of infusion. Antagonism of renal dose o Low rates of dopamine infusion cause stimulation of dopamine receptors and produce vasodilatation of renal and mesentric blood vessels. o This vasodilatation of dopamine is not antagonised by the J3-adrenoreceptor blockers (as this renal effect is not mediated by [3-receptors). o However this vasodilatation of renal vessels is antagonized by halopridol and other dopamine receptor blocking agents. Antagonism of intermediate dose o The infusion of moderately higher concentrations of dopamine increases the rate and contractile force of the hea and augments the cardiac output. o This action is mediated by piadrenoreceptor and due to nor-adrenaline release, and is antagonized by propranolol. Antagonism of higher doses o At still higher concentrations, dopamine causes a-adrenoreceptor - mediated vasoconstriction in most vascular beds and stimulates the hea. o The vasoconstrictive action of dopamine is antagonized by a-adrenoreceptor blocking agents such as phentolamine.",D

Which is used in overactive bladderaEUR',Duloxetine,Darfinacin,Flavoxate,Oxybutynin,"Darfinacin; 'C' i.e., Flavoxate; `d' i.e., Oxybutynin Detrusor instability (Overactive bladder) Detrusor is a smooth muscle which forms the body of the bladder. Its contraction causes micturition. The other smooth muscle that plays an impoant role in micturition is the internal sphincter. Internal sphincter is a concentraction of smooth muscle at the bladder neck. It is well developed only in males and its principal. function is to prevent retrograde .flow of semen during ejaculation. When detrusor relaxes and the sphincters close urine is stored. Whereas voiding requires contraction of destrusor accompanied by relaxation of sphincters. Detrusor is innervated mainly by parasympathetic nerves which are excitatory and cause the muscle to contract where as internal sphincter is rich in aI adrenoreceptor (sympathetic nerves). Thus the mechanisms of urine voiding involves:? - Increased parasympathetic drive Contracts the detrusor - Decreased sympathetic drive Relax the sphincter Detrusor instability or unstable bladder is characterized by uninhibited, unstable contractions of the detrusor which may be of unknown etiology or secondary to an upper motor neuron lesion or bladder neck obstruction. Since detrusor contracts under parasympathetic influence, Anticholinergic (specifically antimuscarinic) drugs are used to treat overactive bladder disease or detrusor instability. These agents lower intravesical pressure, increase capacity and reduce the frequency of contractions by antagonizing para.sympa- thetic control of bladder. These agents include: ? - Darifenacin - Solefenacin - Tolterodine - Trospium chloride - Oxybutynin - Solifenacin - Flavoxate Duloxetine is used in stress incontinence. It is a dual norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Its mechanism of action is thought to be centrally, by increasing urethral sphincter tone and contractility.

All of the following are true regarding Wegener's granulomatosis except: September 2008,Affects large size blood vessels,May affect lungs and kidneys,Necrotizing granuloma may be seen on microscopy,PR3-ANCAs are present in upto 95% of cases,"Ans. A: Affects large size blood vesselsWegener's granulomatosis is a form of vasculitis that affects the lungs, kidneys and other organs.Due to its end-organ damage, it is life-threatening and requires long-term immunosuppression.Wegener's granulomatosis is pa of a larger group of vasculitic syndromes, all of which feature an autoimmune attack by an abnormal type of circulating antibody termed ANCAs (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) against small and medium-size blood vessels.Apa from Wegener's, this category includes Churg-Strauss syndrome and microscopic polyangiitis.Cytoplasmic staining ANCAs that react with the enzyme proteinase 3 (cANCA) in neutrophils are associated with Wegener's (upto 95% of cases).If the patient has renal failure or cutaneous vasculitis, these are the most logical organs to obtain a biopsy from.On histopathological examination, a biopsy will show leukocytoclastic vasculitis with necrotic changes and granulomatous inflammation on microscopy. These granulomas are the main reason for the appellation of 'Wegener's granulomatosis', although it is not an essential feature.",A

"A 40-year-old man experiences weakness and easy fatigability of 2 months' duration. Physical examination yields no remarkable findings. Laboratory studies show a serum calcium of 11.5 mg/dL, inorganic phosphorus of 2.1 mg/dL, and serum parathyroid hormone of 58 pg/mL, which is near the top of the reference range. A radionuclide bone scan fails to show any areas of increased uptake. What is the most likely cause of these findings?",Chronic renal failure,Hypervitaminosis D,Medullary thyroid carcinoma,Parathyroid adenoma,"When a patient develops hypercalcemia, a disorder of the parathyroid glands or malignancy at a visceral location must be considered. The elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) suggests primary hyperparathyroidism. The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a parathyroid adenoma. Secondary hyperparathyroidism, most commonly resulting from renal failure, is excluded when the serum inorganic phosphate level is low because phosphate is retained with chronic renal failure. Hypervitaminosis D can cause hypercalcemia because of increased calcium absorption, but in these cases, the PTH levels are expected to be near the low end of the reference range because of feedback suppression. Serum PTH levels near the high end of the reference range indicate autonomous PTH secretion unregulated by hypercalcemia. Although medullary carcinomas of the thyroid often have positive immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin, and plasma levels are sometimes increased, there is typically no major reduction in serum calcium as a result.",D

"In acute inflammation due to the contraction of endothelial cell cytoskeleton, which of the following results",Delayed transient increase in permeability,Delayed permanent increase,Early permanent increase,Early transient increase,"Since the two major mechanisms of host defence against microbes i.e. antibodies and leucocytes are normally carried in the bloodstream, it is not surprising that vascular phenomenon plays a major role in acute inflammation 
Normally, plasma proteins and circulating cells are sequestered inside the vessels and move in the direction of flow.
In inflammation, blood vessels undergo a series of changes that are designed to maximize the movement of plasma proteins and circulating cells out of the circulation and into the site of injury or infection.

Changes in vessel
The changes occur in the following order
(i) Vasodilatation - the Earliest manifestation of acute inflammation sometimes it follows a transient constriction of arterioles.
ii. Vasodilation is quickly followed by increased permeability of the microvasculature.
iii. Stasis - Increased vascular permeability • The hallmark of acute inflammation is increased vascular permeability Acute inflammation has three major steps: -",D

Neointimal hyperplasia causes vascular graft failure as a result of hyperophy of,Endothelial cells,Collagen fibers,Smooth muscle cells,Elastic fibers,"Vascular injury leading to endothelial cell loss or dysfunction stimulates smooth muscle cell growth and associated matrix synthesis. Healing of injured vessels involves the migration of smooth muscle cells or smooth muscle cell precursor cells into the intima. Here these cells proliferate, and synthesize ECM in much the same way that fibroblasts fill in a wound, forming a neointima that typically is covered by an intact endothelial cell layer. This neointimal response occurs with any form of vascular damage or dysfunction, including infection, inflammation, immune injury, physical trauma (e.g., from a balloon catheter or hypeension), or toxic exposure (e.g. oxidized lipids or cigarette smoke). Thus, intimal thickening is a stereotypical response of the vessel wall to any insult ( Robbins Basic Pathology, 9 th edition, page 334 )",C

Treatment of Mycobacteria avium complex include all except:,Ciprofloxacin,Clarithromycin,Rifabutin,Pyrazinamide,"Ciprofloxacin (prototype): It is the most potent first generation FQ acti\*e against a broad range of bacteria, the most susceptible ones are the aerobic gram-negati\*e bacilli, especially the Enterobacteriaceae and Neisseria. The MIC of ciprofloxacin against these bacteria is usually < 0.microgram/ml, while grampositive bacteria are inhibited at relatively higher concentrations. The spectrum of action E summarized below: Highly susceptible E. coli K. pneumoniae Enterobacter Salmonella typhi other Salmonella Shigella Proteus Neisseria gonorrhoeae N. meningitidis H. influenzae H. ducreyi Campylobacter jejuni Yersinia enterocolitica Vibrio cholerae Clarithromycin: The antimicrobial spectrum of clarithromycin is similar to erythromycin; in addition, it includes Mycobact. avium complex (MAC), other atypical mycobacteria, Mycobact. leprae and some anaerobes but not Bact.fragilis. It is more active against sensitive strains of gram-positive cocci, Moraxella, Legionella, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori. However, bacteria that have developed resistance to erythromycin are resistant to clarithomycin also. Rifabutin:It is related to rifampin in structure and mechanism of action; but less active against M. tuberculi and more active against MAC. Only paial cross resistance occurs between the two. In a dose of 300 mg/ day rifabutin is used for prophylaxis of MAC infection in AIDS patient. For the treatment of established MAC infection, it has been added to ethambutol + clarithromycin/ azithromycin. Pyrazinamide (Z): Chemically similar to INH, pyrazinamide (Z) was developed parallel to it in 1952. It is weakly tuberculocidal but more active in acidic medium. It is more lethal to intracellularly located bacilli and to those at sites showing an inflammatory response (pH is acidic at both these locations). It is highly effective during the first 2 months of therapy when inflammatory changes are present. By killing the residual intracellular bacilli it has good &;sterilizing&; activity.

Which of the following pulmonary condition is associated with widespread formation of hyaline membranes in the alveolar cavities?,Asthma,Bacterial pneumonia,Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis,Diffuse alveolar damage,"Diffuse alveolar damage, clinically referred to as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is characterized by diffuse damage to the alveolar/capillary barrier, which may result from diverse acute conditions. The four most frequent causes are trauma, sepsis, shock, and gastric aspiration. The pathogenesis is not entirely clear, but influx of neutrophils and release of cytokines, eicosanoids, and free radicals seem to be crucial in promoting alveolar damage. The most characteristic histopathologic hallmark of diffuse alveolar damage is formation of hyaline membranes within the alveolar cavities. These consist of proteinaceous material of plasma origin and necrotic debris from desquamated epithelium. The condition has a 60% moality and manifests with acute respiratory failure.Also Know:The pathologic features of asthma are relatively nonspecific and are similar, for example, to those of chronic bronchitis, including chronic inflammatory infiltration, hyperplasia of mucous glands, and hyperophy of smooth muscle. The presence of numerous eosinophils, however, is more characteristic of asthma. Bacterial pneumonia is characterized by intra-alveolar exudation of neutrophils, fibrin, and erythrocytes. Bacteria are also present within the alveolar cavities. Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) is a form of interstitial disease referred to as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

All are affected in Graft-Versus host reaction ?,Skin,GLT,Liver,Lung,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. Lung Graft versus host disease o Graft versus host disease occurs in any situation in which immunologically competent cells or their precursors are transplanted into immunologically crippled patients and the transferred cells recognize alloantigens in the host. o Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogenic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e.g. the liver) or transfusion of unirradiated blood. o Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation. o When such recipients receive normal bone marrow cells from allogenic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognizes the recipient's HLA antigen as foreign antigen and react against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues. o In clinical practice GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HIA matched donor and recipient. o Acute GVH disease occurs within days to weeks after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. o Although any organ may be affected, the major clinical manifestation results from involvement of the immune system and epithelia of the skin, liver and intestines. o Involvement of the skin in GVH disease is manifested by a generalized rash leading to desquamation in severe cases. o Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice and mucosal ulceration of the gut results in bloody diarrhoea. o Immunodeficiency is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease. The immunodeficiency may be a result of prior treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipient's immune system and attack on host's immune cells by grafted lymphocytes. o Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections. Although many different types of organisms may infect patients, infection with cytomegalovirus is paicularly impoant.",D

Mediastinal lymph node calcification is seen in which one of the following-,Metastatic neoplasm,Lymphoma,Sarcoidosis,Bronchiectasis,"Ref:Robbins Basic Pathology (9th Edition),page no.478,479 Sarcoidosis Although sarcoidosis is considered here as an example of a restrictive lung disease, it is impoant to note that sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by noncaseating granulomas in many tissues and organs. MORPHOLOGY The diagnostic histopathologic feature of sarcoidosis is the noncaseating epithelioid granuloma, irrespective of the organ involved. This is a discrete, compact collection of epithelioid cells rimmed by an outer zone of largely CD4+ T cells. The epithelioid cells are derived from macrophages and are characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei. It is not uncommon to see intermixed multinucleate giant cells formed by fusion of macrophages. A thin layer of laminated fibroblasts is present peripheral to the granuloma; over time, these proliferate and lay down collagen that replaces the entire granuloma with a hyalinized scar. Two other microscopic features are sometimes seen in the granulomas: (1) Schaumann bodies, laminated concretions composed of calcium and proteins; and (2) asteroid bodies, stellate inclusions enclosed within giant cells. Their presence is not required for diagnosis of sarcoidosis--they also may occur in granulomas of other origins. Rarely, foci of central necrosis may be present in sarcoid granulomas, suggesting an infectious process. Caseation necrosis typical of tuberculosis is absent The lungs are involved at some stage of the disease in 90% of patients. The granulomas predominantly involve the interstitium rather than air spaces, with some tendency to localize in the connective tissue around bronchioles and pulmonary venules and in the pleura ('lymphangitic' distribution). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contains abundant CD4+ T cells. In 5% to 15% of patients, the granulomas eventually are replaced by diffuse interstitial fibrosis, resulting in a so-called honeycomb lung. Intrathoracic hilar and paratracheal lymph nodes are enlarged and calcification in 75% to 90% of patients, while a third present with peripheral lymphadenopathy. The nodes are characteristically painless and have a firm, rubbery texture. Unlike in tuberculosis, lymph nodes in sarcoidosis are 'nonmatted' (nonadherent) and do not ulcerate.",C

TGF-β is involved in all of the process of angiogenesis except:,Stimulates  fibroblast migration and proliferation,Formation of the vascular lumen,Increases the synthesis of collagen,Decreases the degradation of ECM,"TGF-β stimulates fibroblast migration and proliferation, increases the synthesis of collagen and fibronectin, and decreases the degradation of ECM by inhibiting metalloproteinases. TGF-β is involved not only in scar formation after injury but also in the development of fibrosis in lung, liver, and kidneys that follows chronic inflammation.TGF-β also has anti-inflammatory effects that serve to limit and terminate inflammatory responses. It does this by inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation and the activity of other leukocytes.
VEGFs, mainly VEGF-A, stimulates both migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, thus initiating the process of capillary sprouting in angiogenesis. It promotes vasodilation by stimulating the production of NO and contributes to the formation of the vascular lumen.

Which of the following is known as the 'guardian of the genome' -,p53,Mdm2,p14,ATM,"p53; Guardian of genome

p53 is a tumor suppressor gene.
p53 gene is located on chromosome 17.
p53 acts as molecular policeman that prevents the propagation of genetically damage cell.
p53 gene product, i.e. p53 protein is a DNA binding protein in the nucleus, when called into action, it controls the transcription of several other genes.
The ma 'or functional activities of the 53 rotein are cell c cle arrest and initiation of a o v.tosis in res onse to DNA damage.
When there is DNA damage due to irradiation, UV light or mutagenic chemicals, there is rapid increase in p53 levels.
p53 causes -

Cell cycle arrest


p-53 induces transcription of p21, a CDK inhibitor.
p21 inhibit cyclin D-CDK-4 complex and there is arrest of cell cycle late in G1 phase.
This allows time for DNA repair.

DNA repair

p-53 also helps in DNA repair directly by inducing transcription of GADD 45 (growth arrest and DNA damage).
GADD 45 encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair.
If DNA damage is repaired successfully, p53 activate MDM-3 and this MDM-3 induce degradation of p-53 → Relieve in cell cycle block.
If DNA damage cannot be successfully repaired, p53 induces apoptosis by inducing the activation of apoptosis-inducing gene BAX.
So p53 prevents replication of cell with defective DNA → p53 functions as a critical gatekeeper against the formation of cancer.
Mutation in p53 leads to carcinogenesis because of loss of the above protective mechanism.
p-53 is the most common target for genetic alteration in human tumors: A little over 50% of human tumors contain mutation in this gene.

One day later, she has the right pupillary dilation and impaired ocular movement. She then becomes obtunded. Which of the following lesions best explains these findings?",Chronic subdural hematoma,Frontal lobe abscess,Glioblastoma with edema,Hydrocephalus ex vacuo,"The papilledema and the herniation are a consequence of brain swelling, typically the vasogenic form of edema from blood-brain barrier disruption adjacent to the neoplasm. A large aggressive neoplasm, such as glioblastoma, may produce a mass effect via enlargement from rapid growth, hemorrhage, and surrounding edema. The mass effect with herniation of the medial temporal lobe results in a third cranial nerve palsy as the nerve is compressed. A chronic subdural hemorrhage accumulates slowly enough that herniation may not occur. An abscess may cause a mass effect with some associated brain swelling, but this patient is afebrile. There is no pressure effect with hydrocephalus ex vacuo, which is a consequence of cerebral atrophy. An infarct is not likely to produce pronounced associated brain swelling, and a mass effect in the occipital lobe is unlikely to affect the third nerve. Rupture of a berry aneurysm produces subarachnoid hemorrhage at the base of the brain, which is less likely to cause a mass effect.",C
Multiple drug resistance is transferred through:,Transduction,Transformation,Conjugation,Mutation,"Conjugation Sexual contact through the formation of a bridge or sex pilus is common among gram-negative bacilli of the same or another species. This may involve chromosomal or extrachromosomal (plasmid) DNA. The gene carrying the &;resistance&; or &;R&; factor is transferred onlv if another &;resistance transfer factor&; (F) is also present. Conjugation frequently occurs in the colon where large variety of gram-negative bacilli come in close contact. Even nonpathogenic organisms may transfer R factor to pathogenic organisms, which may become widespread by contamination of food or water. Chloramphenicol resistance of typhoid bacilli, streptomycin resistance of E. coli, penicillin resistance of Haemophilus and gonococci and many others have been traced to this mechanism. Concomitant acquisition of multidrug resistance has ocurred by conjugation. Thus, this is a very impoant Mechanism of horizontal transmission of resistance.

All are affected in Graft-Versus host reaction :,Skin,>G.I.T,>Liver,>Lung,"Lung Graft versus host disease Graft versus host disease occurs in any situation in which immunologically competent cells or their precursors are transplanted into immunologically crippled patients and the transferred cells recognize alloantigens in the host. Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogenic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e.g. the liver) or transfusion of unirradiated blood. Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation. When such recipients receive normal bone man-ow cells from allogenic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognizes the recipient's HLA antigen as foreign antigen and react against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues. In clinical practice GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HIA matched donor and recipient. Acute GVH disease occurs within days to weeks after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Although any organ may be affected, the mayor clinical manifestation results from involvement of the immune system and epithelia of the skin, liver and intestines. Involvement of the skin in GVH disease is manifested by a generalized rash leading to desquamation in severe cases. Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice and mucosal ulceration of the gut results in bloody diarrhoea. Immunodeficiency is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease the immunodeficiency may be a result of prior treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipient's immune system and attack on host's inunune cells by grafted lymphocytes. Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections. Although many different types of organisms may infect patients, infection with cytomegalovirus is paicularly impoant.",D

Mechanism of actions of penicillins and cephalosporins is to inhibit:,Cell wall synthesis,Leakage from cell membrane,Protein synthesis,DNA gyrase,"Beta lactam These are antibiotics having a beta-lacatam ring. The two major groups are penicillins and cephalosporins. Monobactams and carbapenems are relatively newer additions. Mechanism of action All beta-lactam antibiotics interfere with the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. The P-lactam antibiotics inhibit the transpepti,iases so that cross linking (which maintains the -:lose knit structure of the cell wall) does not take rlace. These enzymes and related proteins constitute the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs)which have been located in the bacterial cell membrane. Each organism has several PBPs and PBPs obtained from different species differ in their affinity towards different P-lactam antibiotics. This fact probably explains their differing sensitivity to the various P-lactam antibiotics. When susceptible bacteria divide in the ,presence of a P-lactam antibiotic-cell wall deficient (CWD) forms are produced. Because the interior of the bacterium is hyperosmotic, the CWD forms swell and burst causing bacterial lysis. This is how P-lactam antibiotics exe bactericidal action. Cnder ceain conditions and in case of ceain organisms, bizarre shaped or filamentous forms, which are incapable of multiplying, result. Grown in hyperosmotic medium, globular' giant' forms or protoplasts are produced. Lytic effect of these antibiotics may also be due to derepression of some bacterial autolysins which normally function during cell division. Rapid cell wall synthesis occurs when the organisms are actively multiplying; P-lactam antibiotics are more lethal in this phase. The peptidoglycan cell wall is unique to bacteria.

However, in contrast to neuroleptic malignant syndrome it is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction and is generally dose related. Serotonin syndrome is due to acute overstimulation of 5-HT2A receptors caused by serotonergic drugs like SSRI (Drugs causing serotonin syndrome have been explained) Treatment of Serotonin Syndrome o Treatment of patients with serotonin syndrome begins with suppoive care and decreasing muscle rigidity. o Because muscle rigidity is thought to be paly responsible for hypehermia and death, external cooling in conjunc? tion with aggressive use of benzodiazepines should limit complication and moality. In severe cases, neuromuscular Mocker should be considered to achieve rapid muscle relaxation. Use of Cyproheptadine in patients with mild/moderate serotonin syndrome has shown effective serotonin blockage and control of symptoms. Other drugs that are antedotally repoed to be successful for the treatement of symptoms of serotonin syndrome include methysergide, chlorpromazine, atypical antipsychotics and propranolol. In most patients, the serotonin syndrome resolves within 24 hours after the offending drug is removed. o Aggressive cooling and sedation with a benzodiazepine remain the basis of therapy.",C

Which of the following BEST describes the mechanism of action of aspirin?,Aspirin decreases the serum level of factor VIII,Aspirin decreases the serum level of factor IX,Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelets,Aspirin irreversibly inhibits thrombin,"Aspirin acts as an anticoagulant by irreversibly inhibiting platelets, preventing the formation of a clot by blocking platelet adhesion and aggregation. Since this platelet mass acts as a matrix for fibrin clot formation, blocking platelets prevents clot formation. This mechanism has been utilized in patients with atherosclerotic disease to prevent intravascular clot formation, but may aggravate bleeding conditions such as this. Aspirin does not decrease the serum level of factor VIII. Factor VIII deficiency is the pathophysiology behind hemophilia A. Factor IX deficiency is associated with hemophilia. Aspirin does not inhibit thrombin. Thrombin is the enzyme responsible for cleaving fibrinogen to fibrin. Ref: Grosser T., Smyth E. (2011). Chapter 34.

Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is an acute proliferative glomerulonephritis which is characterized by diffuse proliferation of glomerular cells, associated with an influx of leukocytes.
PSGN is characterized by -

(i) Enlarged, hypercellular glomeruli that are caused by

Infiltration of leukocytes, both neutrophils and monocytes.
Proliferation of endothelial cells and mesangial cells.
Proliferation and leukocyte infiltration is diffuse, i.e. involving all lobules of all glomeruli.


In severe form → Crescent formation.
By immunofluorescence microscopy, there are granular deposits of IgG, IgM and C3 in the mesangium and along the basement membrane.
The characteristic electron microscopic findings are discrete, amorphous, electron-dense deposits on the epithelial side of the membrane, often having the appearance of humps → Subepithelial humps.
Subendothelial, intramembranous (within GBM) and mesangial deposits may be present.

Also, know
In its severe form acute diffuse proliferative GN may show rapid deterioration of renal function with the formation of the crescent in the glomeruli → it is referred as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.",D

Harrison's 17th/pg. 1789.........'Henoch-Schonlein purpura is distinguished clinically from IgA nephropathy by prominent systemic symptoms, a younger age (<20 years old), preceding infection, and abdominal complaints. Deposits of IgA are also found in the glomerular mesangium in a variety of systemic diseases, including chronic liver disease, Crohn's disease, gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, chronic obstructive bronchiectasis, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, dermatitis herpetiformis, mycosis fungoides, leprosy, ankylosing spondylitis, relapsing polychondritis, and Sjogren's syndrome. IgA deposition in these entities is not usually associated with clinically significant glomerular inflammation or renal dysfunction and thus is not called IgA nephropathy'Discussion:IgA nephropathy:# Berger first described it. It is classically characterized by episodic hematuria with the deposition of IgA in the mesangium. IgA nephropathy is one of the most common forms of glomerulonephritis worldwide. There is a male preponderance, a peak incidence in the second and third decades, and rare familial clustering.# The two most common presentations of IgA nephropathy are recurrent episodes of macroscopic hematuria during or immediately following an upper respiratory infection in children (Henoch-Schonlein purpura) or asymptomatic microscopic hematuria most often seen in adults.# Rx: - ACE inhibitors in patients with proteinuria or declining renal function.- Tonsillectomy, steroid therapy, and fish oil have all been suggested to benefit some patients.- When presenting as RPGN, patients need steroids, cytotoxic agents, and plasmapheresis.RENAL INVOLVEMENT in Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)# Microscopic hematuria (78%) and subnephrotic proteinuria (75%) are the most consistent findings.# The characteristic lesion in HUS/TTP is thrombotic microangiopathy.# Microthrombi are demonstrated in renal arterioles and capillaries.# In TTP, microthrombi are composed mainly of platelet aggregates and thin layer of fibrin and stain strongly for vWF, implicated in its pathogenesis. In contrast, microthrombi in HUS contain predominantly fibrin.# Subendothelial hyaline deposits and endothelial cell swelling also contribute to vascular occlusion. Glomerular lesions are ischemic. The glomerular capillary walls are wrinkled, the glomerular tuft may be atrophied, and the Bowman capsule is thickened. Acute cortical or tubular necrosis may occur.# Immunofluorescence studies invariably demonstrate fibrinogen along the glomerular capillary walls and in arterial thrombi. Granular deposits of C3 and IgM may be observed in vessel walls and glomeruli.# Electron-microscopic studies demonstrate swelling of the glomerular endothelial cells and detachment from the glomerular basement membrane.",A

Which of the following parameters is not monitored in a patient on methotrexate therapy:,Liver function tests,Lung function test,Eye examination,Hemogramz,"Methotrexate is an antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent that binds to the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which is involved in the synthesis of purine nucleotides. This interferes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis and disrupts cell multiplication. Methotrexate has long been known to be effective in the treatment of leukemias, lymphomas, and carcinomas of the head, neck, breast, ovary, and bladder. It has also been used as an immunosuppressive agent in the prevention of graft versus host disease and in the treatment of severe psoriasis and rheumatoid ahritis. The effectiveness of methotrexate on trophoblastic tissue has been well established and is derived from experience gained in using this agent in the treatment of hydatiform moles and choriocarcinomas. As used in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy, methotrexate is administered in a single or in multiple intramuscular (IM) injections. Treatment with methotrexate is an especially attractive option when the pregnancy is located on the cervix or ovary or in the interstitial or the cornual poion of the tube. Surgical treatment in these cases is often associated with increased risk of hemorrhage, often resulting in hysterectomy or oophorectomy. Indications Medical therapy for ectopic pregnancy involving methotrexate may be indicated in ceain patients. To determine acceptable candidates for methotrexate therapy, first establish the diagnosis by one of the following criteria: Abnormal doubling rate of the beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) level and ultrasonographic identification of a gestational sac outside of the uterus Abnormal doubling rate of the b-HCG level, an empty uterus, and menstrual aspiration with no chorionic villi A number of other factors must also be considered once the diagnosis is established, as follows: The patient must be hemodynamically stable, with no signs or symptoms of active bleeding or hemoperitoneum (must be met by every patient) The patient must be reliable, compliant, and able to return for follow-up care (must be met by every patient) The size of the gestation should not exceed 4cm at its greatest dimension (or exceed 3.5 cm with cardiac activity) on ultrasonographic measurement - Exceeding this size is a relative, but not absolute, contraindication to medical therapy Absence of fetal cardiac activity on ultrasonographic findings - The presence of fetal cardiac activity is a relative contraindication No evidence of tubal rupture - Evidence of tubal rupture is an absolute contraindication b-HCG level less than 5000 mIU/mL - Higher levels are a relative contraindication Methotrexate Treatment Protocols A number of accepted protocols with injected methotrexate exist for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy. Multiple-dose regimen Initial experience used multiple doses of methotrexate with leucovorin to minimize adverse effects. Leucovorin is folinic acid that is the end product of the reaction catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase, the same enzyme inhibited by methotrexate. Normal dividing cells preferentially absorb leucovorin; hence, it decreases the action of methotrexate, thereby decreasing methotrexate's adverse systemic effects. This regimen involves administration of methotrexate as 1 mg/kg IM on days 0, 2, 4, and 6, followed by 4 doses of leucovorin as 0.1 mg/kg on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Because of a higher incidence of adverse effects and the increased need for patient motivation and compliance, the multiple dosage regimen has fallen out of or in the United States. Single-dose regimen The more popular regimen today is the single-dose injection, which involves injection of methotrexate as 50 mg/m2 IM in a single injection or as a divided dose injected into each buttock. Studies comparing the multiple methotrexate dosage regimen with the single dosage regimen have demonstrated that the 2 methods have similar efficacy. With smaller dosing and fewer injections, fewer adverse effects are anticipated, and the use of leucovorin can be abandoned. The protocol for single-dose methotrexate is detailed below. Using this protocol, Stovall et al achieved a 96% success rate with a single injection of methotrexate. Day 0 Obtain b-HCG level, ultrasonography, and +/- dilatation and curettage. Day 1 Obtain levels of the following: b-HCG Liver function - Eg, aspaate aminotransferase (AST or serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase ), alanine aminotransferase (ALT or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase ) Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Creatinine Evidence of hepatic or renal compromise is a contraindication to methotrexate therapy.

She does, and demonstrates a BP of 195/140 with hea rate 160/min during the episode. She promptly brings him to you, but the spell is over by the time that he is seen. Urinary measurement of which of the following would most likely be diagnostic in this case",Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),17-ketosteroids,Vanillylmandelic acid VMA,"This patient's history suggests pheochromocytoma. This rare (but often considered diagnostically) tumor is most often found in the adrenal medulla, although it can also be found in other tissues derived from neural crest cells. The tumor cells secrete catecholamine hormones or their precursors, which can cause either paroxysmal (as in this case) or persistent hypeension. Urinary metabolites of epinephrine and norepinephrine are vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid, so screening 24 hour urine collections for these substances can be helpful in establishing or excluding these diagnoses even in cases in which a physician does not observe one of the paroxysms and thus blood cannot be drawn for serum catecholamine levels at that time. DHEA is the adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone (made by the adrenal coex rather than the adrenal medulla), and is measured in serum in cases where adrenal virilism is suspected. hCG is human chorionic gonadotropin, and both serum and urine levels can increase in pregnancy or trophoblastic disease. 17-ketosteroids are measured in urine during evaluation of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (a disorder of the adrenal coex rather than medulla)..",D

It has high potency to block D2 as compared to D1 receptors.It should not be used with Carbamazepine due to two reasons:Carbamazepine induces its metabolism and thus decreases the plasma concentration.Carbamazepine has bone marrow suppressant action and can add to agranulocytosis caused by Clozapine.Clozapine should be started at low doses (12.5 mg) and gradually dose should be increased. Baseline WBC counts should be measured and then weekly counts should be done atleast for first 6 months. When WBC count becomes less than 3000/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count becomes less than 1500/mm3, Clozapine should be discontinued. After discontinuation, weekly WBC counts should be less than 2000/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count below 1000/mm3 should not be started on Clozapine again.",B

The transplanted stem cells in the bone marrow give rise to normal T and B cells. Half of SCID cases are caused by an X-linked mutation in the common g chain for cytokine receptors, and the rest are due to autosomal recessive mutations in the gene encoding for adenosine deaminase, which leads to accumulation of metabolites toxic to lymphocytes. An abnormal CD40 ligand interaction with CD40 leads to lack of isotype switching in patients with hyper-IgM syndrome. The BTK gene product is required for differentiation of pro-B cells and pre-B cells, and a mutation leads to agammaglobulinemia. The 22q11 deletion is seen in infants with DiGeorge anomaly and results in lack of T cell development.

Pink puffers are associated with?,Emphysema,Chronic bronchitis,Pneumonia,Bronchiectasis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Emphysema * A 'pink puffer' is a person where emphysema is the primary underlying pathology. In emphysema, not only there is less surface area for gas exchange, there is also less vascular bed for gas exchange. The body then has to compensate by hyperventilation (the 'puffer'). Their arterial blood gases (ABGs) actually are relatively normal because of this compensatory hyperventilation. They actually have less hypoxemia (compared to blue bloaters) and appear to have a 'pink' complexion and hence 'pink puffer'. Some of the pink appearance may also be due to the work (use of neck and chest muscles) these folks put into just drawing a breath.* A 'blue bloater' is a person where the primary underlying lung pathology is chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is caused by excessive mucus production with airway obstruction resulting from hyperplasia of mucus- producing glands, goblet cell metaplasia, and chronic inflammation around bronchi. Unlike emphysema, the pulmonary capillary bed is undamaged. Instead, the body responds to the increased obstruction by decreasing ventilation and increasing cardiac output. There is a dreadful ventilation to perfusion mismatch leading to hypoxemia and polycythemia. In addition, they also have increased carbon dioxide retention (hypercapnia). Because of increasing obstruction, their residual lung volume gradually increases (the 'bloating' part). They are hypoxemic/cyanotic because they actually have worse hypoxemia than pink puffers and this manifests as bluish lips and faces--the 'blue' part.",A

Examine the above pedigree cha. Which one of the following diseases is the most likely for this situation?,Neurofibromatosis,Beta-thalassemia,Colour blindness,Vitamin D resistant rickets,"Beta thalassemias (b thalassemias) are a group of inherited blood disorders. They are forms of thalassemia caused by reduced or absent synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin that result in variable outcomes ranging from severe anemia to clinically asymptomatic individuals. Global annual incidence is estimated at 1 in 100,000. Beta thalassemias are caused by mutations in the HBB gene on chromosome 11, inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The severity of the disease depends on the nature of the mutation. HBB blockage over time leads to decreased beta-chain synthesis. The body's inability to construct new beta-chains leads to the underproduction of HbA. Reductions in HbA available overall to fill the red blood cells in turn leads to microcytic anemia. Microcytic anemia ultimately develops in respect to inadequate HBB for sufficient red blood cell functioning. Due to this factor, the patient may require blood transfusions to make up for the blockage in the beta-chains. Repeated blood transfusions can lead to build-up of iron overload, ultimately resulting in iron toxicity. This iron toxicity can cause various problems, including myocardial siderosis and hea failure leading to the patient's death.",B

These findings are typical for which of the following type of hypersensitivity immunologic responses:",Type IV,Type II,Type III,Type I,"Presence of epithelioid cell granuloma, Langhans giant cells and lymphocytes is characteristic of chronic granulomatous inflammation
Chronic granulomatous inflammation occurs when two conditions are satisfied i.e.

a. When an active T lymphocyte-mediated cellular immune response occurs.

Lymphokines produced by activated T lymphocytes inhibit migration of macrophages and cause them to aggregate in the area of injury and form granulomas.
This pathological process is characteristic of Type IV hypersensitivity (so one can say that- Type IV hypersensitivity is essential for chronic granulomatous inflammation)

b. When macrophages have successfully phagocytosed the injurious agent but it survives inside them.

Some important definitions- • Epithelioid cells - These are activated macrophages
They are large cells with abundant pale foamy cytoplasm
Epithelioid cell granuloma
An epitheloid cell granuloma is an aggregate of these activated macrophages.
Granulomas are usually surrounded by lymphocytes, plasma cells fibroblast and collagen.

Loss of hetrozygosity associated with:,Acute myeloid leukemia,ALL,Retinoblastorna,Promyelocitic leukemia,"Retinoblastoma Retinoblastoma is a prime example of a tumour which is associated with loss of heterozygosity. This term is mostly used in the context of oncogenesis. The mutations required to produce retinoblastomes involves the RB gene located on chromosome 13 q14. RB gene is a tumour suppressor gene. Retinoblastoma develops when both the normal alleles of the RB gene are inactivated or altered. In familial case of retinoblastoma, children are born with one normal and one defective copy of the RB gene. Such a child is said to be heterozygous at the RB locus (one allele of the gene is normal while the other one is a mutant) This implies that heterozygosity for the RB gene does not affect cell behaviour i.e., (cancer does not develop as long as one gene is normal) Cancer develops when both the alleles are mutant i.e., when the cell becomes homozygous for the mutant allele or you can put it in another way, when the cell loses heterozygosity for the normal PB gene (a condition known as loss of heterozygosity) Make it clear that in oncology, loss of heterozygosity occurs when the remaining functional allete in a somatic cell of the off spring becomes inactivated by mutation. This results in no normal tumour suppressor gene being produced and almost ceainly results in turnourogenesis. It is a common occurrence in cancer, where it indicates the absence of a functional tumour suppressor gene in the lost region. Loss of heterozygosity is the basis of two hit hypothesis of cancers (Knudson's hypothesis) In hereditary cases of Retinoblastoma one genetic change (first hit) is inherited from the affected parent therefore it is present in all the somatic cells of the body. But one genetic change is not sufficient to produce cancer. The second mutation (second bit) is required to produce cancer. It occurs in the retinal cells (which are carrying the first mutation). The mutation occuring in Retinal cells is acquired. In sporadic cases both mutations (hits) occur somatically within a single retinal cell whose progeny then form the tumour. This RB gene act as an example of several other genes that act similarly. Genes on chromosomes II Wilms tumour, Hepatoblastoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma VHL Familial and sporadic clear cell Ca.",C

SCA occurs more commonly in black people from pas of Sub-Saharan Africa-------------------- Internet. Effect of HbS on RBCs o In deoxygenated condition, the HbS molecules undergo polymerization and aggregation. o With continued deoxygenation, aggregated HbS molecules assemble into long needle-like fibers within red cells, producing a distoed sickle or holly-leaf shape. Sickling of red cells is reversible initialy, i.e., with oxygenation, HbS depolymerizes and cell shape normalizes. o However, with repeated episodes of deoxygenation and sickling, membrane damage occurs and cells become irreversibly sickled, and retain their abnormal shape even when full oxygenated. o With membrane damage water comes out of the cell resulting in intracellular dehydration ---> T MCHC. Due to membrane damage, sickle red cells become abnormally sticky --> responsible for microvascular occlusions. Remember o Irreversible sickle cells are responsible for hemolytic anemia. o Reversible sickle cells are responsible for vasoocclusive symptoms.",D

Which of the following is not a side effect ofnaloxone,>Seizure,>Hypeension,>Pulmonary edema,>Ventricular dysrhymia,"Seizure Opioid antagonists Naloxone is an opioid antagonists Under ordinary circumstances in normal individuals it does not produce any discernible effect. - It produces its effects only when agonistic opioids have been administered earlier to the patient. - However, if endogenous opioid system is activated as in shock or ceain forms of stress, the administration of opioid antagonist alone may have ble consequences. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist and it promptly reverses the respiratory depressant propey of opioids. - Other agnostic effects of opioids such as effects. on CNS and blood pressure is also reversed by opioids. - Naloxane is commonly used to reverse respiratory depression produced by opioid. The antagonism of opioid effects by naloxone is often accompanied by 'overshoot' phenomenon i.e.,while reversing the effect produced by the opioids it tends to overcorrect it. - The respiratory rate depressed by opioids transiently become higher than that before the period of depression. - Rebound release of catecholamine may cause 'hypeension', 'tachycardia' and 'ventricular arrhythmias'. - 'Pulmonary edema' has also been repoed after naloxone administration. Naloxone may precipitate seizures but they are seen only in patients who are addicted to or dependent on opioids. - Small subcutaneous doses of naloxone precipitates a moderate to severe withdraw! syndrome that is very similar to that seen after abrupt withdrawl of opioids excepts that the syndrome appears within minutes of administration and subsides in about 2 hours. - However, seizure cannot be considered an adverse effect of naloxone. Seizure occur as a pa of withdrawl syndrome when naloxone is administered to those who are addicted or dependent on opioids. When naloxone is administered in nonnal individuals to treat opioid overdose, it does not precipitate withdrawl syndrome and seizures do not occur. - On the other hand the cardiac effects i.e., arrhythmia, hyper- tension and pulmonary edema are produced when naloxone is administered in normal individual to reverse the effect of opioids. - These effects do not require the prior administration of opioids.",A

His  coagulation  studies  are  within normal limits. The hemoglobin electrophoresis shows the following: Hb A 60% and Hb S 40%. Which of the following is most likely true about this patient?,Irreversible sickle cells are present on the peripheral smear.,Reticulocyte count is elevated,He is protected from Plasmodium falciparum.,MCHC is decreased,"Patients who are heterozygous for the sickle cell trait (Hb AS) have hemoglobin composed of 35 to 40% hemoglobin S (HbS); they are generally protected from sickle cell crisis, aplastic crisis and sequestration crisis by the presence of > 50% normal hemoglobin (H A).
Amount of HbS Q  is the most important factor affecting sickling of the RBCs
The alteration of the hemoglobin (from HbA to HbS) reduces its solubility.
Patients with sickle cell trait are usually asymptomatic, although they may develop hematuria and a limited ability to concentrate urine. A high incidence of UTI and splenic infarction at high altitude may be seen. The heterozygotes enjoy relative protection from Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) because of increased sickling of parasitized sickle-cell trait red blood cells and accelerated removal of these cells by the splenic monocyte macrophage system.
(Choices A, B and D) Peripheral smears are usually normal in sickle cell trait patients; irreversibly sickled cells are not seen. Furthermore, red cell indices and red cell morphology are normal; the reticulate count is not elevated. However, the sickling test will be positive (RBCs will sickle when sodium metabisulfite is added). Increased MCHC, which represents intracellular dehydration, is seen only with homozygous SS (i.e. full-blown sickle cell anemia).",C

Response to iron in iron deficiency anemia is denoted by?,Restoration of enzymes,Reticulocytosis,Increase in iron binding capacity,Increase in hemoglobin,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Reticulocytosis Response to iron therapy When specific iron therapy is given, patients often show rapid subjective improvement, with disappearance or marked diminution of fatigue, lassitude, and other non-specific symptoms. This response may occur before any improvment in anemia is observed. The earliest hematological evidence of recovery is increase reticulocytes and their hemoglobin content. The reticulocytes attain a maximal value on the 5th to 10th day after institution of therapy and thereafter gradually return to nonnal. The reticulocyte response may not be detectable in mild iron deficiency anemia. The blood hemoglobin level is the most accurate measure of the degree of anemia in iron deficiency anemia. During the response to therapy, the red cell count may increase temporarily to values above normal, but the hemoglobin value lags behind. The red cell indices may remain abnormal for some time after the normal hemoglobin level is restored. As recovery occurs, a normocytic cell population gradually replaces the microcytic population; and one of the early signs of response to therapy is an increase in RBW from pretreatment level. When treatment is fully effective, hemoglobin reaches normal levels by 2 months after therapy is initiated, regardless of staing values. Of the epithelial lesions in iron deficiency, those affecting the tongue and nails are the most responsive to treatment.",B

All known effects of cyclic AMP in eukaryotic cells results from ?,Activation of the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase,Activation of synthetase,Activation of protein kinase,Phosphorylation of G protein,"Ans. 'c' i.e., Activation of protein kinase o Cyclic AMP exes most of its effects by stimulating cAMP-dependent protein kinases. These kinases are composed of a cAMP-binding regulatory (R) dimer and two catalytic (C) chains. When cAMP binds to the R dimer, active C chains are released to diffuse through the cytoplasm and nucleus, where they transfer phosphate from ATP to appropriate substrate proteins, often enzymes. The specificity of cAMP's regulatory effects resides in the distinct protein substrates of the kinases that are expressed in different cells. For example, liver is rich in phosphorylase kinase and glycogen synthase, enzymes whose reciprocal regulation by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation gov erns carbohydrate storage and release.",C

Which is the most common red cell defect without Hb abnormality,Elliptocytosis,Spherocytosis,Poikilocytosis,Sickle cell disease,"On smears, spherocytes are dark red and lack central pallor (Fig. 11-2). The excessive red cell destruction and resultant anemia lead to a compensatory hyperplasia of red cell progenitors in the marrow and an increase in red cell production marked by reticulocytosis. Splenomegaly is more common and prominent in hereditary spherocytosis than in any other form of hemolytic anemia. The splenic weight usually is between 500 and 1000 g. The enlargement results from marked congestion of the splenic cords and increased numbers of tissue macrophages. Phagocytosed red cells are seen within macrophages lining the sinusoids and, in paicular, within the cords. In long-standing cases there is prominent systemic hemosiderosis. The other general fea- tures of hemolytic anemias also are present, including cho- lelithiasis, which occurs in 40% to 50% of patients with hereditary spherocytosis. Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by abnormalities in the membrane skeleton, a network of proteins that underlies lipid bilayer of the red cell (Fig. 11-1). The major membrane skeleton protein is spectrin, a long, flexible het- erodimer that self-associates at one end and binds sho actin filaments at its other end. These contacts create a two- dimensional meshwork that is linked to the overlying mem- brane through ankyrin and band 4.2 to the intrinsic membrane protein called band 3, and through band 4.1 to glycophorin. The mutations in hereditary spherocytosis most frequently involve ankyrin, band 3, and spectrin, but mutations in other components of the skeleton have also been described. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 410",B

Mutation of which of the following gene is most impoant in paroxysmal nocturnal hemaglobinuria-,Decay accelerating factor (DAF),Membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL),Glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI),CD8 binding protein,"in PNH ,these GPI(Glycosyl Phosphatidyl Inositol) -linked proteins are deficient because of somatic mutations that inactivate PIGA.PIGA is X linked and subject to lyonisation.PNH stems from acquired mutations in gene PIGA, which is required for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG), a membrane anchor that is a component of many proteins. Without the 'PIG-tail,' these proteins cannot be expressed on the cell surface. The affected proteins include several that limit the activation of complement. As a result, PIGA-deficient precursors give rise to red cells that are inordinately sensitive to complement-mediated lysis. Leukocytes are also deficient in these protective pro- teins, but nucleated cells are generally less sensitive to com- plement than are red cells, and as a result the red cells take the brunt of the attack. The paroxysmal nocturnal hemolysis that gives the disorder its name occurs because the fixation of complement is enhanced by the slight decrease in blood pH that accompanies sleep (owing to CO2 retention). However, most patients present less dramatically with anemia due to chronic low-level hemolysis. Another complication that is often serious and sometimes fatal is venous throm- bosis. The etiopathogenesis of the prothrombotic state is somehow also related to the activity of the complement membrane attack complex, as inhibitors of this complex (described below) greatly lessen the incidence of thrombosis. Because PIGA is X-linked, normal cells have only a single active PIGA gene, mutation of which is sufficient to give rise to PIGA deficiency. Because all myeloid lineages are affected in PNH, the responsible mutations must occur in an early myeloid progenitor with self-renewal capacity. Remarkably, many normal individuals harbor small numbers of bone marrow cells bearing PIGA mutations identical to those that cause PNH. It is believed that clinically evident PNH occurs only in rare instances in which the PIGA mutant clone has a survival advantage. One setting in which this may be true is in primary bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia), which most often appears to be caused by immune-mediated destruction or suppression of marrow stem cells. It is hypoth- esized that PIGA-deficient stem cells somehow escape the immune attack and eventually replace the normal marrow elements. Targeted therapy with an antibody that inhibits the C5b-C9 membrane attack complex is effective at diminishing both the hemolysis and the thrombotic complications, but also places patients at high risk for Neisseria infections, includ- ing meningococcal sepsis.

In hemochromatosis iron not deposited in ?,Hea,Pituitary,Testis,Skin,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Testis In hemochromatosis, hypogonadism is caused by impairment of hypothalamic pituitary function and not due to deposition of Iron in the Testis. Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas. The total body content of the iron is tightly regulated, as the daily losses are matched by gastrointestinal absorption. In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0.5 to 1.0 gm/year. It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0.5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which is hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one third of which accumulates in the liver. The iron accumulation is life long, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0.5 to 1.0 gm/year. The disease manifests itself typically after 20 gm of storage iron have accumulated. The disease first mainfests itself in the fifth to sixth decades of life. Excessive iron is directly toxic to host tissues The clinical features of hemochromatosis are characterized principally by deposition of excess iron in the following organs in decreasing order of severity.",C

Vigabatrin acts by,GABA-Antagonism,GABA-Agonism,NMDA-Antagonism,Carbonic anhydrase activity,"Mechanism of Action: Vigabatrin is an irreversible inhibitor of GABA aminotransferase (GABA-T), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of GABA. It may also inhibit the vesicular GABA transpoer. Vigabatrin produces a sustained increase in the extracellular concentration of GABA in the brain. This leads to some desensitization of synaptic GABA A receptors but prolonged activation of nonsynaptic GABA A receptors that provide tonic inhibition. A decrease in brain glutamine synthetase activity is probably secondary to the increased GABA concentrations.

Exudative pleural effusion is seen in: March 2005,Pneumonia,Nephrotic syndrome,Congestive cardiac failure,Cirrhosis,"Ans. A: PneumoniaTransudative pleural effusions are defined as those effusions that are caused by systemic factors that alter the balance of the formation and absorption of pleural fluid (e.g., left ventricular failure, renal failure, hepatic failure, and cirrhosis). Exudative pleural effusions, by contrast, are caused by alterations in local factors that influence the formation and absorption of pleural fluid (e.g., bacterial pneumonia, cancer, pulmonary embolism, and viral infection. According to Light's criteria, a pleural effusion is likely exudative if at least one of the following exists:The ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein is greater than 0.5The ratio of pleural fluid LDH and serum LDH is greater than 0.6Pleural fluid LDH is greater than 0.7 times the normal upper limit for serumAdditional evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the excess fluid, and pleural fluid amylase, glucose, pH and cell counts are obtained.Pleural fluid amylase is elevated in cases of esophageal rupture, pancreatic pleural effusion, or cancer.Glucose is decreased with cancer, bacterial infections, or rheumatoid pleuritis.Pleural fluid pH is low in empyema (<7.2) and may be low in cancer.If cancer is suspected, the pleural fluid is sent for cytology.The fluid is also sent for Gram staining and culture, and, if suspicious for tuberculosisThe most common causes of exudative pleural effusions are bacterial pneumonia, cancer (with lung cancer, breast cancer, and lymphoma causing approximately 75% of all malignant pleural effusions), viral infection, and pulmonary embolism.",A

Pleomorphic adenoma is usually arisen from,Minor salivary gland,Superficial lobe,Parotid gland,Sub mandibular gland,"Pleomorphic adenomas present as painless, slow-growing, mobile discrete masses. They represent about 60% of tumors in the parotid, are less common in the submandibular glands, and are relatively rare in the minor salivary glands. 
Pleomorphic adenomas are benign tumors that consist of a mixture of ductal (epithelial) and myoepithelial cells, so they exhibit both epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation.
Epithelial elements are dispersed throughout the matrix, which may contain variable mixtures of myxoid, hyaline, chondroid (cartilaginous), and even osseous tissue. In some pleomorphic adenomas, the epithelial elements
predominate; in others, they are present only in widely dispersed foci. This histologic diversity has given rise to the alternative, albeit less preferred name mixed tumor. 
The tumors consistently overexpress the transcription factor
PLAG1, often because of chromosomal rearrangements involving the PLAG1 gene, but how PLAG1 contributes to
tumor development is unknown.
Pleomorphic adenomas typically manifest as rounded, well-demarcated masses rarely exceeding 6 cm in the greatest dimension. Although they are encapsulated, in some locations (particularly the palate), the capsule is not fully developed, and expansile growth produces protrusions into the surrounding tissues. The cut surface is grey-white and typically contains myxoid and blue translucent chondroid (cartilage-like) areas. The most striking histologic feature is their characteristic heterogeneity. Epithelial elements resembling ductal or myoepithelial cells are arranged in ducts, acini, irregular tubules, strands, or even sheets. These typically are dispersed within a mesenchyme-like background of loose myxoid tissue containing islands of chondroid and, rarely, foci of bone (Fig. 14–6).
Sometimes the epithelial cells form well-developed ducts lined by cuboidal to columnar cells with an underlying layer of deeply chromatic, small myoepithelial cells. In other instances, there may be strands or sheets of myoepithelial cells. Islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium also may be present. In most cases, no epithelial dysplasia or mitotic activity is evident. No difference in biologic behaviour has been observed between the tumors composed largely of epithelial elements and those composed largely of mesenchymal elements.",C

The high levels of cytokines can lead to capillary leak and shock. Superantigens made by S. aureus and S. pyogenes cause toxic shock syndrome (TSS).Superantigens do not require processing and therefore are able to bind to MHC II molecules outside the peptide-binding cleft.TSST-1 stimulates most T-cells by binding directly to MHC-II and T-cell receptors.

"During heterosexual intercourse, seminal fluid containing HIV contacts vaginal squamous mucosa. Cells capture virions and transport the virus via lymphatics to regional lymph nodes. Within the germinal centers of these lymph nodes, the virions infect CD4+ lymphocytes and proliferate, causing CD4+ cell lysis with release of more virions, which are taken up on the surface of cells having Fc receptors, allowing continued infection by HIV of more CD4+ cells passing through the nodes. Which of the following types of cells is most likely to capture HIV on its surface via Fc receptors?",B lymphocyte,CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocyte,Follicular dendritic cell,Natural Killer cell,"Dendritic cells are a form of antigen-presenting cell. Dendritic cells in epithelia are known as Langerhans cells, and those within germinal centers are called follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). The FDCs may become infected but not killed by HIV. They have cell surface Fc receptors that capture antibody-coated HIV virions through the Fc portion of the antibody. These virions attached to the FDCs can infect passing CD4+ lymphocytes. Dendritic cells elaborate type I interferons that up-regulate antiviral proteins in neighboring cells. B cells are a component of humoral immunity, and antibody to HIV does not serve a protective function, but allows serologic detection of infection. CD8+ cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that lack the receptor necessary for infection by HIV. Because they survive selectively, the CD4+:CD8+ ratio is reversed so that it is typically less than 1 with advanced HIV infection. Innate lymphoid cells resemble NK cells, but shape further lymphoid reactions. Langhans giant cells are 'committees' of activated macrophages that are part of a granulomatous response. Macrophages are a type of antigen- presenting cell that can become infected by HIV without destruction. Mast cells have surface-bound IgE, which can be cross-linked by antigens (allergens) to cause degranulation and release of vasoactive amines, such as histamine, as part of anaphylaxis with type I hypersensitivity.",C

Histopathology of a lung cancer shows 'Clara cells' probable diagnosis is -,Squamous cell cancer,Bronchio alveolar cancer,Large cell cancer,Papillary carcinoma,"Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma 

It is a histological type of adenocarcinoma.
It occurs in the pulmonary parenchyma in the terminal bronchioloalveolar pattern.
The tumor is almost always in the peripheral portion of the lung.
More often it occurs as multiple diffuse nodules that sometimes coalesce to produce a pneumonia-like consolidation.
The key feature of bronchioloalveolar carcinomas is their growth along preexisting structures without destruction of the alveolar architecture. This growth pattern has been termed 'lepidic' an allusion to the neoplastic cells resembling butterflies sitting on a fence.
Stromal, vascular or pleural invasion is characteristically absent.
Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma consists of mucin-secreting bronchiolar cells, Clara cells, or rarely type II pneumocytes.
These tend to have aerogenous spread and patient usually dies of suffocation (not by metastatic spread).

Esmoprazole acts by inhibiting,H+K+ ATPase pump,H+Na+ ATPase pump,H+ pump,Any of the above,"Ans. a (H+K+ ATPase pump). (Ref. Harrison's internal medicine, 16th ed., 1753)Esmoprazole# s-enantiomer of omeprazole.# It is claimed to produce better control of pH in stomach than omeprazole in GERD.# It is effective as Omez in healing gastric/duodenal ulcer and in inhibiting H. pylori.# Side effects and drug reactions are same as Omez.Rabeprazole,A newer PPI causing fastest acid suppression and aids ingastric mucin synthesis.PantoprazoleMore acid stable and active at high pH and drug interactions are minimal.LansoprazoleReversible inhibitor. Proton Pump (H+,K+-ATPase) Inhibitors# Omeprazole, esmoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole are substituted benzimidazole derivatives that covalently bind and irreversibly inhibit H+,K+-ATPase.# Esmoprazole, the newest member of this drug class, is the S-enantiomer of omeprazole.# These are the most potent acid inhibitory agents available.# Omeprazole and lansoprazole are the PPIs that have been used for the longest time. Both are acid-labile and are administered as enteric-coated granules in a sustained-release capsule that dissolves within the small intestine at a pH of 6. These agents are lipophilic compounds; upon entering the parietal cell, they are protonated and trapped within the acid environment of the tubulovesicular and canalicular system. These agents potently inhibit all phases of gastric acid secretion. Onset of action is rapid, with a maximum acid inhibitory effect between 2 and 6 h after administration and duration of inhibition lasting up to 72-96 h. With repeated daily dosing, progressive acid inhibitory effects are observed, with basal and secretagogue-stimulated acid production being inhibited by >95% after 1 week of therapy# The half-life of PPIs is --18 h; thus, it can take between 2 and 5 days for gastric acid secretion to return to normal levels once these drugs have been discontinued.# PPIs may interfere with absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin, iron, and digoxin. Hepatic cytochrome P450 can be inhibited by the earlier PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole). Rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esmoprazole do not appear to interact significantly with drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Caution should be taken when using warfarin, diazepam, atazanavir, and phenytoin concomitantly with PPIs. Long-term acid suppression, especially with PPIs, has been associated with a higher incidence of community-acquired pneumonia.# Tenatoprazole is a PPI containing an imidazopyridine ring instead of a benzimidazole ring, which promotes irreversible proton pump inhibition. This agent has a longer half-life than the other PPIs and may be beneficial for inhibiting nocturnal acid secretion, which has significant relevance in GERD. A second new class of agents is the potassium- competitive acid pump antagonists (P-CABs). These compounds inhibit gastric acid secretion via potassium competitive binding of the H+,K+-ATPase.",A

Calcineurin activates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) by dephosphorylation. Activated NFAT migrates to nucleus and induce transcription of cytokines IL-2 and other cytokinase.

Preferred biomarker for acute myocardial disease?,Serum LDH,Cardiac Troponin I and II,CKMB,CKBB,"Ans. b (Cardiac Troponin I and II) (Ref. Harrison's medicine 17th ed., Ch. 238-239)CARDIAC BIOMARKERS# Patients with Unstable Angina who have elevated biomarkers of necrosis, such as CK-MB and troponin (a much more specific and sensitive marker of myocardial necrosis), are atrisk for death or recurrent MI.# Elevated levels of these markers distinguish patients with NSTEMI from those with UA. There is a direct relationship between the degree of troponin elevation and mortality.# However, minor troponin elevations have been reported and can be caused by congestive heart failure, myocarditis, or pulmonary embolism, or they may be false-positive readings. Thus, in patients with an unclear history, small troponin elevations may not be diagnostic of an ACS.In the first 6 hours, ECG is the gold standard. Cardiac troponin I rises after 4 hours and is*for 7-10 days; more specific than other protein markers. CK-MB is predominantly found in myocardium but can also be released from skeletal muscle.Useful in diagnosing reinfarction following acute Ml because levels return to normal after 48 hours.

There is no sex predilection. They are relatively common lesions and are identified in 5.6% of adult autopsies. They represent a type of ductal plate malformation resulting from a remodeling deficiency of the primitive ductal plate. VMCs are small, gray-white, round or slightly irregular lesions, usually measuring less than 5 mm. Often multiple, they occur at the capsular surface or deeper within the liver parenchyma. They are located adjacent to or within poal tracts. They consist of numerous small to medium-sized irregularly shaped, often branched dilated ductules with flattened lining and bland nuclei, embedded in a dense fibrotic tissue.

Because of their dual blood supply, aerial occlusion of either the hepatic aery or the poal vein rarely results in liver infarcts. However, thrombosis of branches of the hepatic aery may result in a pale (anemic) infarct, or possibly a hemorrhagic infarct due to blood flow from the poal vein. In contrast, occlusion of the poal vein, which may be caused by cirrhosis or malignancy, may result in a wedge-shaped red area called an infarct of Zahn. This is a misnomer, however, since it is not really an infarction but instead is the result of focal sinusoidal congestion. Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome) is associated with polycythemia vera, pregnancy, and oral contraceptives. Clinically, Budd-Chiari syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, ascites, tender hepatomegaly, and hematemesis. Occlusion of the central veins, called venoocclusive disease, may be rarely seen in Jamaican drinkers of alkaloid-containing bush tea, but is much more commonly found following bone marrow transplantation (up to 25% of allogenic marrow transplants).

Intra-Venous drug (s) that can be used in management of hypertensive emergency?,Hydralaxine,Sodium nitroprusside,Esmolol,All of the above,"Ans. D. All of the above. (Ref Harrison 18th/pg. Table 247-10).Commonly used drugs Hypertensive emergency include nitroprusside, nicardipine, clevidipine, labetalol, and fenoldopam. Note that Nitroprussid is Short acting;>>cGMP via direct release of NO. Can cause cyanide toxicity (releases cyanide). Fenoldopam is a Dopamine D1 receptor agonist--coronary, peripheral, renal, and splanchnic vasodilation. Reduces BP and increases natriuresis. Clevidipine is latest generation dihydropyridine Ca channel antagonist available for IV administration (available as lipid emulsion). It is effective in Rx acute both pre-op and post-op hypertension.Usual Intravenous Doses of Antihypertensive Agents Used in Hypertensive Emergencies.Antihypertensive agentIntravenous doseNitroprussideInitial 0.3 (g/kg)/min; usual 2-4 (g/kg)/min; maximum 10 (g/kg)/min for 10 minNicardipineInitial 5 mg/h; titrate by 2.5 mg/h at 5-15 min intervals; max 15 mg/hLabetalol2 mg/min up to 300 mg or 20 mg over 2 min, then 40-80 mg at 10-min intervals up to 300 mg total Labetalol2 mg/min up to 300 mg or 20 mg over 2 min, then 40-80 mg at 10-min intervals up to 300 mg totalEsmololInitial 80-500 g/kg over 1 min, then 50-300 (g/kg)/minPhentolamine5-15 mg bolusNitroglycerinInitial 5 g/min, then titrate by 5 g/min at 3-5-min intervals; if no response is seen at 20 g/min, incremental increases of 10-20 g/min may be usedHydralazine10-50 mg at 30-min intervals# Malignant hypertension is a syndrome associated with an abrupt increase of blood pressure in a patient with underlying hypertension or related to the sudden onset of hypertension in a previously normotensive individual. The absolute level of blood pressure is not as important as its rate of rise. Pathologically, the syndrome is associated with diffuse necrotizing vasculitis, arteriolar thrombi, and fibrin deposition in arteriolar walls. Fibrinoid necrosis has been observed in arterioles of kidney, brain, retina, and other organs.# Initial goal of therapy is to reduce mean arterial blood pressure by no more than 25% within minutes to 2 h or to a blood pressure in the range of 160/100-110 mmHg. This may be accomplished with IV nitroprusside, a short-acting vasodilator with a rapid onset of action that allows for minute-to-minute control of blood pressure. Parenteral labetalol and nicardipine are also effective agents for the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy.# In patients with malignant hypertension without encephalopathy or another catastrophic event, it is preferable to reduce blood pressure over hours or longer rather than minutes. This goal may effectively be achieved initially with frequent dosing of short-acting oral agents such as captopril, clonidine, and labetalol.# Currently, in the absence of other indications for acute therapy, for patients with cerebral infarction who are not candidates for thrombolytic therapy, one recommended guideline is to institute antihypertensive therapy only for patients with a systolic blood pressure >220 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure >130 mmHg. If thrombolytic therapy is to be used, the recommended goal blood pressure is <185 mmHg systolic pressure and <110 mmHg diastolic pressure. In patients with hemorrhagic stroke, suggested guidelines for initiating antihypertensive therapy are systolic >180 mmHg or diastolic pressure >130 mmHg. The management of hypertension after subarachnoid hemorrhage is controversial. Cautious reduction of blood pressure is indicated if mean arterial pressure is >130 mmHg.# In addition to pheochromocytoma, an adrenergic crisis due to catecholamine excess may be related to cocaine or amphetamine overdose, clonidine withdrawal, acute spinal cord injuries, and an interaction of tyramine-containing compounds with monamine oxidase inhibitors. These patients may be treated with phentolamine or nitroprusside.Preferred Parenteral Drugs for Selected Hypertensive EmergenciesHypertensive encephalopathyMalignanthypertension (when IV therapy is indicated)Nitroprusside, nicardipine, labetalol Labetalol, nicardipine, nitroprusside, enalaprilatStrokeNicardipine, labetalol, nitroprussideMyocardial infarction/unstable anginaNitroglycerin, nicardipine, labetalol, esmololAcute left ventricular failureNitroglycerin, enalaprilat, loop diureticsAortic dissectionNitroprusside, esmolol, labetalolAdrenergic crisisPhentolamine, nitroprussidePostoperative hypertensionNitroglycerin, nitroprusside, labetalol, nicardipinePreeclampsia/eclampsia of pregnancyHydralazine, labetalol, nicardipine",D
Earliest manifestation of megaloblastic anaemia is,Macrocytosis,Hypersegmented neutrophils,Basophilic stippling,Cabot ring,"What Are the Symptoms of Megaloblastic Anemia? shoness of breath. muscle weakness. abnormal paleness of the skin. glossitis (swollen tongue) loss of appetite/weight loss. diarrhea. nausea. fast heabeat MORPHOLOGY Ceain morphologic features are common to all forms of megaloblastic anemia. The bone marrow is markedly hyper- cellular and contains numerous megaloblastic erythroid pro- genitors. Megaloblasts are larger than normal erythroid progenitors (normoblasts) and have delicate, finely reticu- lated nuclear chromatin (indicative of nuclear immaturity) (Fig. 11-11). As megaloblasts differentiate and acquire hemo- globin, the nucleus retains its finely distributed chromatin and fails to undergo the chromatin clumping typical of normo- blasts. The granulocytic precursors also demonstrate nuclear- cytoplasmic asynchrony, yielding giant metamyelocytes. Megakaryocytes may also be abnormally large and have bizarre multilobed nuclei. In the peripheral blood the earliest change is the appear- ance of hypersegmented neutrophils, which appear before the onset of anemia. Normal neutrophils have three or four nuclear lobes, but in megaloblastic anemias they often have five or more. The red cells typically include large, egg- shaped macro-ovalocytes; the mean cell volume often is greater than 110 fL (normal, 82 to 92 fL). Although macro- cytes appear hyperchromic, in reality the mean cell hemoglo- bin concentration is normal. Large, misshapen platelets also may be seen. Morphologic changes in other systems, espe- cially the gastrointestinal tract, also occur, giving rise to some of the clinical manifestations. Refer robbins 9/e pg 422",B
Drug resistance transmitting factor present in bacteria is:,Plasmid,Chromosome,Intros,Centromere,"Drug resistance: It refers to unresponsiveness of a microorganism to an AMA, and is akin to the phenomenon of tolerance seen in higher organisms. Resistance may be developed by mutation or gene transfer: Gene transfer (infectious resistance) from one organism to another can occur by: 1.Conjugation: Sexual contact through the formation of a bridge or sex pilus is common among gram-negative bacilli of the same or another species. This may involve chromosomal or extrachromosomal (plasmid) DNA. The gene carrying the &;resistance&; or &;R&; factor is transferred onlv if another &;resistance transfer factor&; (F) is also present. Conjugation frequently occurs in the colon where large variety of gram-negative bacilli come in close contact. Even nonpathogenic organisms may transfer R factor to pathogenic organisms, which may become widespread by contamination of food or water. 2.Transduction: It is the transfer of gene carrying resistance through the agency of a bacteriophage. The R factor is taken up by the phage and delivered to another bacterium which it infects. 3.Transformation :A resistant bacterium may release the resistance carrying DNA into the medium and this may be imbibed by another sensitive organism-becoming unresponsive to the drug. This mechanism is probably not clinically significant except isolated instances of pneumococcal resistance to penicillin G due to altered penicillin binding protein, and some other cases. Resistance once acquired by any of theabove mechanisms becomes prevalent due to the selection pressure of a widely used AMA, i.e. presence of che AMA provides oppounity for the resistant subpopulation to thrive in preference to the sensitive population ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K.D.TRIPATHI SIXTH EDITION PAGE NO:670,671",A

"All are features of hepatocellular carcinoma, except?",Not common in Asian,Liver biopsy is diagnostic,Raised titre of HBV and HCV antibodies,Fibrolameller type is having good prognosis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Not common in Asians Hepatocellular carcinoma Primary hepatocellular carcinoma is especially prevalent in regions of Asia and Africa. The largest number of cases are found in Asia followed by Africa. o More than 85% of cases of HCC occurs in countries with high rates of chronic HBV infection. In these regions HBV carrier state begins in infancy following veical transmission of virus from infected mothers, conferring a 200 fold increased risk for HCC by adulthood. Other major etiological associations for liver carcinoma are ? o Chronic alcoholism o Tyrosinemia o Food contaminants (primarily aflatoxins derived from Aspergillus flavus) o Hereditary hemochromatosis Clinical features of hepatocellular carcinoma ? o The clinical manifestations of hepatocellular carcinoma are not characteristic of hepatocellular carcinoma. The symptoms of hepatocellular carcinoma are often masked by symptoms of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. o In most cases hepatocellular carcinoma presents as an ill defined upper abdominal pain and an abdominal mass. o Elevated level of serum alphafetoproteins are seen in 50 - 75% cases. o Hepatocellular carcinomas have a strong propensity for invasion of vascular channels. Extensive intrahepatic metastasis occurs and the tumour occasionally invades the poal vein or inferior venacava. o Unresected hepatocellular carcinoma has a very poor prognosis. Patients rarely survive beyond 4 months after the diagnosis. The 5 year survival rate after curative resection is 35% to 50%. o The fibrolamellar variant of the HCC is associated with a more ourable prognosis.

All of the following is true except,NADPH oxidase acts superoxide ions,Chediak-Higashi syndrome is due to defective phagolysosome formation,In Brutons agammaglobulinemia opsonisation is not affected,Myeloperodixase action is mainly due to OCI,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., In Brutons agammaglobulinemia opsonisation is not affected o During phagocytosis there is rapid respiratory burst which is brought about by rapid burst in the activity of NADPH oxidase. o Increased NADPH oxidase activity leads to increased oxidative proesses and there by increased production of superoxide anion (0,-) Superoxide is then conveed to hydrogen peroxide (H202) free radical. o The H202 generated by NADPH oxidase system is not able to kill the bacteria itself. However, the azurophilic granules of the neutrophils contain the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) which in presence of halide such as CI-conves H20, to hypochlorite (HOCI). o Hypochlorite (HOCI) is a potent antimicrobicidal agent that destroys microbes by halogenation. o The H202 - MPO - halide system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils. Chediak higashi syndrome o It is an autosomal recessive disorder. o Chediak higashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene. o This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes. o Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins. o During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias. o Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phatosome to form nhaeolysosome.Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation. o As a result, most people with chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening. o Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected. o The other cells involved are - Melanosomes of melanocytes Dense bodies of platelets Granules of schwann cells o There are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells. o In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism i.e the colour ofskin, hair and eye is reduced. o Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders. o Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy. o Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase (lymphoma like stage). o This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E.B.virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. o The accelarated phase is associated with lever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death. About option 'c' o Antibodies help in opsonization of encapsulated bacterias such as staphylococcus aureus, H influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae. o The polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the encapsulated bacteria is a potent virulent agent. It protects the bacteria from phagocytosis. o These bacterias can only be phagocytosed when they are opsonised (coated) with specific proteins (opsonins). Opsonized (coated) bacterias become attractive targets for phagocytes because phagocytes express high affinity receptors for opsonins. o The major opsonins present in the body are IgG antibody and C3b complement. o In Bruton's agammaglobulinemia antibodies are absent therefore opsonisation is defective.",C

Drug used in anaphylaxis: September 2011,Norepinephrine,Epinephrine,Dopamine,Antihistaminics,"Ans. B: Epinephrine Adrenaline 1:1000 solution intramuscularly produces a dramatic reversal of the hypotension, bronchospasm and laryngeal edema and is life saving. Anaphylaxis It is defined as 'a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death'. It can result in a number of symptoms including throat swelling, an itchy rash, and low blood pressure. On a pathophysiologic level it is an acute multi-system type I hypersensitivity reaction. 'True' anaphylaxis is caused by degranulation of mast cells or basophils mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE), and pseudo-anaphylaxis occurs without IgE mediation The most common areas affected include: skin (80% to 90%), respiratory (70%), gastrointestinal (30% to 45%), hea and vasculature (10% to 45%), and central nervous system (10% to 15%) Skin involvement may include generalized hives, itchiness, flushing, and swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat. Respiratory symptoms may include shoness of breath, wheezes or stridor, and low oxygen. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Anaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common triggers include insect bites or stings, foods, medication, and latex rubber. Foods are the most common trigger in children and young adults while medications and insect bites and stings are more common in older adults. Biphasic anaphylaxis is the recurrence of symptoms within 1-72 hours with no fuher exposure to the allergen. Anaphylactic shock is anaphylaxis associated with systemic vasodilation that results in low blood pressure. It is also associated with severe bronchoconstriction to the point where the individual is unable to breathe. Pseudoanaphylaxis has a similar presentation and treatment to that of anaphylaxis, however, it does not involve an allergic reaction but is due to direct mast cell degranulation. This can result from morphine, radiocontrast, aspirin and muscle relaxants. Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis with no absolute contraindication to its use. It is recommended that it be given intramuscularly into the mid anterolaterial thigh as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. Minor adverse effects from epinephrine include tremors, anxiety, headaches, and palpitations.",B

'Pseudopalisading' arrangement of malignant cells is characteristic of:,Glioblastoma,Ependymoma,Oligodendroglioma,Medulloblastoma,"'The highest grade tumor of astrocytoma, known as glioblastoma, has a histologic appearance similar to anaplastic astrocytoma with the additional features of necrosis and vascular or endothelial cell proliferation and pseudo-palisading nuclei.'

Glioblastoma is type of infiltrating astrocytoma (Classified as Grade 4).
Necrosis in glioblastoma often results in a SERPENTINE pattern in areas of hyper-cellularity.
Tumor cells collect along the edges of the necrotic regions, producing histologic pattern referred to as pseudopalisading pattern.

GLIOMAS
Gliomas are tumors of the brain parenchyma that histologically resemble different types of glial cells. The major types of tumor in this category are:
a. Astrocytomas
b. Oligodendrogliomas
c. Ependymomas.

ASTROCYTOMAS

Two major categories of astrocytoma, infiltrating and non-infiltrating types.
Infiltrating astrocytomas account for about 80% of adult primary brain tumors.
They are most frequent in the fourth through sixth decades.
They are usually found in the cerebral hemispheres.
The most common presenting signs and symptoms are seizures, headaches and focal neurologic deficits related to the anatomic site of involvement.
Infiltrating astrocytomas show a spectrum of histologic differentiation that correlates well with clinical course and outcome.

Based on the degree of differentiation, they are classified into four groups:

Pilocytic astrocytoma - Grade I - Most common
Astrocytoma - Grade 2
Anaplastic astrocytoma - Grade 3
Glioblastoma multiforme - Grade 4 - Least differentiated

PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA

Pilocytic astrocytomas are relatively benign tumors, often cystic, that typically occur in children and young adults.
They are usually located in the cerebellum; also in the floor and walls of the third ventricle, the optic nerves, and occasionally the cerebral hemispheres.
A pilocytic astrocytoma is often cystic, with a mural nodule in the wall of the cyst; if solid, it is usually well circumscribed.
The tumor is composed of areas with bipolar cells with long, thin “'hairlike” processes that are GFAP positive: Rosenthal fibers, eosinophilic granular bodies, and microcysts are often present.
Necrosis and mitoses are absent.

OLIGODENDROGLIOMAS

These tumors constitute about 5% to 15% of gliomas and are most common in the fourth and fifth decades.
Patients may have had several years of neurologic complaints, often including seizures. The lesions are found mostly in the cerebral hemispheres, with a predilection for white matter.
Oligodendrogliomas are infiltrative tumors that form gelatinous, gray masses, and may show cysts, focal hemorrhage and calcification.
On microscopic examination, the tumor is composed of sheets of regular cells with spherical nuclei containing finely granular chromatin (similar to normal oligodendrocytes) surrounded by a clear halo of cytoplasm.
The tumor typically contains a delicate network of anastomosing capillaries. Calcification, present in as many as 90% of these tumors, ranges from microscopic foci to massive depositions.
With increasing cell density, nuclear anaplasia, increased mitotic activity and necrosis, the tumor becomes higher grade (anaplastic oligodendroglioma.)
Patients with oligodendrogliomas have a better prognosis than do patients with astrocytomas.
Current treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy yields an average survival of 5 to 10 years.
Patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma have a worse prognosis.

EPENDYMOMAS

Ependymomas most often arise next to the ependyma-lined ventricular system, including the central canal of the spinal cord.
In the first two decades of life, they typically occur near the fourth ventricle and constitute 5% to 10% of the primary brain tumors in this age group.
In adults, the spinal cord is their most common location; tumors in this site are particularly frequent in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 2.
Because ependymomas usually grow within the ventricles. CSF dissemination is a common occurrence.
In the fourth ventricle, ependymomas are typically solid or papillary masses extending from the floor of the ventricle.
These tumors are composed of cells with regular, round to oval nuclei with abundant granular chromatin.
Between the nuclei there is a variably dense fibrillary background.
Tumor cells may form round or elongated structures (rosettes, canals) that resemble the embryologic ependymal canal, with long, delicate processes extending into a lumen. More frequently present are perivascular pseudo-rosettes in which tumor cells are arranged around vessels with an intervening zone consisting of thin ependymal processes directed toward the wall of the vessel.
Anaplastic ependymomas show increased cell density, high mitotic rates, necrosis and less evident ependymal differentiation.
The clinical outcome for completely resected supratentorial and spinal ependymomas is better than for those in the posterior fossa.",A
Following is true about GnRH agonists except ?,Used in cases of precocious pubey,They have action similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone,Long acting preparations can be used as nasal spray,Ganirelix is the most potent agent,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Ganirelix is the most potent agent GnRH agonists Long acting GnRH (LHRH) agonists causes reversible pharmacological orchiectomy (medical castration) and are used for precocious pubey, prostatic carcinoma, endometriosis, premenopausal breast cancer, uterine leiomyoma, polycystic ovarian disease and to assist induced ovulation. GnRH agonists have action similar to Gonadotropin releasing hormone, i.e., they increase the secretion of gonadotropins (FSH, LH). Then how do they suppress gonadol function ? Lets see. GnRH agonists increases Gn secretion. But after 1-2 weeks they cause desensitization and down-regulation of FSH/LH receptors. (continous exposure to agonist may cause down regulation of receptors) --> suppression of gonadal function. Spermatogenesis/ovulation cease and testosterone/estrogen levels fall to castration level because the action of Gonadotropins (FSH & LH) is not there (these hormones promote gametogenesis and secretion of gonadal hormones). Preparation of superactive GnRH analogues are --> Busereline, Goserelin, Leuprolide, Nafarelin, Triptorelin. Superactive/Long acting GnRH are used as nasal spray or SC injection. Cetrorelix, ganirelix and abarelix are GnRh antagonists. These are used subcutanously for the treatment of uterine fibroid & endoinetriosis and for controlled ovarian stimulation in in-vitro feilization. GnRh agonists as well as GnRh antagonists can cause hot flushes, loss of libido and osteoporosis as adverse effects.",D

The protein is located on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane of muscle cells and is linked to it by integral membrane glycoproteins (dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex), which in turn, are bound to extracellular laminin. It has been proposed that the absence of dystrophin leads to a defective membrane that is damaged during contraction, an effect that predisposes to death of the myocyte.

Increased osmotic fragility is characteristic of:September 2009,Hereditary spherocytosis,Sickle cell anemia,Thalassemia,Iron deficiency anemia,"Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosisThe normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility.Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0.5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq/L).Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0.30% NaC1 solution. Decreased osmotic fragility is associated with chronic liver disease, iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hyponatremia (Na < 130 meq/ L), polycythemia vera, and sickle cell anemia after splenectomy.",A

Microscopic sections from this red, indurated area are most likely to reveal",Duct ectasia with numerous plasma cells,Extensive invasion of dermal lymphatics,Infiltrating malignant ducts surrounded by numerous neutrophils,Malignant vascular tumor forming slitlike spaces,"Inflammatory breast carcinoma is often misunderstood because of the qualifying adjective inflammatory. The term does not refer to the presence of inflammatory cells, abscess, or any special histologic type of breast carcinoma; rather, it refers to more of a clinical phenomenon, in that the breast is swollen, erythematous, and indurated and demonstrates a marked increase in warmth. These changes are caused by widespread lymphatic and vascular permeation within the breast itself and in the deep dermis of the overlying skin by breast carcinoma cells. The clinical induration and erythema are presumably related to lymphatic-vascular blockage by tumor cells; if present, these findings mean a worse prognosis.

At the α1D-adrenoceptors of the rat aorta, tamsulosin acted as a competitive antagonist with a high affinity (pKB=10.1).
At the α1B-adrenoceptor of the rat spleen and rabbit corpus cavernosum penis, tamsulosin again acted as a competitive antagonist but with a significantly lower affinity (pKB=8.9–9.2).
Tamsulosin acted as an insurmountable antagonist of the α1A-adrenoceptor-mediated responses of the rat and human vas deferens, reducing maximal responses to phenylephrine by 20% and 50%, respectively, at an antagonist concentration of 1 nm. Responses of depolarized (100 mm KCl) rat vas deferens preparations were unaffected by 10 nm tamsulosin but this concentration reduced maximal responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in this tissue.

Paternal 15 chromosome deletion is seen in -,Angelman syndrome,Prader Willi syndrome,Down syndrome,Turner syndrome,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder due to loss of function of specific genes. In newborns symptoms include weak muscles, poor feeding, and slow development. In childhood the person becomes constantly hungry which often leads to obesity and type 2 diabetes. There is also typically mild to moderate intellectual impairment and behavioral problems. Often the forehead is narrow, hands and feet small, height sho, skin light in color, and they are unable to have children. About 70% of cases occur when pa of the father's chromosome 15 is deleted. In another 25% of cases the person has two copies of chromosome 15 from their mother and none from their father. As pas of the chromosome from the mother are turned off they end up with no working copies of ceain genes. PWS is not generally inherited but instead the genetic changes happen during the formation of the egg, sperm, or in early development. There are no known risk factors. Those who have one child with PWS have less than a 1% chance of the next child being affected.] A similar mechanism occurs in Angelman syndrome except there is a defective chromosome 15 from the mother or two copies from the father. Prader-Willi syndrome has no cure. Treatment, however, may improve outcomes, especially if carried out early. In newborns feeding difficulties may be suppoed with feeding tubes. Strict food supervision is typically required staing around the age of three in combination with an exercise program. Growth hormone therapy also improves outcomes.",B
"Final common metabolism of atracurium, mivacurium and succinylcholine are by:",Conjugation,Reduction,Hydrolysis,Acetylation,"Ans: c (Hydrolysis) Ref: KDT, 6 ed, p.25, 345; Harper 27 ed, p.96The final common pathway in the metabolism of all the three involves hydrolysis by an esterase.The cleavage of a drug molecule by taking up a water molecule; occurs in liver, intestine, plasma and other tissues.E.g.: choline esters, lignocaine, procaine, procainamide, pethidine, oxytocin, atracurium, mivacurium.Atracurium:1) Usually inactivated by spontaneous nonenzymatic degradation (Hoffman elimination)2) One small fraction is eliminated by hydrolysis by cholinesterase.Mivacurium:Shortest acting competitive blocker, rapidly metabolised by plasma cholinesterases.Succinvlcholine:Shortest acting depolarizing muscle relaxant which is hydrolysed by plasma pseudocholinesterase to succinyl monocholine and then succinic acid and choline.Action lasts only for 3-5 min.

Methotrexate resistance occurs by,Depletion of folate,Overproduction of DHFR,Deficiency of thymidylate synthase,Deficiency of thiamine kinase,Overproduction of DHFR Mechanism of action of methotrexate Methotrexate enter the cell by reduced folate carrier Once inside the cell methotrexate is polyglutamylated. The polyglutamylated.forms of methotrexate are potent inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase The polyglutamased.forms of methotrexate are conveed back to monoglutamate .form in lysosomes by the glytamyl hydrolase and is subsequently effluxed from the cell Methotrexate resistance can occur through any of the following five mechanism Decreased entry into the cell due to impaired transpo Decreased retention as a consequence of lack of pohyglutammate formation An increase in DHFR An altered mutated DHFR that binds less avidly than the normal enzyme to the drug. Increased level of lysosomal enzyme 2 glutamyl hydrolase that hydrolyse methotrexate polyglutamates Decreased transpo A common mechanism of methotrexate resistance is reduced.folale transpo carrier The decreased transpo is common mechanism to methotrexate resistance in relapsed ALL. Impaired Polyglutammation The polyglutammated.forms of methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. The intracellular content of polyglutammate derivatives of methotrexate is controlled by a balance between folypolyglutamate synthetase and glutamyl hydrolase activity. Folypolyglutamate synthetase produces polyglutammate while A glutamyl hydrolase conves its bact to monoglutamate form A lower content of methotrexate polyglutamate could he due to decreased synthesis or an increased catabolism of methotrexate polyglutamates by A glutamate hydrolase. Increased DHFR The main mechanism of action of methotrexate is inhibition of the enzyme DHFR. - Methotrexate is a tight binding inhibitor of DHFR and the concentration of methotrexate required to achieve enzyme activity increases in direct propoion to the amount of enzyme in target cells. - If is now well established that an impoant mechanism of resistance of cells to methotrexate is an increase in DHFR production due to amphification of the DHFR gene Mutation in DHFR Mutation is DHFR genes may be responsible .for methotrexate resistance. Mutation in DHFR causes production of altered forms of DHFR that have decreased affinity.for the inhibitor.,B

Aschoff bodies in the myocardium are the hallmark of carditis associated with,Infective endocarditis,Rheumatic fever,Rheumatoid ahritis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,"Acute rheumatic fever is characterized by discrete inflammatory foci within a variety of tissues. The myocardial inflammatory lesions--called Aschoff bodies--are pathognomonic for rheumatic fever these are collections of lymphocytes (primarily T cells), scattered plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cells occasionally punctuating zones of fibrinoid necrosis. The Anitschkow cells have abundant cytoplasm and central nuclei with chromatin condensed to form a slender, wavy ribbon (so-called caterpillar cells). During acute rheumatic fever, Aschoff bodies can be found in any of the three layers of the hea--pericardium, myocardium, or endocardium (including valves). Hence, rheumatic fever is said to cause pancarditis. (Robbins Basic pathology,9th edition.pg no.391)",B
Mechanism of action thiazide is -,Na+Cl- symport inhibitor,Na+K+ symport inhibitor,Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor,Osmotic diuresis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Na+ Cl- synport inhibitor o Na+ absorption at different tubular sites.PT - 65-70%Asc. LH - 20-25%DT - 8-9%CD- 1-2%o Tubular absorption can be divided into four sites.Site I- Proximal tubuleo Four mechanisms of Na4 transport have been defined in this segment -1. Direct entry of Na4 along electrochemical gradient.2. Na+-K+ symport along with active reabsorption of glucose, aminoacids, organic anions and PO4 -33. Exchange with H+ by Na+ /H+ exchanger located in the luminal membrane of proximal tubule (PT) epithelial cells. The PT cells secrete H+ with the help of carbonic anhvdrase. H+ ion exchanges with Na+ present in tubular fluid through Na+-H+ exchanger (antiporter) and forms H2CO3 by combining with HCO3-. This H2CO3 is broken into H2O + CO2 by brush border carbonic anhydrase; both CO2 and H2O diffuse inside the cell and recombine to form H2CO3 with the help of intracellular carbonic anhydrase. This H2CO3 is the source of H+. The dissociated HCO3- in the cell is transported to cortical E.C.F. by basolateral membrane Na+-HCO3- symporter resulting in net reabsorption of NaHCO3.Carbonic anvdrase inhibitors (acetazoiamide) act predominantly in PCTand inhibit NaHCQ3 reabsorption.4. The disroportionately large HCO3-, acetate, PO4-3, passive driving forces for Cl- to diffuse through the paracellular pathway, particularly in the later PT. This takes Na+ and H2O along to maintain electrical neutrality and isotonicity; reabsorption in PT is isotonic.o Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) are solutes which are not absorbed in proximal tubule and therefore retain water:Site 11 Ascending limb of loop of Henleo The thick ascending limb can be distinguished into two distinct portion.Medullary portion lined by cuboidal cells.Cortical portion lined by flattened cells.o Both portions are relatively impermeable to water but absorb salt actively and thus dilute tubular fluid,o In the medullary portion a distinct luminal membrane carrier transports ions in ratio of Na+-K+-2Cl-. The sodium enters the cell is pumped to ECF by Na+ K+ ATPase at the basolateral membrane,o This Na+ -K+--2Cl= symport is inhibited by loop diuretics (eg-Furosemide)o In addition, a Na+-Cl- symporter moves Cl- down its electrochemical gradient into ECF and carries Na+ along.Site III - cortical diluting segment of loop of Henle and early DTo This segment is also impermeable to H2O and continues to absorb salt through Na+-Cl- symporter.o Thiazide diuretics act at this site.Site IV - late distal tubule and collecting ducto In late DT and CD, Na+ is actively reabsorbed; the cation-anion balance being maintained partly by passive Cl- diffusion and partly by secretion of K+ and H+.o Absorption of Na+ at this site occurs through a specific amiloride sensitive Na+ channel and is controlled to a large extent by aldosterone.o K+- sparing diuretics act at this site.o Collecting tubule is the most important site of K+ secretion by the kidney and the site at which virtually all diuretic induced changes in K+ balance occur - as K+ secretion occurs in exchange of Na+, higher the Na+ load in CD higher will be K+ excretion in urine - Diuretics which act on PCT (maximum absortion of Na+ occurs at PCT) like acetazolamide will cause maximum kaliuresis (K+ excretion in urine),o The principal cells are the major sites of Na+, K+, and water transport, and intercalated cells are the primary sites of H+ secretion.o The collecting tubule is also the site at which the final urine concentration is determined. ADH (vasopressin) controls the permeability of this segment to water by regulating the insertion of preformed wrater channels (aquaporin-2, AQP2) into the apical membrane via a G protein - coupled cAMP - mediated process.o ADH also stimulates the insertion of urea transporter UT1 molecules into the apical membranes of medullary collecting tubule cells. Urea concentration in the medulla plays an important role maintaining the high osmolarity of the medulla and in the concentration of urine.",A

What laboratory method or test can be used to detect the presence of hemoglobin S?,Coombs' test,Osmotic fragility test,Metabisulfite test,Sucrose hemolysis test,"The metabisulfite test is used to detect the presence of hemoglobin S, but it does not differentiate the heterozygous sickle cell trait from the homozygous sickle cell disease. The test is based on the fact that erythrocytes with a large propoion of hemoglobin S sickle in solutions of low oxygen content. Metabisulfite is a reducing substance that enhances the process of deoxygenation. The osmotic fragility test is a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytes lyse at a higher concentration of salt than do normal cells, thus causing an increased osmotic fragility. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT), or Coombs' test, is used to differentiate autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) due to the presence of anti-red cell antibodies from other forms of hemolytic anemia. In this test, antibodies to human immunoglobulin cause the agglutination (clotting) of red cells if these anti-red cell antibodies are present on the surface of the red cells. In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, the erythrocytes are excessively sensitive to complement-mediated lysis in low ionic environments (the basis for the sucrose hemolysis test) or in acidotic conditions, such as sleep, exercise, or the Ham's acid hemolysis test. The Schilling test, which measures intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 with and without intrinsic factor, is used to diagnose decreased vitamin B12 caused by pernicious anemia, which is characterized by a lack of intrinsic factor.

One of the following disorders is due to maternal disomy of chromosome 15 -,Prader Willi syndrome,Angelman syndrome,Hydatidiform mole,Klinefelter's syndrome,"Ans. is `b' i.e., Angleman syndrome o Don't get confused by previous explanations, where I have explained the deletion of paternal chromosome 15 in Prader Willi Syndrome. o To understand this question, one should know genomic imprinting as well as uniparental disomy. Genomic imprinting o A person inherits two copies of their genes one_ form their mother and one from their father Usually both copies of each gene are active or 'turned on' in cells.. o In some cases however only one of the two copies is turned on. o Which copy is active depends on the parent of origin. Some genes are normally active only when they are inherited from a person's father. Others are active only when inherited from a person's mother. o This phenomenon is known as genomic imprinting. In genes that undergo genomic imprinting, the parent of origin is often marked or 'stamped' on the gene during the formation of egg and sperm cells. This stamping process called methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to ceain segments of DNA. These molecules identify which copy of a gene was inherited from the mother and which was inherited from father. The gene that are imprinted or stamped are 'silent'i.e.,they do not remain functional. Uniparental disomy (UDP) o Normally a person inherits one copy of each chromosome pair from biological mother and the other copy of the chromosome pair from biological father. Uniparental disomy occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome from the same parent and no copies from the other parent. o UDP can occur as random event during the formation of egg or sperm cells or may happen in early fetal development. Example of Genomic imprinting and UDP The classical examples are Prader -Willi syndrome and Angleman syndrome. Prader-Willi syndrome o Approximately 70% of affected individuals have a small deletion on long arm ofparenteral chromosome 15,i.e. paternal genomic imprinting. There is silencing of paternal gene due to deletion.. Paternal gene Silenced (Paternal genomic imprinting) Maternal gene Only functional alle present o The remaining 30% of patients have maternal uniparenteral disomy for chromosome 15. That is they have two otherwise normal copies of maternal chromosome 15 and no paternal 15. o Thus Prader Willi syndrome ( in both above situations) results from the absence of paternal contribution to this region of chrmosome 15, whether by paternal deletion ( paternal genomic imprinting) or maternal UPD. Angleman syndrome o Most of the affected individuals have deletion on maternal chrmosome 15,i.e. maternal genomic imprinting. There is silencing of maternal gene due to deletion. Maternal gene Silenced (Maternal genomic imprinting) Paternal gene Only functional allel present o The remaining patients have paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15, i.e., they have two otherwise normal copies of paternal chromosome 15 and no maternal 15. o Thus Angleman syndrome results from the absence of maternal contribution to this region of chromossome 15, whether by maternal deletion ( maternal genomicimprinting) or paternal UDP.

Rosenthal fibres in astrocytoma is composed of,Heat shock proteins,Fibrillar proteins,GFAP,Globulins,"Well-differentiated astrocytomas are poorly defined, gray, infiltrative tumors that expand and disto the invaded brain without forming a discrete mass (Fig. 22-28, A). Infiltration beyond the grossly evident margins is always present. The cut surface of the tumor is either firm or soft and gelatinous; cystic degeneration may be seen. In glioblastoma, variation in the gross appearance of the tumor from region to region is characteristic (Fig. 22-28, B). Some areas are firm and white, others are soft and yellow (the result of tissue necrosis), and still others show regions of cystic degeneration and hemorrhage. Well-differentiated astrocytomas are characterized by a mild to moderate increase in the number of glial cell nuclei, somewhat variable nuclear pleomorphism, and an intervening feltwork of fine, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytic cell processes that give the background a fibrillary appearance. The transition between neoplastic and normal tissue is indistinct, and tumor cells can be seen infiltrating normal tissue many centimeters from the main lesion. Ana- plastic astrocytomas show regions that are more densely cellular and have greater nuclear pleomorphism; mitotic figures are present.

On fuher testing, which of the following is least likely to be found in this patient?",HBeAg,Anti-HBs antibodies,HBV DNA,HBV DNA polymerase,"HBsAg appears before the onset of symptoms and peaks in acute, symptomatic disease. HBsAg persists in cases of chronic hepatitis B. Anti-HBs antibody begins to rise following the resolution of acute disease, generally after the disappearance of HBsAg. Anti-HBs antibodies tend to persist for life, conferring protection; this is the basis for current vaccination strategies using noninfectious HBsAg. By contrast, anti-HBs antibodies are not produced in cases that progress to chronic liver disease. HBeAg, HBV DNA, and HBV DNA polymerase are detectable in the serum soon after HBsAg and signify active viral replication Persistence of HBeAg is an impoant indicator of continued virus replication, infectivity, and probable progression to chronic hepatitis. Anti-HBe antibody signifies that acute infection has peaked and is on the wane, whereas in cases that progress to chronic infection, anti-HBe antibody is not produced or appears only late in the disease course.",B

Postmoem histologic sections taken from the liver of a 19-year-old female who died from an overdose of acetaminophen would most likely revea,Centrilobular necrosis,Focal scattered necrosis,Midzonal necrosis,Peripoal necrosis,"The type and distribution of necrotic hepatocytes is often a clue as to the cause of the hepatic injury. Focal scattered necrosis is characteristic of viral hepatitis, but may also be seen with bacterial infections or other toxic insults. In focal necrosis, there is necrosis of single hepatocytes, or small clusters of hepatocytes, that is randomly located in some, but not all, of the liver lobules. In contrast, zonal necrosis refers to the finding of hepatocellular necrosis in identical areas in all of the liver lobules. There are basically three types of zonal necrosis. Centrilobular (acinar zone 3) necrosis is characteristic of ischemic injury (hea failure or shock), toxic effects (acetaminophen toxicity), carbon tetrachloride exposure, or chloroform ingestion. Drugs such as acetaminophen may be metabolized in zone 1 to toxic compounds that cause necrosis of zone 3 hepatocytes because they receive the blood from zone 1. Midzonal (zone 2) necrosis is quite rare, but may be seen in yellow fever, while peripoal (zone 1) necrosis is seen in phosphorus poisoning or eclampsia. Submassive necrosis refers to liver cell necrosis that crosses the normal lobular boundaries. Classically the necrosis goes from poal areas to central veins (or vice versa) and is called bridging necrosis. If the hepatocellular necrosis is severe, it is called massive necrosis. This type of extensive necrosis is described as acute yellow atrophy, as grossly the liver appears soft, yellow, flabby, and decreased in size with a wrinkled capsule. It may be produced by hepatitis viruses (usually B or C), drugs, or chemicals. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",A

Which of the following cells are involved in the process of 'efferocytosis'?,Macrophages,T lymphocytes,B lymphocytes,NK cells,"Cells that are dying by apoptosis also secrete soluble factors that recruit phagocytes, and macrophages themselves may produce proteins that bind to apoptotic cells (but not live cells), leading to their engulfment. Apoptotic bodies may also become coated with natural antibodies and proteins of the complement system, notably C1q, which are recognized by phagocytes. Thus, numerous ligands induced on apoptotic cells serve as 'eat me' signals and are recognized by receptors on phagocytes that bind and engulf these cells. This process of apoptotic cell phagocytosis is called efferocytosis; it is so efficient that dead cells disappear, often within minutes, without leaving a trace.",A

The ability of stem cells to cross the barrier of differentiation to transform into a cell of another lineage expressing the molecular characteristics of different cell type with the ability to perform the function of the new cell type is referred as:,De differentiation,Re differentiation,Trans differentiation,Sub differentiation,"Transdifferentiation is defined as:-

The change of a cell or tissue from one differentiated state to another.
The differentiation of a tissue-specific stem cell into another type of cell as for example a bone marrow stem cell differentiating into a neuron.

Dedifferentiation

It is a cellular process commonly believed to be uniquely available to lower life forms such as worms and amphibians in which a partially or terminally differentiated cell reverts to an earlier developmental stage.
Cells in cell culture can lose properties they originally had such as protein expression or change shape. This process is also termed dedifferentiation.
Dedifferentiation can also be observed in some tumour e.g. dedifferentiated liposarcomas which will show more immature areas in an otherwise differentiated liposarcoma.
Regression of a specialized cell or tissue to a simpler, more embryonic, unspecialized form i.e. a reversal of cell development so that differentiation that had occurred previously is lost and the cells become more generalized in structure.

This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The functional activity of NK cells is regulated by a balance between signals from activating and inhibitory receptors NK cell inhibitory receptors recognize self-class I MHC molecules, which are expressed on all healthy cells. The inhibitory receptors prevent NK cells from killing normal cells.

Methanol toxicity causes blindness due to the formation of: March 2010,Formic acid,Formaldehyde,Lactic acid,Pyruvic acid,"Ans. A: Formic Acid The initial step in the metabolism of methanol involves the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). First, methanol is slowly oxidized by ADH to yield formaldehyde. Next, formaldehyde is oxidized by formaldehyde dehydrogenase to yield formic acid (or formate, depending on the pH). This oxidation occurs rapidly so that little formaldehyde accumulates in the serum. Finally, formic acid is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, which are excreted by the kidneys and lungs. The accumulation of formic acid is responsible for the presence of metabolic acidosis. Formic acid also inhibits cellular respiration leading to lactic acidosis. The ocular injury caused by methanol may be due to retinal injury, which results from intra-retinal metabolism of methanol and the accumulation of formic acid. Alternatively, it may be caused be the inhibition of normal metabolism in optic nerve calls.",A

Pale infarcts are seen at all of the following sites except-,Hea,Spleen,Kidney,Lung,"Ans is 'd' i.e., Lung INFARCTION o An infarct is an area of ischemic necrosis by occlusion of either the aerial supply or venous drainage in a paicular tissue. Pathogenesis o Mostly it is caused by interrupted blood supply. o 'Nearly 99% of all infarcts results from thrombotic or embolic events and almost all result. from aerial occlusion'. o Other causes of interrupted aerial supply are local vasospasm, extrinsic compression of a vessel by tumor, twisting of vessel e.g., in testicular torsion, expansion of atheroma due to hemorrhage within the plaque. o Venous obstruction usually cause congesion, edema, infarction does not occur because bypass channels rapidly open after the thrombus, providing some outflow from the area, which inturn improves aerial inflow. Infarct cause by venous thrombosis is more likely in organs with a single venous outflow channel, such as in testis and ovary. Types of infarct o Infarcts are classified on the basis of their color. o Infarcts are classified into either Red (Haemorrhagic) or White or Pale (anaemic) infarcts, reflecting the amount of haemorrhage. Red infarcts (Haemorrhagic) : occur with : Venous occlusions (eg ovarian torsion); In loose tissues (such as lungs); In tissues with dual circulation (e.g. Lung & S. intestine) In tissues that were previously congested because of sluggish venous out flow. When flow is reestablilshed to a site of previous aerial occulusion and necrosis.

"Serum marker indicating active viral replication in hepatitis-B is: September 2006, March 2013",HBsAg,HBeAg,HBcAg,HBV DNA,"Ans. B: HBeAg, D: HBV DNA The first detectable viral marker for hepatitis-B is HBeAg, followed by hepatitis B, e-antigen (HBeAg) and HBV DNA. Titers may be high during the incubation period, but HBV DNA and HBeAg levels begin to fall at the onset of illness and may be undetectable at the time of peak clinical illness. Core-antigen does not appear in blood, but antibody to this antigen (anti-HBc) is detectable with the onset of clinical symptoms. The immunoglobulin M (IgM) fraction is used in an impoant diagnostic assay for acute hepatitis B, infection. Before current molecular assays were available, it was the only marker detectable in the window period, the time between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs. Patients who clear the virus lose HBsAg and develop anti-HBsAb, a long-lasting antibody associated with immunity. The presence of anti-HBsAb and anti-HBcAb (IgG) indicates recovery and immunity in a previously infected individual, whereas a successful vaccination response produces antibody only to HBsAg. HBeAg is another viral marker detectable in blood and correlates with active viral replication and therefore high viral load and infectivity. The-antigen is synthesized from a strand of DNA immediately preceding the area that codes for the core-antigen.",B

Tone of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is increased and gastroesophageal reflux opposed.o It has less prominent effect on lower GIT - increases intestinal motility to some extent, but has no significant action on colonic motility,o Metoclopramide is an effective antiemetic.o Mechanism of action.1. 5-HT4 agonism - stimulation of 5-HT4 receptor in GIT enhances the release of ACH from myenteric plexus - Main prokinetic action of metoclopropamide is due to this action.2. D2 antagonism - Blockade of D2 receptor in CTZ is mainly responsible for antiemetic effect. D2 receptor blockade in GIT is responsible for some prokinetic action also.3. 5-HT3 antagonism - At higher concentration.o Uses - As an antiemetic, as a gastrokinetic in GERD, in dyspepsia.o Adverse effects - Sedation, dizziness, loose stools, muscle dystonia (especially in children) are the main side effects. D2 - blocking action may cause extrapyramidal symptoms (Akathsia, Parkinsonism) and hyperprolactinemia (galactorrhea, gynacomastia).",B

Which among the following is an example for programmed cell death?,Councilman Bodies,Gamma Gandy Body,Russell bodies,None.,"During apoptosis, buds or projections are formed on the cell surface. These buds contain shrunken cell organelles. These surface buds detach loose, the entire cell thus is fragmented and released as loose paicles known as the apoptotic bodies. A whole shrunk, shrivelled up and eosinophilic cell is also known as a mummified cell. The best example for this process is seen in the liver in all conditions of hepatitis. The apoptotic cell lies free in the sinusoid. These bodies are known as Councilman Bodies. Gamna-Gandy bodies represent organized foci of hemorrhage within the spleen, usually caused by poal hypeension and rarely observed in children. Russell Bodies are smooth rounded bodies which occur in the cytoplasm of plasma cells, paicularly in chronically inflamed tissues and in the plasma cell neoplasms, multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma.

An ultrasound examination reveals the presence of fluid in the abdominal cavity and the right thoracic cavity. Which of the following conditions is most strongly suggested by this patient's presentation?",Ectopic pregnancy,Endometrial implant,Ovarian fibroma,Pelvic inflammatory disease,"Meigs syndrome is the unusual combination of hydrothorax (often right sided), ascites, and an ovarian tumor (often a benign fibroma). Low back pain and a stretching or pulling sensation are characteristic of ascites in some patients (ascites can also be asymptomatic). The etiology of the fluid accumulation in Meigs syndrome remains a mystery. Ectopic pregnancy would not be associated with hydrothorax. If an ectopic pregnancy ruptured, blood could accumulate in the abdominal cavity, but the patient would likely be hypotensive or dead. An endometrial implant could cause pain, or impair feility, but would not be expected to produce the combination of ascites and isolated right-sided hydrothorax. Pelvic inflammatory disease would be unlikely to produce the combination of ascites and isolated right-sided hydrothorax, although it might cause low back pain or pelvic pain.

Dent's disease often produces the following signs and symptoms: Rickets Extreme thirst combined with dehydration Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) Hypercalciuria (high urine calcium - >300 mg/d or >4 mg/kg per d) with normal levels blood/serum calcium) Aminoaciduria (amino acids in urine) Phosphaturia (phosphate in urine) Diagnosis is based on a genetic study of CNCL5 gene Ref: wikipedia",C
Drug of choice for chlamydial infection in pregnancy is:,Doxycycline,Tetracycline,Erythromycin,Ciprofloxacin,"ERYTHROMYCIN It was isolated from Streptomyces erythreus in 1952. Since then it has been widely employed, mainly as alternative to penicillin. Water solubility of erythromycin is limited, and the solution remains stable only when kept in cold. Uses A . As an alternative to penicillin 1 . Streptococcal pharyngitis, tonsillitis, mastoiditis and community acquired respiratory infections caused by pneumococci and H. influenzae respond equally well to erythromycin. It is an alternative drug for prophylaxis of rheumatic fever and SABE. However, many bacteria resistant to penicillin are also resistant to erythromycin. 2. Diphtheria: acute stage as well as for carriers-7 day treatment. Some prefer it over penicillin. Antitoxin is the primary treatment. 3. Tetanus: as an adjuvant to antitoxin, toxoid therapy. 4. Syphilis and gonorrhoea: only if other alternative drugs, including tetracyclines also cannot be used: relapse rates are higher. 5. Leptospirosis: 250 mg 6 hourly for 7 days in patients allergic to penicillins. B. As a first choice drug for 1 . Atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae: rate of recovery is hastened. 2. Whooping cough: a 1-2 week course of erythromycin is the most effective treatment for eradicating B. peussis from upper respiratory tract. However, effect on the symptoms depends on the stage of disease when treatment is staed. (a) Prophylactic: during the 10 day incubation period-disease is prevented. (b) Catarrhal stage: which lasts for about a week-erythromycin may abo the next stage or reduce its duration and severity. (c) Paroxysmal stage: lasting 2-4 weeks-no effect on the duration and severity of &;croup&; despite eradication of the causative organism. (d) Convalescent stage: during which &;croup&; gradually resolves (4-12 weeks)-is not modified. Azithromycin, clarithromycin, and chloramphenicol are the alternative antimicrobials. Cough sedatives are not very effective. Coicosteroids may reduce the duration of paroxysmal stage but increase the risk of superinfections and carrier stage; should be reserved for severe cases only.

Which of the following drugs is both antiresoptiveand bone formative?,Strontium ranelate,Calcitonin,Ibadronate,Teriperatide,"Strontium Ranelate Osteoporosis is an abnormal decrease in amount orbone, but whatever left, is of normal quality. It results from bone loss due to age related changes in bone remodelling. In adult bones, remodelling is the principal metabolic skeletal process. - During remodelling the bone is ,first resorbed by osteoclasts and is then replaced by an equal amount of bone tissue due to action of osteoblasts. - This process of bone resorption and formation goes on throughout the adult life, and it serves two purposes. - To repair the microdamage within the skeleton. - To supply calcium. from the skeleton to maintain serum calcium. In young adult the resorbed bone is replaced by an equal amount of new bone tissue. Thus the mass of skeleton remains constant after peak bone mass in achieved in adulthood. However after the age of 35-40 the resorption and formation processes becomes imbalanced and resorption exceeds formation. - Excessive bone loss can be due to an increase in osteoclastic activity and or decrease in osteoblastic activity. Mechanism of action of Strontium Ranelate in the tit of osteoporosis. Strontium Ranelate increases bone mass throughout the skeleton. It appears to be modestly antiresorptive while at the same time not causing much decrease in bone fonnation. - Strontium is incorporated into hydroxyappatite replacing calcium, a feature that might explain some of its .fracture benefit. It is approved in several European countries for the t/ t of osteoporosis. Pharmacological agents used to manage osteoporosis either act by - Decreasing the rate of bone resorption (antiresorptive therapy.) - Promoting bone formation (anabolic therapy). Since bone remodelling is a coupled process, antiresorptive drugs ultimately decrease the rate of bone .formation and therefore do not promote substantial gains in BMD. 'Thus, Strontium renelate is unique because it decreases osteoclastosis as well as promote bone formation.' More on tit of osteoporosis Pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis is generally aimed at restoring bone strength and preventing .fractures. The long standing centrepiece of this approach has been antiresorptive drugs such as: ? - Biphosphonate - Estrogen - Selective estrogen receptor modulator, Raloxifene - Calcitonin Until recently, antiresorptive drugs were the only drugs approved in the United States ,for treating osteoporosis. This situation changed in 2002 when FDA approved Teriparatide (the biologically active PTH fragment). Teriparatide acts by increasing the bone mass - Because teriparatide stimulates bone formation whereas biphosphonates reduce bone resorption, it was predicted that therapy combining the two would enhance the effect on bone marrow density more than treatment with either one alone. - However addition of teriparatide to alendronate provided no additional bebefit for bone mass density. Before the advent of strontium Ranelate there was'nt any drug which combined the two processes i.e., increasing bone formation and at the same time, decreasing bone resorption. Strontium Ranelate has a novel mechanism of action for an osteoporotic drug as it acts on bone resorption to reduce the rate of hone growth but also acts on bone formation promoting the growth of new bone. More on antiresorptive therapies for osteoporosis: Biphosphonates Alendronate,Pamidronctte Most effective drugs currently approved for prevention and t/t of osteoporosis. They suppress bone resorption at doses that do not inhibit mineralization. Thiazide diuretics They are not strictly antiresorptive but they reduce urinary Cat` excretion and constrain bone loss in patients with hypercalciurea. Estrogen There is an unambiguous relationship between estrogen deficiency and osteoporosis. Post menopausal status or estrogen deficiency at any stage significantly increases patient's risk.for osteoporosis. Selective Estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) These are estrogenic compounds with tissue selective activities. Raloxifene (SERM) acts as an estrogen agonist on bone and liver and is inactive on the uterus. Calcitonin Calcitonin inhibits oteoclastic bone resorption.",A

Raised serum level of lipoprotein-a is a predictor of -,Cirrhosis of liver,Rheumatic ahritis,Atherosclerosis,Cervical cancer,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Atherosclerosis Lipoprotein - (a) o Lp (a) is a lipoprotein similar to LDL in lipid and protein composition, but it contains an additional protein called apolipoprotein (a). o Elevated level of Lp (a) is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis. o How does Lp (a) increase the risk of atherosclerosis ? In atherosclerosis, there is hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis due to associated inflammation (remind you-atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition). So there is consistent doposition of fibrin. Lp (a) has close homology to plasminogen and it competes with plosminogen for binding on the surface of endothelium. This result in reduced generation of plasmin from plasminogen --> Inhibition of endogenous fibrinolytic system. This enhances fuher fibrin deposition. In addition, Lp (a) is accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions. So, Lp (a) causes impaired cell surface fibrinolysis and progressive atherosclerosis.",C
Snail track ulcer and cobblestone appearance are seen together in:,Secondary syphilis,Heck's disease,Tertiary syphilis,Pyostomatitis vegetans,"In secondary syphilis, only snail track ulcers are seen.
Hyperplastic lesions in Heck's disease are small (0.3–1.0 cm), discrete, and well-demarcated, but they frequently cluster so closely together that the entire mucosal area takes on a cobblestone or fissured appearance.
Patients with pyostomatitis vegetans exhibit characteristic yellowish, slightly elevated, linear, serpentine pustules set on an erythematous oral mucosa. The lesions primarily affect the buccal and labial mucosa, soft palate, and ventral tongue. These lesions have been called “snail track” ulcerations, although in most instances, the lesions are probably not truly ulcerated. 
The most frequently affected area was the buccal mucosa which presented a ‘cobblestone’ appearance, while the vestibular lesions appeared as folds and ulcers.

Long-acting preparations of nitroglycerin may be completely degraded by the liver in some patients and thus are generally less effective than sublingual forms. Because individual variability in metabolism is considerable, doses should be titrated against side effects and should not conform to a rigidly standardized regimen. Tolerance is common and must be considered if a patient fails to respond to a previously efficacious dose.

Due to this reason, sodium bicarbonate increases the rapidity of onset of action (LA are weak bases and in an alkaline medium easily cross the membrane).
Un-myelinated and weakly myelinated fibres are blocked first and then the myelinated ones.
These do not affect the resting membrane potential rather inhibit the depolarization.
Resting nerves are less sensitive to block by LA than the stimulated nerves.",B

"A 67-year-old man has had increasing weakness, fatigue, and weight loss over the past 5 months. He now has decreasing vision in both eyes and has headaches and dizziness. His hands are sensitive to cold. On physical examination, he has generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory studies indicate a serum protein level of 15.5 g/dL and albumin concentration of 3.2 g/dL. A bone marrow biopsy is performed, and microscopic examination of the specimen shows infiltration by numerous small plasmacytoid lymphoid cells with Russell bodies in the cytoplasm. Which of the following additional laboratory findings is most likely to be reported for this patient?",Bence Jones proteinuria,Hypercalcemia,Karyotype with t (14;18) translocation,Monoclonal IgM spike in serum,"Hyperviscosity syndrome includes visual disturbances, dizziness, headache, and Raynaud phenomena. His bone marrow is infiltrated with plasmacytoid lymphocytes that have stored immunoglobulins in their cytoplasm (Russell bodies). All of these findings are consistent with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia). In this disorder, neoplastic B cells differentiate to IgM-producing cells; there is a monoclonal IgM spike in the serum. These IgM molecules aggregate and produce hyperviscosity, and some of them agglutinate at low temperatures and produce cold agglutinin disease. Myeloma, which is typically accompanied by a monoclonal gammopathy, most often does not cause liver and spleen enlargement, and morphologically, the cells resemble plasma cells. Light chains in urine (Bence Jones proteins) also are a feature of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia occurs with myeloma because myeloma cells produce MIP1-a that up-regulates RANKL production and increased osteoclastic activity, so punched-out lytic bone lesions are typical of multiple myeloma. A t (14;18) translocation is characteristic of a follicular lymphoma. There is typically no leukemic phase to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.",D
The antianginal effect of b-blockers may be attributed to which one of the following,Increased hea rate,Increase in diastolic perfusion time,Decreased end diastolic ventricular volume,Increase in ejection time,"The beneficial effects of b-blocking agents are related to their hemodynamic effects--decreased hea rate, blood pressure, and contractility--which decrease myocardial oxygen requirements at rest and during exercise. Lower hea rate is also associated with an increase in diastolic perfusion time that may increase coronary perfusion. Undesirable effects of b-blocking agents in angina include an increase in end-diastolic volume and an increase in ejection time, both of which tend to increase myocardial oxygen requirement.

Which among the following is a function of prolactin during lactation?,Increased FSH,Increased libido,Increased testosterone,Decreased estrogen,"Prolactin (PRL) acts to induce and maintain lactation, decrease reproductive function, and suppress sexual drive. PRL inhibits reproductive function by suppressing hypothalamic GnRH and pituitary gonadotropin secretion and by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both women and men. In the ovary, PRL blocks folliculogenesis and inhibits granulosa cell aromatase activity, leading to hypoestrogenism and anovulation. PRL also has a luteolytic effect, generating a shoened, or inadequate, luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In men, attenuated LH secretion leads to low testosterone levels and decreased spermatogenesis. These hormonal changes decrease libido and reduce feility in patients with hyperprolactinemia.

Type 1 Lepra Reaction is Type IV Hypersensitivity Reaction ic Cell Mediated Immunity (1 +4 = 5)
Type II Lepra Reaction is Type III Hypersensitivity Reaction ie Immune Complexes (2 + 3 = 5)
Type I Lepra Reactions (Downgrading and Reversal Reactions)

Patients with borderline forms of leprosy hut not in patients with pure lepromatous disease.
It is Gell and Coombs type IV hypersensitivity reaction
Manifestations include classic signs of inflammation within previously involved macules, papules, and plaques and. on occasion, the appearance of new skin lesions, neuritis, and (less commonly j fever-—generally low-grade.
The nerve trunk most commonly involved in this process is the ulnar nerve at the elbow, which may be painful and exquisitely tender.
The most dramatic manifestation is foot dr op, which occurs when the peroneal nerve is involved.
When type 1 lepra reactions precede the initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, they are termed downgrading reactions. and the case becomes histologically more lepromatous: when they occur after the initiation of therapy, they are termed reversal reactions, and the case becomes more tuberculoid.
Reversal reactions often occur in the first months or years after the initiation of therapy but may also develop several years thereafter.
Edema is the most characteristic microscopic feature of type 1 lepra lesions, whose diagnosis is primarily clinical.

Type 2 lepra reaction (Erythema nodosum leprosum )

It is an immune complex mediated hypersensitivity reaction
It is Gell and Coombs type III hypersensitivity reaction

"A 40-year-old woman has experienced chest pain on exertion for the past 2 months. A month ago, she had pneumonia with Streptococcus pneumoniae cultured from her sputum. On physical examination, she has a body mass index of 35. A random blood glucose value is 132 mg/dL. The next day, fasting blood glucose is 120 mg/dL, followed by a value of 122 mg/ dL on the following day. She is given an oral glucose tolerance test, and her blood glucose is 240 mg/dL 2 hours after receiving the standard 75-g glucose dose. On the basis of these findings, she is prescribed an oral thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug. After 2 months of therapy, her fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/ dL. The beneficial effect of TZD in this patient is most likely related to which of the following processes?",Activation of PPARg nuclear receptor in adipocytes,Decreased production of insulin autoantibodies,Greater density of insulin receptors in adipocytes,Increased half-life of circulating plasma insulin,"The clinical features of obesity with angina and glucose intolerance in this patient strongly suggest type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is confirmed by the oral glucose tolerance test (>200 mg/dL at 2 hours), useful in this case because her fasting blood glucose levels of 120 mg/dL and 122 mg/dL did not quite reach the diagnostic criterion of 126 mg/dL. The fundamental abnormality in type 2 diabetes mellitus is insulin resistance. Several adipocyte-derived molecules, such as adiponectin and resistin, have been implicated in the causation of insulin resistance, establishing the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg) has emerged as a key molecule in the regulation of insulin resistance through its actions on adipocyte hormones. TZDs bind to and activate PPARg in adipocytes, and increase the levels of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin and reduce the levels of free fatty acids and resistin, both of which increase insulin resistance. Insulin autoantibodies are seen with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Beta-cell loss and density of insulin receptors are not major factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. TZDs do not affect the metabolism of insulin. Glucagon excess worsens diabetes, but TZDs do not affect its secretion. Beta cells do not regenerate, but many antidiabetogenic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus are designed to work with the beta cells that are left.",A

Most friable vegetation is seen in,Infective endocarditis,Libman sacks endocarditis,Non bacterial thrombotic endocarditis,Rheumatic hea disease,"Vegetations on hea valves are the classic hallmark of IE; these are friable, bulky, potentially destructive lesions containing fibrin, inflammatory cells, and bacteria or other organisms (Figs. 12-24 and 12-25). The aoic and mitral valves are the mostsites of infection, although the valves of the right hea may also be involved, paicularly in intravenous drug abusers. Vegetations can be single or multiple and may involve more than one valve; they can occasionally erode into the underlying myocardium and produce an abscess (ring abscess; Fig. 12-25B). Vegetations are prone to embolization; because the embolic fragments often contain virulent organisms, abscesses frequently develop where they lodge, leading to sequelae such as septic infarcts or mycotic aneurysms. The vegetations of subacute endocarditis are associated with less valvular destruction than those of acute endocarditis, although the distinction can be subtle. Microscopically, the vegetations of subacute IE typically exhibit granulation tissue at their bases indicative of healing. With time, fibrosis, calcification, and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate can develop.",A

The histopathological examination is most likely to show:,Myxomatous degeneration and prolapse of the mitral valve,Fibrinous deposition on the tip of papillary muscle,Rupture of chordae tendinae,Aschoff nodule on the mitral valve,"Ans. a. Myxomatous degeneration and prolapse of the mitral valve (Ref: Robbins 9/e p556)The clinical picture mentioned in the question is suggestive of Mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP). The histopathological examination in MVP is most likely to show myxomatous degeneration and prolapse of the mitral valve.Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome (MVP)MVP is also termed as systolic click murmur syndrome. Barlow's syndrome, Floppy-valve syndrome, and bellowing mitral leaflet syndromeIn MVP, one or both mitral valve leaflets are 'floppy' and prolapse, or balloon back, into the left atrium during systole.Common in young womenInheritance in familial cases is autosomal dominantQ.Morphology:Characteristic anatomic change in MVP: Interchordal ballooning (hooding) of the mitral leaflets or portions thereof.Affected leaflets are often enlarged, redundant, thick and rubbery.The associated tendinous cords may be elongated, thinned, or even ruptured, and the annulus may be dilated.The tricuspid, aortic, or pulmonary valves may also be affected.Elongated, redundant or ruptured chordae tendinae (patients with ruptured chordae tendinae are usually symptomatic with significant regurgitation - MR)Dysfunction and Ischemia of papillary musclesProgressive dilatation and calcification of mitral valve annulusHistologically, there is attenuation of the collagenous fibrosa layer of the valve, on which the structural integrity of the leaflet depends, accompanied by marked thickening of the spongiosa layer with deposition of mucoid (myxomatous) material.Key histologic change in MVP: Myxomatous degeneration.Clinical Features:Most patients are asymptomaticDiscovered incidentally by detection of a mid-systolic click on physical examination.Associated with a systolic murmurMajority of patients with MVP have no untoward effectsClinical course is usually benignPatients may present with non-specific chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue and palpitationsQAuscultatory findings are characteristic and most importantCharacteristic mid systolicQ or late systolic non ejectionQ clicks which may be multipleQLate systolic ejection murmurQ (Often but not always)Accentuation of findings by Valsalva and standingQDiminished by squatting and isometric exercisesQComplications of MVP (seen in 3% of cases)Infective endocarditisQMitral insufficiencyQ, sometimes with chordal ruptureArrhythmiasQ, both ventricular and atrial.Transient ischemic attackSudden deathQStroke or other systemic infarcts, resulting from embolism of leaflet thrombi.Diagnosis:Diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiographyQ.ECG is normal in most casesQRHD is characterized principally by deforming fibrotic valvular disease, particularly mitral stenosis, of which RHD is virtually the only causeQ.Morphology:During acute RF, focal inflammatory lesions are found in various tissues.Distinctive lesions occur in the heart, called Aschoff bodies, which consist of foci of lymphocytes (primarily T cells), occasional plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cells (pathognomonic for RF).These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round to ovoid nuclei in which the chromatin is disposed in a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation 'caterpillar cells'), and may become multinucleatedQ.During acute RF, diffuse inflammation and Aschoff bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the heart, causing pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis (pancarditis)Q.Inflammation of the endocardium and the left-sided valves typically results in fibrinoid necrosis within the cusps or along the tendinous cords.Overlying these necrotic foci are small (1-2 mm) vegetations, called verrucae, along the lines of closureQ.Subendocardial lesions, perhaps exacerbated by regurgitant jets, may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques, usually in the left atriumQ.The cardinal anatomic changes of the mitral valve in chronic RHD are leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening, and thickening and fusion of the tendinous cordsQ.Fibrous bridging across the valvular commissures and calcification create 'fish mouth''' or 'buttonhole' stenosesQ.",A

All are autosomal dominant except -,Familial hypercholesterolemia,Hereditary spherocytosis,Acute intermittent parphyria,Phenylketonuria,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that results in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine.] Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorder. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Babies born to mothers who have poorly treated PKU may have hea problems, a small head, and low bih weight. Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder inherited from a person's parents. It is due to mutations in the PAH gene which results in low levels of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This results in the build up of dietary phenylalanine to potentially toxic levels. It is autosomal recessive meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated for the condition to develop. There are two main types, classic PKU and variant PKU, depending on if any enzyme function remains. Those with one copy of a mutated gene typically do not have symptoms",D

"A 30-year-old man consults a physician because he has been having increasing difficulty in swallowing both solids and liquids. Physical examination of the patient is noncontributory. Barium swallow studies show a mostly dilated esophagus with slow passage of barium into the stomach. The very distal pa of the esophagus appears narrowed into a 'bird's beak.' Esophageal manometry shows incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter in response to swallowing, high resting lower esophageal pressure, and absent esophageal peristalsis. This patient's condition is MOST likely due to which of the following?",Acid reflux,Cancerous destruction,Candida infection,Lack of ganglion cells,"Individuals who have achalasia have been found to have a deficiency of inhibitory ganglion cells within the esophageal wall. This lack causes an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, with the result that the lower esophageal sphincter tends to have a higher-than-normal muscle tone and relaxes only with difficulty.Acid reflux can cause esophageal irritation, ulceration, and also predisposes for Barrett's metaplasia with subsequent risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.Cancerous destruction would produce a mass, or area of stricture or ulceration.Candida infection of the esophagus resembles thrush of the mouth, and causes a usually superficial infection. Also Know:Achalasia is associated with a slightly increased risk of squamous carcinoma.An impoant complication of achalasia is aspiration of the contents of the dilated esophagus into the trachea, leading to recurrent attacks of aspiration pneumonia Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R.

Thus, the great preponderance of normal females are in reality mosaics and have two populations of cells, one with an inactivated maternal X and the other with an inactivated paternal X. Herein lies the explanation of why females have the same dosage of X-linked active genes as have males. The inactive X can be seen in the interphase nucleus as a darkly staining small mass in contact with the nuclear membrane known as the Barr body, or Ar chromatin'-Robbins 8th/164X-INACTIVATION Harrison 18th/515;17th/411In normal females one of the chromosomes undergoes X inactivationin somatic cells.The inactivation ofthe paternal or maternal X chromosome occurs randomly in each somatic cell and thereby serves as a mechanism of dosage compensation, ensuring that males and females have equal expression of most X-linked genes.Some genes on the X chromosome 'escape' the inactivating mechanism and are expressed from both X chromosomes.In disorders such as Klinefelter syndrome, some genes may be expressed from both X chromosomes, resulting in its phenotypic features.",A

Triad of hemochromatosis is,"Macronodular cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus & skin pigmentation","Macronodular cirrhosis, diabetes insipidus & skin pigmentation","Micronodular cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus & skin pigmentation",None.,"Haemochromatosis is an iron-storage disorder in which there is excessive accumulation of iron in parenchymal cells with eventual tissue damage and functional insufficiency of organs such as the liver, pancreas, hea and pituitary gland. The condition is characterised by a triad of features-- micronodular pigment cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and skin pigmentation. On the basis of the last two features, the disease has also come to be termed as 'bronze diabetes'.

Abnormal chromosomal number which is exact multiple of the 23 -,Euploidy,Aneuploidy,Mosaicism,Trisomy,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Euploidy Chromosomal disorders (cvtogenetic disorders) o Chromosomal mutation may cause ? 1.Abnormal number of chromosomes 2.Alteration in the structure of chromosomes. 1. Abnormal number of chromosomes o There are 23 pairs of chromosomes (46, XX in females and 46, XY in males). o An exact multiple of the 23 (haploid number) is called euploidy. o When the number of chromosomes are not an exact multiple of 23, it is referred as aneuploidy. eg - Trisomy or monosomy. Pathogenesis of aneuploidy o In aneuploidy error either in meiosis or in mitosis. (a) Error in meiosis o It is the most common cause of aneuploidy. o The usual causes are nondisjunction or anaphase lag. o In nondisjunction, chromosomal pair fails to separate in first meiotic division during gametogenesis, so one gamete has an extra chromosome (n+1) and the other has one less chromosome (n-1). Feilization of such gametes with normal gamete results in two types of zygotes - trisomy (2n+1) or monosomy (2n-1). o In anaphase lag, one chromosome lags behind and is left out of the cell nucleus. The result is one gamete with normal chromosomes (n) and other gamete with one less chromosome (n-1). Feilization in two types of zygote -4 normal (2n) or monosomy (2n-1). (b) Error in Mitosis o Error in mitosis in early development give rise to two or more different types of populations in the same individuals, a condition referred as mosaicism. o Mosaicism affecting the sex chromosome is common. o In the division of an feilized ovum, an error may lead to one of the daughter cell receiving three sex chromosomes, where as the other recieves only one, yielding, a 45, X/47, XXX mosaic. That means the same individual will have both types of cells cells having 45, X and cells having 47, XXX. Then what is the difference between Monosomy / trisomy and mosachism ? Trisomy/monosomy are due to defect in meiosis and before feilization, so that after feilization all cells have same number of chromosome either monosomy or trisomy. In mosaicism, defect is in mitosis and after feilization so that same individual has cells of two different population eg. 45, X and 47, XXX. 2. Abnormal structure of chromosome o Chromosomal structural changes usually result from chromosome breakage followed by loss or rearrangement. o Beside these chromosomal structural abnormalities some autosomal recessive genetic disorders are associated with such a high level of chromosomal instability that they are known as chromosomal breakage syndrome --> Ataxia - telangiectasis, bloom syndrome, and fanconi anemia. There is significantly increased risk of cancer in these syndromes.",A

KDT 5th/pg. 100, 105)The commonly used cholinesterase inhibitors fall into three chemical groups:# Simple alcohols bearing a quaternary ammonium group, e g., edrophonium;# Carbamic acid esters of alcohols bearing quaternary or tertiary ammonium groups (carbamates, eg, neostigmine); and# Organic derivatives of phosphoric acid (organophosphates, e.g., echothiophate).CHOLINESTERASE REACTIVATORS# Used to restore neuromuscular transmission in case of organophosphate antiChE poisoning.# Pralidoxime (2-P AM) has a quartemary nitrogen: attaches to the anionic site of the enzyme which remains unoccupied in the presence of organophosphate inhibitors. Its oxime end reacts with the phosphorus atom attached to the esteratic site: the oximephosphonate so formed diffuses away leaving the reactivated ChE.# It is ineffective as an antidote to carbamate antiChEs (physostigmine, neostigmine, carbaryl, propoxur) in which case the anionic site of the enzyme is not free to provide attachment to pralidoxime.# It is rather contraindicated in carbamate poisoning because not only it does not reactivate carbamylated enzyme, it has weak anti ChE activity of its own.# Pralidoxime (800 mg/20 mL infusion) is injected i.v. slowly in a dose of 1-2 g (children 20-40 mg/kg).# It causes more marked reactivation of skeletal muscle ChE than at autonomic sites and not at all in the CNS (does not penetrate).# Treatment should be started as early as possible (within 24 hours), before the phosphorylated enzyme has undergone 'aging' and become resistant to hydrolysis. Doses may be repeated according to need (max. 12 g in first 24 hrs, lower doses according to symptoms for 1-2 weeks). The use of oximes in organophosphate poisoning is secondary to that of atropine.# Other oximes are obidoxime (more potent than pralidoxime) and diacetylmonoxime (DAM). DAM lacks quartemary nitrogen and is lipophilic. It combines with free organophosphate molecule in body fluids, rather than with those bound to the ChE. Hence, it is less effective, but reactivates ChE in the brain as well.",B

Programmed cell death is known as-,Cytolysis,Apoptosis,Necrosis,Proptosis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Apoptosis o Programmed cell death is apoptosis. o But remember this impoant fact that not all apoptosis are programmed cell death (read text below) Apoptosis o Apoptosis is pathway of cell death that is induced by a tightly regulated intracellular program in which cell destined to die activate enzymes that degrade the cell's own nuclear DNA, and nuclear & cytoplasmic proteins. o Apoptosis generally involves single cells in contrast to necrosis that usually involve a group of cells. o Apoptosis may be of two types ? A. Physiological (most of the time) Programmed cell death. B. Pathological Unprogrammed cell death. A.Physiological apoptosis o Death by apoptosis is a normal phenomenon that serves to eliminate cells that are no longer needed. o It is impoant in the following physiologic situation :? The programmed destruction of cells during embryogenesis, including implantation, organogenesis, and metamorphosis. Hormone dependent involution in adult, e.g., endometrial cell breakdown during menstural cycle, ovarian follicular atresia in the menopause, the regression of lactating breast after weaning, and prostatic atrophy after castration. Cell deletion in proliferating cell population in order to maintain a constant number, e.g., intestinal crypt epithelium. Death of host cells that have served their useful purpose, such as neutrophils after an acute inflammatory response, and lymphocytes at the end of an immune response. Elimination of potentially harmful self-reactive lymphocytes in thymus. Cell death induced by cytotoxic T cells to eliminate virus infected and neoplastic cells. Same mechanism occurs in graft versus host disease. B.Pathological apoptosis o Apoptosis may also be pathological. o When cells are damaged beyond repair, especially when the damage affects the cell's DNA, the irreparably damaged cells are eliminated : ? Cell death produced by injuries stimuli --> Radiation and cytotoxic anticancer drugs damage DNA, and if repair mechanisms cannot cope with the injury, the cell kills itself by apoptosis. In these situations, elimination of the cell may be a better alternative than risking mutations and translocations in the damaged DNA which may result in malignant transformation. Cell injury in ceain viral diseases, e.g., in viral hepatitis. Pathologic atrophy in parenchymal after duct obstruction, such as occurs in pancreas, parotid gland. Cell death in tumors.",B

Metaplasia occurs in all of the following except:,Stem cells,Squamous cells,Columnar cells,Transitional cells,"Ref: Chapter 1. Cellular responses to stress and toxic insults; page: 11: Robbins and Cot ran Pathologic Basis of Disease: 8th editionExplanation:Metaplasia is the results of reprogramming of stem cells that are known to exist in normal tissues, or of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells present in the connective tissue.Metaplasia is a reversible adaptive change in which one differentiated epithelial cell type is replaced by another epithelial cell type of mature type.Example of columnar to Squamous Metaplasia: in chronic smokers, the normal ciliated columnar epithelial cells of trachea and bronchi are replaced by squamous cells.Example of Squamous to columnar Metaplasia: in Barrett esophagus, in which esophageal Squamous epithelium is replaced by intestinal like columnar cells under the influence of refluxed gastric acid.Transitional /uro-epithelium can also undergo Squamous Metaplasia by chronic irritation like in urinary bladder stones.Hence, Metaplasia is basically due to reprogramming of stem cells as adaptive mechanism.Metaplasia is basically classified into two types:- Epithelial Metaplasia- Mesenchymal Metaplasia.The epithelial cells can undergo Metaplasia due to chronic irritation, if they have stem cell reserve component.Mesenchymal Metaplasia is rare: example is Myositis Ossificans, where muscles will undergo chondroid Metaplasia due to improper fracture healing.",A
Oral vancomycin is indicated in the following condition,Bacillary dysentery,Campylobacter diarrhoea,Appendicitis,Antibiotic associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis,"GLYCOPEPTIDE ANTIBIOTICS Vancomycin Mech of action:- Vancomycin acts by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It binds to the terminal dipeptide 'D-ala-D-ala' sequence of peptidoglycan units-- prevents its release from the bactoprenol lipid carrier so that assembly of the units at the cell membrane and their cross linking to form the cell wall cannot take place. pharmacokinetics:- Vancomycin is not absorbed orally. After i.v. administration, it is widely distributed, penetrates serous cavities, inflamed meninges and is excreted mainly unchanged by glomerular filtration with a t 1/2 of 6 hours. Dose reduction is needed in renal insufficiency. Toxicity:- Systemic toxicity of vancomycin is high. It can cause plasma concentration dependent nerve deafness which may be permanent. Kidney damage is also dose-related. Other oto- and nephrotoxic drugs like aminoglycosides must be very carefully administered when vancomycin is being used. Skin allergy and fall in BP during i.v. injection can occur. Vancomycin has the potential to release histamine by direct action on mast cells. Rapid i.v. injection has caused chills, fever, uicaria and intense flushing-- called 'Red man syndrome'. Uses:- Given orally (125-500 mg 6 hourly), it is the second choice drug to metronidazole for antibiotic associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis caused by C. difficile. Staphylococcal enterocolitis is another indication of oral vancomycin. Ref:- kd tripathi; pg num:-757",D

Girl is suffering from:,Treacher Collins syndrome,Pierre Robin syndrome,Craniofacial dysostosis,Sainton's disease,"Clinical Features. Wide variations in the clinical expression of this syndrome are recognized, ranging from a complete, typical form manifesting all abnormalities listed below through incomplete, abortive, and atypical forms. The important clinical manifestations of the disease are: 

Antimongoloid palpebral fissures with a coloboma of the outer portion of the lower lids, and deficiency of the eye-lashes (and sometimes the upper lids).
Hypoplasia of the facial bones, especially of the malar bones and mandible.
Malformation of the external ear, and occasionally of the middle and internal ears.
Macrostomia, high palate (sometimes cleft) and abnormal position and malocclusion of the teeth.
Blind fistulas between the angles of the ears and the angles of the mouth.
Atypical hair growth in the form of a tongue-shaped process of the hairline extending towards the cheeks.
Other anomalies such as facial clefts and skeletal deformities.

The characteristic faces of the patients have often been described as being bird like or fish like in nature.
The syndrome is thought to result from a retardation or failure of differentiation of maxillary mesoderm at and after the 50 mm stage of the embryo. The fact that the teeth of the upper jaw are usually unaffected, and ordinarily are present by the sixth week, is further evidence of retardation or arrest of differentiation at or after the second month of fetal life. The first visceral arch of the visceral mesoderm also advances secondarily to form the mandible, and again retardation occurs on the same basis.
A disease that has sometimes been confused with mandibulofacial dysostosis, because of certain clinical features in common is hemifacial microsomia (also known as oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia or Goldenhar syndrome). However, hemifacial microsomia is sporadic in the vast majority of cases, although familial cases have been reported. In addition as the name implies, this disease is unilateral and has been suggested to be related to an abnormality in the vascular supply of the head. It has been discussed in detail by Gorlin and his associates.

Both small intestine and colon are involved in 30% of cases, and only colon isinvolved in 30%.* In the affected segment, mesentric fat wraps around the bowel surface - creeping fat.* The intestinal wall is rubbery and thick, as a consequence of edema, inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy of the muscularis propria - lumen is almost always narrowed - string sign on barium meal.* There are serpentine linear ulcer along the axis of bowel.* As the intervening mucosa tends to be relatively spared, the mucosa acquires a coarse texture - Cobblestone appearance.* Narrow fissures develop between the folds of the mucosa. Fissures can penetrate deeply through the bowel wall and leading to bowel adhesions and serositis. Further extension of fissures leads to fistula or sinus tract formation.* There is transmural inflammation affecting all layers of bowel wall.* Sarcoid like noncaseating granulomas may be present in all tissue layers.* Neutrophilic infiltration into the crypts results in formation of crypt abscess.* Fibrosis of the submucosa, muscularis propria, and mucosa eventually leads to stricture formation.* There is an increased incidence of cancer of GIT in patients with long-standing CD, but the risk of cancer in CD is considerably less than in patients with chronic UC.* On barium enema there is Hose pipe (lead pipe) appearnace and cobble - stone appearnace.* Screening test is presence of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisae antibody (ASCA).

All are true regarding retinoblastoma except:,They play major role in cell cycle regulation,Require deletion of both the Rb genes,Familial variant is autosomal dominant in inheritance,Chromosome 13p 14,"Rb gene aka 'Governor of the cell cycle' is a key negative regulator of the G1/S cell cycle transition. Rb gene is located on 13q14 chromosome. To explain the two patterns of occurrence of retinoblastoma, Knudson proposed his now canonic 'two hit' hypothesis of oncogenesis. Two mutations (hits), involving both alleles of RB at chromosome locus 13q14, are required to produce retinoblastoma. In familial Retinoblastoma cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene in the germline (the first hit), and the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal RB allele is mutated in retinoblasts as a result of a spontaneous somatic mutation (the second hit). Because such second hits seem to be viually inevitable in a small fraction of retinoblasts, most individuals inheriting a germline defect in one RB allele develop unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma, and the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. In sporadic Retinoblastoma cases both normal RB alleles must undergo somatic mutation in the same retinoblast (two hits). The probability of this event is low (explaining why retinoblastoma is an uncommon tumor in the general population), but the end result is the same: a retinal cell that has completely lost RB function and becomes cancerous.

How much urine does the average adult pass each day?,1 gallon,1 1/2 Quarts,1 1/2 gallons,2 pints,"As mentioned the average adult bladder holds 500 ml (1/2 quart).
However, a male can have more as a result of his prostate enlarging post operatively or as a result of a side effect of a new medicine just stated. Nurses can see 1000 ml (1 quart) up to 1500 ml (1 1/2 quarts) emptied into a foley drainage bag just after a urinary indwelling catheter is successfully inserted. If not done by the nurses, the person has to be treated with instruments by a urologist.
Bonus Info: Nurses used to clamp shut the bladder drainage mid way for 1/2 hour in the belief that this would prevent “bladder spasms” by the rapidly contracting bladder after catheterization. This has been disproven. Now all urine is allowed to exit as fast as it does.",B

Antibiotics for treatment of Toxic shock syndrome (TSS):,Linezolid,Clindamycin,Cephalexin,Quinupristin and dalfopristin,"Ans: (b) ClindamycinRef: Harrison, 19th edition, Page 780Antibiotics for treatment of Toxic shock syndrome (TSS)TSS is usually managed in the intensive care setting and the main line of management is supportive management along with appropriate antibiotic therapy to eradicate Staph, aureus which is mostly the causative organism.Because of the increasing frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococci in the community, vancomycin is often recommended*.Beta lactamase resistant penicillins are not very effective due to emerging resistance and they may increase TSST-1 production in vitro probably due to cell lysis. Hence, if they are prescribed they are usually coprescribed with clindamycin which inhibits bacterial protein toxin production.Other treatment options are a combination of vancomycin and clindamycin for suspected serious staphylococcal infections pending culture and sensitivity.Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; which presumably acts in part via neutralizing antibodies against toxins) has been used and appears to have significant promise. At present, IVIG is used in severe or recalcitrant cases.Treatment of choice:Vancomycin (15 mg/kg q12h) plus Clindamycin (600 mg q8h).If a penicillin or oxacillin-sensitive strain is isolated, o Penicillin or Oxacillin can be given.In severe cases:IV immunoglobulins.",B

"In acute inflammation due to the contraction of endothelial cell cytoskeleton, which of the following results?",Delayed transient increase in permeability,Early transient increase in permeability,Delayed permanent increase in permeability,Early permanent increase in permeability,"Endothelial cell contraction leading to intercellular gaps in postcapillary venules is the most common cause of increased vascular permeability. Endothelial cell contractionoccurs rapidly after binding of histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes, and many other mediators to specific receptors, and is usually sho-lived (15 to 30 minutes). A slower and more prolonged retraction of endothelial cells, resulting from changes in the cytoskeleton, may be induced by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1). This reaction may take 4 to 6 hours to develop after the initial trigger and persist for 24 hours or more. ( Robbins Basic Pathology, 9th edition, page 34 )",B

Reactivation of pulmonary tuberculosis always occur at: March 2011,Lower pa of upper lobe,Upper pa of lower lobe,Lower pa of lower lobe,Apex of the upper lobe,"Ans. D: Apex of the upper lobeSecondary pulmonary tuberculosis classically involves the apex of the upper lobes of one or both the lungsSecondary tuberculosisIt is usually due to the reactivation of old lesions or gradual progression of primary tuberculosis into chronic form.The characteristics of secondary tuberculosis include extensive tissue damages due to immunologic reactions of the host to tubercle bacilli and their products.Primary vs Secondary TuberculosisWhen a host has first contact with tubercle bacilli:- An acute exudative lesion develops and rapidly spreads to the lymphatics and regional lymph nodes.- The exudative lesion in tissue often heals rapidly.- The lymph node undergoes caseation, which usually calcifies.- The tuberculin test becomes positive.If the primary lesion could not contained rapidly, the appearance of hypersensitivity to tuberculin provokes a dramatic change in the host's response to the organisms.The nonspecific inflammatory response evoked on first exposure to tubercle bacilli becomes granulomatous, evoking the formation of tubercles.The tubercle comprises an organized aggregation of enlarged macrophages that, because they resemble epithelial cells, are referred to as epithelioid cells.A peripheral collar of fibroblasts, macrophages, and lymphocytes surrounds the granuloma.Frequently the central region of epithelioid cells undergoes a characteristic caseous necrosis to produce a 'soft' tubercle, the most characteristic hallmark of tuberculosis.When the antigen load at the initial infection site and regional lymph node is large, caseation necrosis may develop and lesions may later calcify.These calcified lesions of the primary site are referred to as the Ghon complex.After the development of hypersensitivity, the infection becomes quiescent and asymptomatic in the majority of patients (about 90%).In some, however, especially the very young and adults who are immunocompromised or who have other predisposing illnesses, the primary infection may evolve into clinical disease.The progression may be local at the site of the primary lesion, or it may be at one or more distant sites where bacilli have arrived during the early hematogenous spread.In a small number of persons whose initial tuberculous infection subsidies, secondary disease occurs in spite of acquired cellular immunity.In this phase of the disease, lesions are usually localized in the apices of the lungs (remember that tubercle bacilli require oxygen for growth).In about 5% of patients, apical pulmonary tuberculosis manifests itself within 2 years of the primary infection.Because of the acquired cellular immunity, bacilli are more promptly phagocytized and destroyed by the activated macrophages.As a result, in secondary tuberculosis, lesions remain localized and dissemination of organisms the lymphatic vessels is usually prevented.Hypersensitivity promotes a more rapid caseation and fibrotic walling-off of the focus.Histologically the reaction is characteristic of tubercle formation, manifested by a local accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages.T lymphocytes and their chemotactic lymphokines play a major role in the development of tuberculous granuloma.These differences between primary infection and post-primary or reactivation are attributed to (1) resistance and (2) hypersensitivity induced by the first infection of the host with tubercle bacilli.",D

Which of the following is the most common endocrine tumour of pancreas,Insulinoma,Gastrinoma,VIPoma,Glucagonoma,"Insulinomas Beta cell tumors (insulinomas) are the most common type of PanNET( pancreatic NeuroEndocrineTumors) and may be responsible for the elaboration of sufficient insulin to induce clinically significant hypoglycemia. The characteristic clinical picture is dominated by attacks of hypoglycemia, which occur when plasma blood glucose levels fall below 50 mg/dL. The attacks consist principally of such central nervous system manifestations as confusion, stupor, and loss of consciousness. They are precipitated by fasting or exercise and are promptly relieved by feeding or parenteral administration of glucose. Most insulinomas are cured by surgical resection.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) differs from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. In this reference the DIC is most likely characterized by-,Significant numbers of schistocytes,A brisk reticulocytosis,Decreased coagulation factor levels,Significant thrombocytopenia,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Decreased coagulation factor levels DIC is characterized by excessive activation of the coagulation system. That leads to formation of microthrombi throughout the microcirculation of the body, often in a quixotically even distribution. o As a consequence of the thrombotic diathesis, there is consumption of platelets, fibrin and coagulation factors_and secondary activation of fibrinolytic mechanism. o Thus DIC can present with signs and symptoms relating to tissue hypoxia and infarction caused by the myriad microthrombi or as a hemorrhagic disorder related to depletion of elements required for homeostasis, hence the term consumption coagulopathy is used to describe D.I.C. o DIC can also lead to hemolytic anemia. It occurs due to fragmentation of red cells as they try to squeeze through the narrowed microvasculature. Schistocytes, the cells characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are quiet common in patients with D. I.0 (seen in 50%) of cause. o Like D.I.C., TT.P too, is characterized by widespread thrombosis and similar to D.I.C, the disseminated thrombosis leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. But the point to emphasize is that in TT.P the thrombus is a platelet thrombi i.e. the thrombi is composed mainly of platelets aggregates so quite unlike D.I.C. the level of coagulation factors remain normal. Robbins' States 'While D.I.C. and thrombotic microangiopathies share features such as microvascular occlusion and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, they are pathogenetically distinct. In T. and HUS (unlike DIC), activation of the coagulation cascade is not of primary impoant, and hence results of laboratory tests of coagulation such as PT and PTT are usually normal.'",C

Procalcitonin is considered as marker for:,Sepsis,Medullary carcinoma of thyroid,Vitamin D resistant rickets,Parathyroid adenoma,"ANSWER: A. Sepsis REF: Clinical endocrine oncology by Ian D. Hay, John A. H. Wass Page 91 See APPENDIX-26 below for list of tumor markers Calcitonin (CT) is the main medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) tumor marker. However, it has several limitations, including a concentration-dependent biphasic half-life, sensitivity to rapid in vitro degradation, and the presence of different isoforms/fragments. Procalcitonin (PCT), the prohormone of calcitonin, is free of these limitations but is currently used only as a sepsis marker. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antimicrobial chemotherapy is of paramount importance to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with sepsi Inflammatory markers currently in use, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) do not reliably differentiate between the systemic inflammatory response and sepsis. Procalcitonin (PCT), a precursor of calcitonin, is a 116 amino acid protein that has been proposed as a marker of disease severity in conditions such as septicaemia, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI) and fungal and parasitic infection. In particular, serial measurements are useful in order to monitor response to therapy. Together with good clinical judgement and judicious use of antimicrobial agents, PCT should serve as a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis and management of sepsis.

Level of which clotting factor falls first after giving warfarin-,V,VI,VII,VIII,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., VII o Warfarin inhibits vitamin K dependent carboxylation of clotting factors by inhibiting the enzyme Vitamin K epoxide reductase.Oral anticogulantso They act indirectly by interfering with the synthesis of vit K dependent clotting factors in liver,o They interfere with regeneration of the active hydroquinone form of vit K, which is required for the final step gamma carboxylating glutamate residues ofprothrombin (factor 11) and factor VII, IX and X. This carboxylation is essential for the ability of the clotting factors to bind Ca+2 and to get bound to phospholipid surface, necessary for coagulation sequence to proceed.Mechanism of actiono During g - carboxylation of the coagulant factor II, VII, IX and X in the liver, active vitamin K (Vit K hydroquimme) is oxidized to an epoxide (vit K epoxide),o Vit K epoxide must be reduced to vit K hydroquinone to become active once again (vit K cycle),o Vit K epoxide is reduced to vit K hydroquinone by vit K reductase.o This vit K reductase is inhibited by oral anticoagulants.o Factor VII has the shortest plasma t 1/2 (6 hrs), its level falls first when warfarin is given, followed by factor IX (t 1/2 A 24 hrs), factor X (t 1/2 40 hrs) and prothrombin (t t 1/2 60 hrs).o Though the synthesis of clotting factors diminishes within 2-4 hours of warfarin administration, anticoagulant effect develops gradually over the next 1-3 days as the levels of the clotting factors already present in plasma decline progressively. Thus oral anticoagulants are used for maintenance for anticoagulation (for initiation heparin is used).o Protein C, protein S, osteocalcin are also inhibited because these proteins also contain glutamate residues that require vit K dependent gamma carboxylation.o Protein C and Protein S are anticoagulant factor and have a shorter t 1/2 than the procoagulantfactors (II, VII, IX & X), and their more rapid decline in concentration creates a 'transient hvpercoagulable' state - Initiate anticoagulation with heparin until the effect of warfarin is well established.o Warfarin is the most popular oral anticoagulant.o Bishydroxycoumarin (Dicumarol) is the longest acting oral anticoagulant.o Ethylbiscoumacetate is the shortest acting anticoagulant.o Warfarin is rapidly and completely absorbed from intestines and is 99% plasma protein bound. Its kinetics changes from first order to zero order at higher concentrations.o For monitoring the effect of oral anticoagulant prothrombin time (PT) is used because they selectively inhibit the extrinsic pathway.",C

They may be used to smoothen off the 'wearing off', increase 'on' time and decrease 'off' time, improve activities of daily living and allow levodopa dose to be reduced. Tolcapone It is a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). It is a selective, potent and reversible nitrocatechol-type inhibitor of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In comparison with entacapone, another nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor, tolcapone has a longer half life (2.9 hours vs. 0.8 hours) and can better penetrate the blood-brain barrier, acting both in the central nervous system and in the periphery. However, entacapone is less toxic for the liver. Tolcapone improves the bioavailability and reduces the clearance of levodopa and subsequently dopamine from the CNS. Without administration of tolcapone, the beneficial effects of levodopa tend to wear off more quickly, resulting in motor fluctuations.",A

True regarding cardiomyopathy,RV dilatation is present,May result from thyroxicosis,Secondary to alcohol,All of the above,"Most cardiac muscle diseases are secondary to some other condition, e.g., coronary atherosclerosis, hypeension, or valvular hea disease. However, there are also cardiac diseases attributable to intrinsic myocardial dysfunction. Such diseases are termed cardiomyopathies (literally, 'hea muscle diseases'); these can be primary--that is, principally confined to the myocardium--or secondary presenting as the cardiac manifestation of a systemic disorder. Cardiomyopathies are thus a diverse group that includes inflammatory disorders (e.g., myocarditis), immunologic diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis), systemic metabolic disorders (e.g., hemochromatosis), muscular dystrophies, and genetic disorders of myocardial fibers. In many cases, the cardiomyopathy is of unknown etiology and thus is termed idiopathic; however, a number of previously 'idiopathic' cardiomyopathies have been shown to be the consequence of specific genetic abnormalities in cardiac energy metabolism or in structural and contractile proteins.

SLE is which type of hypersensitivity reaction: March 2005,Type I hypersensitivity,Type II hypersensitivity,Type III hypersensitivity,Type IV hypersensitivity,"Ans. C: Type III hypersensitivity Type III hypersensitivity response (Immune-complex mediated response) Examples are: Some form of glomerulonephritis Serum sickness Ahus reaction SLE Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing and anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-EN A) form the mainstay of serologic testing for SLE. Several techniques are used to detect ANAs. Clinically the most widely used method is indirect immunofluorescence. The pattern of fluorescence suggests the type of antibody present in the patient's serum. ANA screening yields positive results in many connective tissue disorders and other autoimmune diseases, and may occur in normal individuals. Subtypes of antinuclear antibodies include anti-Smith and anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies (which are linked to SLE) and anti-histone antibodies (which are linked to drug-induced lupus). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE; they are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0.5% of people without SLE. The anti-dsDNA antibody titers also tend to reflect disease activity, although not in all cases.",C
Which of the following does not cause hypoglycemia?,Insulin,Glitmepiride,Nateglinide,Acarbose,"Ans. d. Acarbose Acarbose towers glucose by inhibiting intestinal enzymes that digest carbohydrate by reducing carbohydrate digestion.Because of its mechanism of action, acarbose, when administered alone does not cause hypoglycemia in the fasting or postprandial states.Glimepiride and Nateglinide are an insulin secretogogue and it is a well known fact that insulin secretogogues are associated with hypoglycemia.''All the insulin secretogogues increase insulin secretion from the pancreas through the same mechanism, i.e. by interfering with potassium channel. All the insulin secretogogues have the potential to cause profound and persistent hypoglycemia especially in elderly individuals. 'Acarbose {Alpha Glucosidase Inhibitor)* Acarbose is alpha glucosidase inhibitor, lowers glucose by inhibiting intestinal enzymes that digest carbohydrate there by reducing carbohydrate digestion.* Because of its mechanism of action, acarbose, w hen administered alone does not cause hypoglycemia in the fasting or postprandial states.* Acarbose only produces hypoglycemia when used along with other oral hvpoglycemics.Indications:* Acarbose can decrease blood glucose in both ty pe I and type 2 DM.* Apart from insulin, acarbose is the only drug approved for the treatment of both ty pe 1 and type 2 DM.Adverse Effect:* Major adverse effect is flatulence due to fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates",D
A drug X has affinity to bind with albumin and Y has 150 times more affinity to bind with albumin than X. TRUE statement is :,Drug X will available more in tissues,Drug Y will be more available in tissues,"Free cone, of drug X in blood will me more",Toxicity of Y will be more,"Ans. is 'a' Drug X will be available more in tissues In the question drug X has 150 times lower affinity to bind with albumin than drug Y and it is clearly given in the book that highly plasma protein bound drugs are largely restricted to the vascular compartment and tends to have lower volume of distribution. So it is clear that volume of distribution of drug X will be greater than drug Y and thus it will be more available to the tissue.Now don't get confused with the option 'Free concentration of drug X in blood will be more,' Make it clear that free concentration of the drug does not depend upon the plasma protein binding.The other clinically significant implications of plasma protein binding are :Bound fraction is not available for action. However, it is in equilibrium with the free drug in plasma and dissociates when the concentration of the latter is reduced due to elimination *.High degree of protein binding generally makes the drug long acting, because bound fraction is not available for metabolism or excretion*.Highly protein bound drugs are not removed by hemodialysis*.",A

Which of the following statements regarding benzodiazepines is TRUE?,These are very unsafe drugs,These are powerful enzyme inducers,These act as GABA facilitators,The antidote for these is protamine sulphate,"Barbiturates bind to GABA-BZD-Cl channel complex to exe GABA mimetic (direct activation of GABAA receptors) as well as GABA facilitatory actions. Benzodiazepines bind to a different site (BZD receptor) and increase the binding of GABA to GABAA receptor (GABA facilitatory action). These drugs increase the frequency of Cl- channel opening. Benzodiazepines are preferred over barbiturates as hypnotic drugs due to several reasons: BZDs have flat dose response curves (these have high therapeutic index and require high dose to produce coma). These cause less hangover and less distoion of sleep architecture. Duration of REM sleep is shoened but increase in the number of REM cycles compensate for that. Nitrazepam actually increases REM sleep. These are less prone to drug interactions (because they do not induce microsomal enzymes). Abuse liability is less. BZD poisoning can be treated with specific antidote, flumazenil.",C

"A 45-year-old man receives a cardiac allograft for dilated cardiomyopathy. He has no problems with rejection, but 5 years later he has worsening exercise tolerance with increasing dyspnea and peripheral edema. Echocardiography shows a reduced ejection fraction of 35%. Which of the following pathologic abnormalities has he most likely developed in the allograft?",Amyloidosis,Constrictive pericarditis,Coronary arteriopathy,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"Nearly every allograft develops some degree of arteriopathy within 10 years, and half of the patients have significant arteriopathy by 5 years following transplantation. Unlike atherosclerosis, the smaller coronary artery branches are preferentially affected, but the result is the same: ischemic damage. The inflammation that may come from rejection is not a risk for amyloid deposition. A transplanted heart does not have a functional pericardial sac, and though there may be some fibrous adhesions following surgery, they are not constrictive. Transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy have immune dysregulation that increases the risk for both carcinomas and lymphoid malignancies, but these are unlikely to involve the heart. The immunosuppression with antirejection drugs increases the risk for infection with opportunistic agents, but these are not common and they can often be treated.",C

"The surgical specimen is sent fresh from the surgical suite to the laboratory for frozen section examination. Before cutting into the specimen, the pathologist makes a careful gross examination, which demonstrates that most of the specimen has replacement of the normally fatty breast tissue with strands of dense, white, firm tissue. In a few areas, roughly spherical lesions up to 3-cm diameter with a bluish hue to them are seen. Palpation of these areas produces a fluctuant sensation. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis based on the gross evaluation?",Breast cancer,Changes of pregnancy,Fibroadenoma,Fibrocystic disease,"While a careful pathologist will wait for appropriate frozen or permanent tissue histologic examination, the description given in the question stem is most suggestive of fibrocystic disease. The fibrous pa of the lesion forms the dense, white tissue strands, while the blue lesions are what are called 'blue-domed cysts'. The blue color comes from the presence of darkly colored fluid (which usually means old hemorrhage) within the cyst. The interior cyst wall is usually smooth. These blue-domed cysts are a ourite of examiners because they produce a distinctive gross picture and should be specifically associated with fibrocystic disease, but you should be aware that in real life they do not occur with anything near the frequency of fibrocystic disease without obvious large cysts grossly (but many smaller cysts on microscopic examination). Fibrocystic disease of the breast is a very common lesion, and a frequent source of palpable lumps in the breast, which may require fuher evaluation through either excisional biopsy (as in this case), Tru-cut needle biopsy (producing a thin core about 1 cm long), or needle aspiration (producing fluid or cells for cytology). Also know: While a diagnosis of breast cancer should obviously be confirmed microscopically before telling the clinician, invasive breast cancer can be suspected when there is a hard, white, nodular area of the breast that has irregular (but often reasonably well-defined - in contrast to the fibrotic areas of fibrocystic disease) boundaries. The changes of pregnancy cannot be reliably picked up on gross examination of the breast. Fibroadenoma , like breast cancer, tends to produce a well-defined mass lesion, but it typically has smooth borders and may have a slightly gray and slightly mucoid (e.g., shiny or oily appearing) surface on cross-section.

At autopsy, some of the children had subendothelial coronary arterial deposits that caused myocardial infarction. Laboratory testing of the infant now shows increased urinary excretion of mucopolysaccharides. Bone marrow biopsy is performed, and the accumulated mucopolysaccharides are found in macrophages ('balloon cells' filled with minute vacuoles). Which of the following enzyme deficiencies is most likely to be seen in this infant?",Adenosine deaminase,a-l-Iduronidase,Glucocerebrosidase,Glucose-6-phosphatase,"Hunter syndrome, one of the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), results from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme a-l- iduronidase. The glycosaminoglycans that accumulate in MPS include dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate. All of the MPS variants are autosomal recessive except for Hunter syndrome, which is X-linked recessive. Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a cause of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), an immunodeficiency state in which multiple recurrent infections occur after birth. Glucocerebrosidase deficiency is seen in Gaucher disease; in the most common form of the disease, there is no neurologic impairment, and patients have splenomegaly and skeletal disease as a consequence of increased lysosomal glucocerebrosides in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency leads to von Gierke disease, characterized by hepatomegaly, renomegaly, and impaired gluconeogenesis leading to hypoglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Hexosaminidase A deficiency occurs in Tay-Sachs disease; affected individuals manifest severe neurologic impairment, poor motor development, and blindness beginning in infancy.

"Despite their sho half-lives (2 hrs), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) cause a prolonged Suppression of acid secretion (up to 48 h) because:",They are prodrugs and undergo activation gradually,"They exit from the plasma and enter acid secretory canaliculi and stay there, blocking the secretion of acid for a long time","They irreversibly inhibit the proton pump molecule and hence, acid secretion requires synthesis of new proton pumps","They irreversibly inhibit the proton pump molecule and hence, acid secretion requires synthesis of new proton pumps","The only significant pharmacological action of proton pump inhibitor is dose dependent suppression of gastric acid secretion; without anticholinergic or Hz blocking action. It is a powerful inhibitor of gastric acid: can totally abolish HCl secretion, both resting as well as that stimulated by food or any of the secretagogues, without much effect on pepsin, intrinsic factor, juice volume and gastric motility. Proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole is inactive at neutral pH, but at pH < 5 rearranges to two charged cationic forms (a sulphenic acid and a sulphenamide configurations) that react covalently with SH groups of the H*K*ATPase enzyme and inactivate it irreversibly, especially when two molecules of omeprazole react with one molecule of the enzyme. After diffusing into the parietal cell from blood, it gets concentrated in the acidic pH of the canaliculi because the charged forms generated there are unable to diffuse back.

"An 8-month-old male infant is admitted to the hospital because of a bacterial respiratory infection. The infant responds to appropriate antibiotic therapy, but is readmitted several weeks later because of severe otitis media. Over the next several months, the infant is admitted to the hospital multiple times for recurrent bacterial infections. Workup reveals extremely low serum antibody levels. The infant has no previous history of viral or fungal infections. The most likely diagnosis for this infant is",Isolated IgA deficiency,X-linked agammaglobulinemia of Bruton,Chronic granulomatous disease,DiGeorge's syndrome,"In X-linked agammaglobulinemia of Bruton, B cells are absent but numbers and function of T cells are normal. This abnormality results from defective maturation of B lymphocytes beyond the pre-B stage. This maturation defect leads to decreased or absent numbers of plasma cells, and therefore immunoglobulin levels are markedly decreased. Male infants with Bruton's disease begin having trouble with recurrent bacterial infections at about the age of 9 months, which is when maternal antibodies are no longer present in the affected infant. Therapy for Bruton's disease consists primarily of IV gamma globulin. Isolated deficiency of IgA is probably the most common form of immunodeficiency. It is due to a block in the terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes. Most patients are asymptomatic, but some develop chronic sinopulmonary infections. Patients are prone to developing diarrhea (Giardia infection) and also have an increased incidence of autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), the neutrophils and macrophages have deficient H2O2production due to abnormalities involving the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These individuals have frequent infections that are caused by catalase-positive organisms, such as S. aureus, because the catalase produced by these organisms destroys the little hydrogen peroxide that is produced DiGeorge's syndrome is a T cell-deficiency disorder that results from hypoplasia of the thymus due to abnormal development of the third and fouh pharyngeal pouches. The parathyroid glands are also abnormal, and these individuals develop hypocalcemia and tetany. Congenital hea defects are also present.

False about familial polyposis colon cancer syndrome:,Autosomal recessive transmission,Associated with fibroma and osteomas,Associated with brain tumors,100% chance of colon carcinomas,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disorder in which patients develop numerous colorectal adenomas as teenagers. It is caused by mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli, or APC, gene, which you will recall is a key negative regulator of the Wnt signalling pathway. Approximately 75% of cases are inherited, while the remaining appear to be caused by de novo mutations. At least 100 polyps are necessary for a diagnosis of classic FAP. Colorectal adenocarcinoma develops in 100% of untreated FAP patients, often before age 30 and nearly always by age 50. As a result, prophylactic colectomy is the standard therapy for individuals carrying APC mutations. Colectomy prevents colorectal cancer, but patients remain at risk for neoplasia at other sites. Adenomas may develop elsewhere in the GI tract, paicularly adjacent to the ampulla of Vater and in the stomach. FAP is associated with a variety of extraintestinal manifestations including congenital hyperophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, which can generally be detected at bih, and therefore may be an adjunct to early screening.

Which of the following drugs lack vasodilatory properties that is effective in angina?,Metoprolol,Verapamil,Isosorbide dinitrate,Nifedipine,"Metoprolol: It is the prototype of cardioselective (β1) blocker; nearly 50 times higher dose is needed to block isoprenaline induced vasodilation. Some measure of inverse agonistic activity on β1 receptors has also been demonstrated. It is less likely to worsen asthma, but is not entirely safe. It may be preferred in diabetics receiving insulin or oral hypoglycaemics. Patients who complain of cold hands and feet while on propranolol, do better on metoprolol.
First pass metabolism of metoprolol is less marked than propranolol, but 90% or more is ultimately hydroxylated by CYP2D6 before excretion. There are 'extensive' and 'poor' hydroxylators of metoprolol (CYP2D6 alleles); the latter may require a lower dose.
Side effects of metoprolol are milder. It is generally given orally for hypertension, angina and CHF, but i.v. injection (5-15 mg) has been used in myocardial infarction provided bradycardia is absent.

Glycogen is viually absent from the hepatocytes in biopsy specimen. Mitochondrias are large pleomorphic and have decreased matricial density on electron microscopy. The kidney changes include swelling and fatty degeneration of proximal tubules. Astrocyte edema and loss of neuron in the brain. Reyes syndrome It is an acute self limiting metabolic insult of diverse etiology resulting in generalised nzitochondrial dysfunction due to inhibition of fatty acid )8 oxidation. Salicylates or viral infection can precipitate this metabolic impairment. The pathogenesis is thought to be damage to mitochondria caused by salicylate metabolite or some other toxin or chemical in the setting of viral infection. The reasons for mitochondria' dysfunction are unknown. No toxic factor has yet been conclusively identified but studies have suggested an etiological link among Reye's syndrome. The activities of hepatic mitachondrial enzymes including ornithine transcarbamylase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and pyruvate dehydrogenase are reduced often to less than half their normal values. Mitochondria' dysfunction leads to elevated sho chain fatty acids and hyperanzmonenzia as well as directly to cerebral edema. It is prudent to avoid the use of aspirin as an antipyretic in pediatric patients with influenza or varicella. Clinical manifestations:- Classic Reyes syndrome exihibits a stereotypic biphasic course. It usually occurs in a previously healthy child. A prodromal febrile illness, an upper respiratory tract infection or chicken pox is followed by an interval in which the child has seemingly recovered. The abrupt onsent of protracted vomiting then occurs usually within 5-7 days after the onset of viral illness. Delirium, combative behaviour and stupor may occur simultaneously within a few hours after the onset of vomiting. Neurological symptoms may rapidly progress to seizures, coma and death; focal neurological signs are absent.

In response to DNA damage it is phosphorylated by genes that sense the damage and are involved in D.N.A. repair. p53 assists in DNA repair by causing G1 arrest and inducing DNA repair genes. A cell with damaged DNA that cannot be repaired is directed by p53 to undergo apoptosis. In view of these activities p53 has been right fully called 'guardian of the genome'.With homozygous loss of p53, DNA damage undergoes unrepaired mutation, becomes fixed in dividing cells and the cells turns on to a one way street leading to malignant transformation.So p53 functions as a critical gatekeeper against the formation of cancer.

Gene silencing RNA ?,rRNA,tRNA,miRNA,None.,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., miRNA According to recent sudies a very large number of genes do not encode proteins. Instead, their products play impoant regulatory functions. The most recently discovered among this class of genes are that encode for gene-silencing RNAs, i.e. RNAs that do not encode proteins but instead inhibit gene expression (unlike classical RNAs which encode for proteins) Two gene-silencing RNAs are: Micro RNAs (miRNAs) Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 1. Micro RNA (miRNAs) Because of their profound influence on gene regulation, miRNAs are assuming central impoance in understanding normal developmental pathways, as well as pathologic conditions, such as cancer. o By current estimates there are approximately 1000 genes in humons that encodes miRNAs. Transcription of miRNA gene produces primary miRNA transcripts, which is processed within the nucleus to form another structure, called pre-miRNA. Pre-miRNA is transpoed to cytoplasm by a transpoor (Expo) protein. Dicer (an enzyme) does the additional cutting of this pre-miRNA that are about 21-30 nucleotide in length (hence called 'micro'). At this stage mRNA is still double stranded. Next, the miRNA unwinds, and single strands of this duplex are incorporated into a multiprotein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Base-pairing between the miRNA strand and it target mRNA (messenger RNA) directs RISC to either cause mRNA cleavage or repress its translation. In this way, the gene from which the target was derived is silenced (at a post-transcription level). A single miRNA can silence many target genes. 2. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) siRNAs work in similar manner as miRNA Unlike miRNA, siRNA precursors are introduced by investigators into cells. siRNA are becoming powerful tools for studying gene function and may in the future be used therapeutically to silence specific genes, such as oncogenes, whose products are involved in neoplastic transformation.",C
"Which of the following is involved when there is excessive bleeding after labor, and the laboratory studies demonstrate decreased platelets, prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, and increased fibrin split products?",Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Hemophilia A,Severe liver disease,Vitamin K deficiency,"This is a description of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a feared and often lifethreatening complication of many other disorders, including amniotic fluid embolism, infections (particularly gram negative sepsis), malignancy, and major trauma. This is suspected when a decrease in platelets and a prolongation of PT and PTT times are observed. The observed hematologic abnormalities are caused by consumption of platelets and clotting factors, caused by extensive microclot formation with accompanying fibrinolysis (reflected by the increased fibrin split products).
Hemophilia (choice B) alters the PTT without affecting the other indices.
Severe liver disease (choice C) produces alterations comparable to those in vitamin K deficiency; platelets can also be decreased secondary to a generalized metabolic marrow dysfunction, but fibrin split products would not be increased.
Vitamin K deficiency (choice D) is associated with alterations in PT and PTT, but platelets will not be decreased, nor will fibrin split products be increased.
Von Willebrand's disease (choice E) produces impaired platelet adhesion and increases the bleeding time and the PTT, but will not produce the other features described.",A

Bleeding in DIC is most closely related to ?,Raised fibrin degradation products level in blood,Prolong prothrombin time,Low serum fibrinogen level,Raised thrombin time,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Low Serum fibrinogen level 'In C fibrinogen is depleted' o DIC is a common acquired coagulation disorder resulting due to excessive activation of the coagulation system, usually due to massive tissue injury or sepsis. o The normal anticoagulants and fibrinolytic systems are overwhelmed and cannot contain the coagulation activation which becomes systemic, resulting in disseminated microvascular thrombi formation. o Platelets, coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants become depleted owing to thrombi formation. o The consumption of coagulation factors causes PT and PTT prolongations and may lead to bleeding. o Depletion of platelets may also contribute to the bleeding risk --) T BT. o The fibrinolytic system is activated to dissolve the fibrin thrombi, resulting in consumption of plasminogen from its conversion to plasmin and the formation of FDP's, including D-Dimers. FDP's can also contribute to bleeding because they impair fibrin clot formation and interfere with platelet function. Clinical Features of D.I.C. o In D.I.0 the most obvious clinical symptom is bleeding.

Robbin's pathology 8,h/pg. 771; harrison's medicine 17th/pg. Table 77-5 )Robbin's pathology 8th/pg. 771.......'Sporadic cases of medullary carcinoma present most often as a mass in the neck, sometimes associated with compression effects such as dysphagia or hoarseness. In some instances the initial manifestations are caused by the secretion of a peptide hormone (e.g., diarrhea caused by the secretion of VIP). Notably, hypocalcemia is not a feature, despite the presence of raised calcitonin levels. Screening of relatives for elevated calcitonin levels or RET mutations permits early detection of tumors in familial cases. All MEN-2 kindred carrying RET mutations are offered prophylactic thyroidectomies to preempt the development of medullary carcinomas;. Recent studies have shown that specific RET mutations correlate with an aggressive behavior in medullary carcinomas'.Harrison's medicine l7th/pg. 2246..........'Elevated serum calcitonin provides a marker of residual or recurrent MCT'.Medullary carcinomas of the thyroid# Introduction: Neuroendocrine neoplasms derived from the parafollicular cells, or C cells, of the thyroid.# Genetics: Both familial and sporadic medullary forms demonstrate activating RET mutations. Sporadic medullary carcinomas, as well as FMTC, occur in adults.# Distinct features:- Like normal C cells, medullary carcinomas secrete calcitonin, the measurement of which plays an important role in the diagnosis and postoperative follow-up of patients.- In some cases, the tumor cells elaborate other polypeptide hormones such as somatostatin, serotonin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).- Medullary carcinomas arise sporadically in about 80% of cases. The remaining 20% are familial cases occurring in the setting of MEN syndromes 2A or 2B, or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) without an associatedMEN syndrome.- Multicentricity is particularly common in familial cases.- Acellular amyloid deposits, derived from altered calcitonin molecules, are present in the adjacent stroma (distinctive feature).- Electron microscopy reveals variable numbers of intracytoplasmic membrane-bound electron-dense granules. One of the peculiar features of familial is the presence of multicentric C-cell hyperplasia in the surrounding thyroid parenchyma, a feature usually absent in sporadic lesions.# Management: primarily surgical. Unlike tumors derived from thyroid follicular cells, these tumors do not take up radioiodine. External radiation and chemotherapy may provide palliation in advanced disease.Thyroid Neoplasms# Most thyroid neoplasms present as solitary thyroid nodules;# Only 1% of all thyroid nodules are neoplastic.# Follicular adenomas are the most common benign neoplasms.0# Papillary carcinoma is the most common malignancy.0# Multiple genetic pathways are involved in thyroid carcinogenesis. Some of the genetic abnormalities that are fairly unique to thyroid cancers include:- PAX8-PPAR71 fusion = follicular carcinoma.- Chromosomal rearrangements involving the RET oncogene = papillary cancers &- Mutations of RET = medullary carcinomas.0# Follicular adenomas and carcinomas are both composed of well-differentiated follicular epithelial cells, and are distinguished by evidence of capsular and/or vascular invasion in the latter.0# Papillary carcinomas are recognized based on nuclear features (ground-glass nuclei, pseudo-inclusions) even in the absence of papillae. Psammoma bodies are a characteristic feature of papillary cancers; these neoplasms typically metastasize via lymphatics but their prognosis is excellent.# Medullary cancers are nonepithelial neoplasms arising from the parafollicular C cells and can occur in either sporadic (80%) or familial (20%) settings. Multicentricity and C-cell hyperplasia are features of familial cases. Amyloid deposits are a characteristic histologic finding.# Anaplastic carcinomas are thought to arise by dedifferentiation of more differentiated neoplasms.

These were developed subsequent to the first generation compounds and are more active against gram-negative organisms with wider coverage, including some strains resistant to first generation compounds. Few members, i.e. cefoxitin are active against anaerobes as well, but none inhibits P. aeruginosa.
They are weaker than the first  generation compounds against gram positive bacteria.
Their utility has declined in favour of the 3rd generation agents.
Cefoperazone: Like ceftazidime, it differs from other third generation compounds in having stronger activity on Pseudomonas and weaker activity on other organisms. Cefoperazone is good for S. typhi and B.fragilis also, but more susceptible to beta-lactamases.
Ceftazidime: The most prominent feature of this third generation cephalosporin is its high activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the specific indications are- febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies, burn, etc. lts activity against Enterobacteriaceae is similar to that of cefotaxime, but it is less active on Staph. aureus, other gram positive cocci and anaerobes like Bact. fragilis.

Which of the following is a monovalent cation that can reverse a digitalis induced arrhythmia?,Digibind antibodies,Lignocaine,Magnesium,Potassium,Potassium (K+) is a monovalent cation that can reverse a digitalis induced arrhythmia. K+ and Digitalis binds on same receptor on Na+/K+ATPase. Hyperkalemia decreases Digitalis toxicity (digitalis induced arrhythmia) and Hypokalemia increases Digitalis toxicity. Ca2+ facilitates the toxic actions of cardiac glycosides by accelerating the overloading of intracellular calcium stores that appears to be responsible for digitalis-induced abnormal automaticity. Hypercalcemia therefore increases the risk of a digitalis induced arrhythmia. The effects of Mg2+ are opposite to Ca2+.

Antithyroid drugs are the t/t of choice ; radioactive iodine is clearly contraindicated in pregnancy. Historically, propylthiouracil has been preferred over methimazole because transplacental spread was though to be lower, however, it has been proved that propylthiouracial and methimazole cross the placenta equally. As clearance of these drugs is very slow in the fetus, they tend to accumulate with the risk of fetal hypothyroidism and goitrogenesis. Current datas suggest that either may be used safely in the pregnant patients. The antithyroid drug dose should be minimal in order to keep the serum free thyroxine index in the upper half of the normal range. As pregnancy progresses, graves disease often improves and it is not uncommon for patients either to be on very low doses or off antithyroid drugs completely by the end of pregnancy. Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice in nursing women since very small amounts of the drug appear in the breast milk, and do not appear to affect thyroid function in the suckling baby.

First sign/symptom of renal graft rejection is?-,Fever,Rash,Increase Creatinine on exam,Tenderness,"On the basis of the time course and morphology of rejection reactions, they have been classified as hyperacute, acute, and chronic Chronic RejectionPatients present with chronic rejection late after transplantation (months to years) with a progressive rise in serum creatinine levels (an index of renal function) over a period of 4 to 6 months. Chronic rejection is dominated by vascular changes, interstitial fibrosis, and loss of renal parenchyma; there are typically only mild or no ongoing cellular parenchymal infiltrates. The vascular changes occur predominantly in the aeries and aerioles, which exhibit intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. These lesions ultimately compromise vascular perfusion and result in renal ischemia manifested by loss or hyalinization of glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. The vascular lesion may be caused by cytokines released by activated T cells that act on the cells of the vascular wall, and it may be the end stage of the proliferative aeritis described earlier.

Which of the following diuretics acts at the nephron's distal tubule?,Ethacrynic acid,Furosemide,Hydrochlorothiazide,Mannitol,"The thiazide diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, benzthiazide) promote diuresis by inhibiting reabsorption of NaCl, primarily in the early distal tubule. Ethacrynic acid and furosemide are both loop diuretics. They act by inhibiting electrolyte reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle. Note that even if you didn't know where these agents act, if you knew that they both belonged to the same class of diuretics, you could have eliminated them both as possibilities since there can't be more than one correct answer choice. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic. It is freely filtered at the glomerulus and is not reabsorbed. Its primary action occurs at the proximal tubule. Ref: Michel T., Hoffman B.B. (2011). Chapter 27.

Derivative of morphine used for diarrhoea,Oxymorphine,Diphenoxylate,Pethidine,Codeine,"Drugs used in the treatment of diarrhea include opiates (morphine, codeine), synthetic anti-diarrheals (diphenoxylate, loperamide), anticholinergics (atropine, propantheline), adsorbents (kaolin, pectin, cholestyramine resin) and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Chronic diarrhea and acute diarrhea caused by microorgansims, drugs and viruses are described. The management of diarrhea can be divided into three categories: (1) suppoive therapy (fluid and electrolyte replacement); (2) symptomatic therapy which improves the consistency of the stool and reduces the frequency of bowel movements; and (3) specific therapy aimed at treating the cause (e.g., antibiotics for bacteria-induced diarrhea) or blocking the cellular mechanisms of fluid and electrolyte loss. Most acute diarrheal conditions can be managed successfully by avoiding oral solids and ingesting carbohydrate-electrolyte solutions.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Gerstman Straussler-Scheinker disease,Huntington disease,Multiple infarct dementia,"ALS is a degenerative disease of motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord that results in progressive weakness and wasting of the extremities and eventually impairment of respiratory muscles. The disease affects motor neurons in three locations: (1) the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord; (2) the motor nuclei of the brainstem, particularly the hypoglossal nuclei; and (3) the upper motor neurons of the cerebral cortex. The injury to the motor neurons leads to the degeneration of their axons, visualized in striking alterations of the lateral pyramidal pathways in the spinal cord. The defining histologic change in ALS is a loss of large motor neurons accompanied by mild gliosis. ALS begins as weakness and wasting of the muscles of the hand, often accompanied by painful cramps of the muscles of the arm.

Antacid drug that typically causes diarrhea?,Sodium bicarbonate,Magnesium hydroxide,Calcium bicarbonate,Aluminium hydroxide,"Ans. b (Magnesium hydroxide) (Ref. KDT 6th/pg. 635).Mag. hydroxide has low water solubility: its aqueous suspension (milk of magnesia) has low concentration of OH- ions and thus low alkalinity. However, it reacts with HCI promptly and is an efficacious antacid (1 g mEq HCI). Rebound acidity is mild and brief. All Mg salts have a laxative action-by generating osmotically active MgCI, in the stomach and through Mg2+ ion induced cholecystokinin release. Soluble Mg salts are used as osmotic purgatives.Sodium bicarbonateIt reacts rapidly with HCI to produce carbon dioxide and NaCI. Formation of carbon dioxide results in gastric distention and belching. Unreacted alkali is readily absorbed, potentially causing metabolic alkalosis when given in high doses or to patients with renal insufficiency. Sodium chloride absorption may exacerbate fluid retention in patients with heart failure, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.Calcium carbonateIt is less soluble and reacts more slowly than sodium bicarbonate with HCI to form carbon dioxide and CaCI2. Calcium carbonate is used for a number of other indications apart from its antacid properties (bone mineral homeostasis). Excessive doses of either sodium bicarbonate or calcium carbonate with calcium-containing dairy products can lead to hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and metabolic alkalosis (milk-alkali syndrome).Magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxideReact slowly with HCI to form magnesium chloride or aluminum chloride and water.Because no gas is generated, belching does not occur.Metabolic alkalosis is also uncommon because of the efficiency of the neutralization reaction.Unabsorbed magnesium salts may cause an osmotic diarrhea and aluminum salts may cause constipation patients with renal insufficiency should not take these agents long-term.",B

Which of the following antimicrobial is not given in pregnancy: September 2011,Penicillin G,Quinolone,Cephalosporin,Erythromycin,"Ans. B: Quinolone Betalactam antibiotics (penicillins and most of the cephalosporins) are safe during pregnancy Erythromycin base is safe but erythromycin estolate should be avoided Quinolones and fluoroquinolones They are chemotherapeutic bactericidal drugs, eradicating bacteria by interfering with DNA replication. Quinolones inhibit the bacterial DNA gyrase or the topoisomerase II enzyme, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and transcription. Quinolones can enter cells easily porins and, therefore, are often used to treat intracellular pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. For many Gram-negative bacteria, DNA gyrase is the target, whereas topoisomerase IV is the target for many Gram-positive bacteria. Theophylline, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and coicosteroids enhance the toxicity of fluoroquinolones. Products containing multivalent cations, such as aluminum- or magnesium-containing antacids and products containing calcium, iron, or zinc, invariably result in marked reduction of oral absorption of fluoroquinolones. Many fluoroquinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A2.This inhibition causes an increased level of, for example, antidepressants such as amitriptyline and imipramine, clozapine (an atypical antipsychotic), caffeine, olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic). Fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side effects being mild to moderate. Some of the serious adverse effects that occur more commonly with fluoroquinolones than with other antibiotic drug classes include CNS and tendon toxicity.Fluoroquinolones are sometimes associated with an QTc interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions, tendon rupture, torsade de pointes and hypoglycemia. Moxifloxacin carries a higher risk of QTc prolongation Gatifloxacin has been most frequently linked to disturbed blood sugar levels, although all quinolones carry these risks. Some quinolones were withdrawn from the market because of these adverse events (for example, sparfloxacin was associated with phototoxicity and QTc prolongation, thrombocytopenia and nephritis were seen with tosufloxacin, and hepatotoxicity with trovafloxacin).Fluoroquinolones are considered high-risk antibiotics for the development of Clostridium difficile and MRSA infections. The CNS is an impoant target for fluoroquinolone-mediated neurotoxicity. Moxifloxacin came out worst among the quinolones for causing CNS toxicity. Quinolones are contraindicated if a patient has epilepsy, QT prolongation, pre-existing CNS lesions, CNS inflammation or those who have suffered a stroke.There are safety concerns of fluoroquinolone use during pregnancy and, as a result, are contraindicated except for when no other safe alternative antibiotic exists. They are also contraindicated in children due to the risks of damage to the musculoskeletal system.",B

In adults, celiac disease manifests most commonly between the ages of 30 and 60. Some patients have silent celiac disease, defined as positive serology and villous atrophy without symptoms, or latent celiac disease, in which positive serology is not accompanied by villous atrophy. Symptomatic adult celiac disease is often associated with anemia (due to iron deficiency and, less commonly, B12 and folate deficiency), diarrhea, bloating, and fatigue. Pediatric celiac disease, which affects male and female children equally, may manifest with classic symptoms, typically between the ages of 6 and 24 months (after introduction of gluten to the diet) with irritability, abdominal distention, anorexia, diarrhea, failure to thrive, weight loss, or muscle wasting. Children with nonclassic symptoms tend to present at older ages with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, or constipation. A characteristic pruritic, blistering skin lesion, dermatitis herpetiformis, also is present in as many as 10% of patients, and the incidence of lymphocytic gastritis and lymphocytic colitis also is increased. Non invasive serological tests are done before biopsy. The most sensitive tests are the presence of IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase or IgA or IgG antibodies to deamidated gliadin.

The commonest site for extragonadal germ cell tumour is-,Retroperitoneum,Sacrococcygeal region,Pineal gland,Mediastinum,"Extragonadal germinal cell syndromes are rare tumors that predominantly affect young males. Literature suggests that the only known risk factor for extragonadal germ cell tumors (EGCTs) is Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY), which is associated with mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. They are characterized by their location on the midline from the pineal gland to the coccyx. In extragonadal germ cell tumors, no evidence of a primary malignancy is present in either the testes or ovaries by radiologic imaging or physical examination. Extragonadal germ cell tumors produce a rich symptomatology and may reach large volumes if they arise in silent areas. Histologically, they mirror their gonadal counterpas with which they share the same chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity. Modern approaches to diagnosis and treatment can result in high rates of long-term survival and even cureA number of different types of germ cell tumours can develop in the mediastinum. These are much more common in males than females. They are generally put into 2 main groups Non seminoma germ cell tumours (in females these are called non dysgerminomas) - including teratomas, choriocarcinomas, embryonal carcinomas and yolk sac tumours Seminomas (in females these are called dysgerminomas) Some teratomas can be non cancerous (benign).Many people with a tumour in the mediastinum don't have any symptoms.

The mechanism of action of cephalosporin is:,Interferes with cell wall synthesis,Inhibition ol DNA gyrase,Inhibition of protein synthesis,Inhibition of DMA polymerase,"Ans: A (Interferes with cell wall synthesis) Ref: Goodman & Gilmans The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 12th ed, 2011. Pg 1479, 1493: Basic and Clinical Pharmacology by Katzung, 2012, 12th ed, Pg 792Explanation:Cephalosporin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.Its mechanism of action is similar to penicillin as both are beta lactams.Bacterial ceil wall plays a major role in the growth and development of bacteria.Peptidoglycan. a component of bacterial cell wall owing to its cross-linked structure offers strength to the cell wall.Peptidoglycan is composed of N-acetyl- glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid with cross-linking.A five amino acid peptide known as pentapeptide is linked to N-acetylmuramic acid and this peptide terminates as D-alanyl-D- alanine.Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) removes terminal alanine from D-alanyl -D-alanine and forms cross link with the adjacent peptide, thus enhancing cell wall rigidity.Beta lactam antibiotics are structurally similar to D-alanyl -D-alanine, and hence covalently bind to PBP, resulting in inhibition of transpeptidation reaction w hich is essential for the removal of D-alanine from D-alanyl-D- alanine.As peptidoglycan synthesis is inhibited by cephalosporins as any other beta lactams, the bacterial cell dies. However cell death is maximum when the cells are actively growing and synthesizing cell wall.",A

Two impoant ANCAs are: Anti-Myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA): MPO is a lysosomal enzyme normally involved in producing oxygen free radicals. MPO-ANCAs can be induced by drugs (e.g. propylthiouracil). They are associated with microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome.MPO-ANCA were previously called p-ANCA. Anti-Proteinase-3 (PR3-ANCA): PR3 is a constituent of a neutrophil azurophilic granule. It shares homology with many microbial peptides and antibodies against microbial peptides may form PR3-ANCAs.

TURNER'S SYNDROME Turner's syndrome is the most common sex chromosomal disorder in phenotypic females. Turner's syndrome results from complete or paial loss of one X chromosome (45, X) and is characterised by hypogonadism in phenotypic females Features of Turner syndrome in children The most severely affected patients generally present during infancy with edema (owing to lymph stasis) of the dorsum of the hand and foot and sometimes swelling of the nape of the neck. Swelling of the neck is related to markedly distended lymphatic channels, producing so called cystic hygroma. As these infants develop, the swelling subsides but often leave bilateral neck webbing and persistent looseness of skin on the back of the neck. Congenital hea disease is also common, paicularlypreducta/ coarctation ofAoa and bicuspid Aoic valve. C.V.S abnormalities are most impoant cause of moality in children with Turner's syndrome.

Lack of reaction to our own HLA ( human leukocyte antigen ) is known as?,Autoimmunity,Clonal selection,Tolerance,Complement system,"Immunologic tolerance is the phenomenon of unresponsiveness to an antigen-induced by exposure of lymphocytes to that antigen. Self-tolerance refers to lack of responsiveness to an individual's own antigens, and it underlies our ability to live in harmony with our cells and tissues. The mechanisms of self-tolerance can be broadly classified into two groups: central tolerance and peripheral tolerance Central Tolerance: In this process, immature self-reactive T and B lymphocyte clones that recognize self-antigens during their maturation in the central (or generative) lymphoid organs (the thymus for T cells and the bone marrow for B cells) are killed or rendered harmless. Several mechanisms silence potentially autoreactive T and B cells in peripheral tissues Anergy: Lymphocytes that recognize self-antigens may be rendered functionally unresponsive, a phenomenon called anergy. Suppression by regulatory T cells: A population of T cells called regulatory T cells functions to prevent immune reactions against self-antigens. Deletion by apoptosis. T cells that recognize self-antigens may receive signals that promote their death by apoptosis.. Robbins pathology 9e pg:214",C

Response to iron in iron deficiency anemia is denoted by-,Restoration of enzymes,Reticulocytosis,Increase in iron binding capacity,Increase in hemoglobin,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Reticulocytosis Response to iron therapy o When specific iron therapy is given, patients often show rapid subjective improvement, with disappearance or marked diminution of fatigue, lassitude, and other non-specific symptoms. This response may occur before any improvment in anemia is observed. The earliest hematological evidence of recovery is increase reticulocytes and their hemoglobin content. The reticulocytes attain a maximal value on the 5th to 10th day after institution of therapy and thereafter gradually return to normal. The reticulocyte response may not be detectable in mild iron deficiency anemia. The blood hemoglobin level is the most accurate measure of the degree of anemia in iron deficiency anemia. During the response to therapy, the red cell count may increase temporarily to values above normal, but the hemoglobin value lags behind. The red cell indices may remain abnormal for some time after the normal hemoglobin level is restored. As recovery occurs, a normocytic cell population gradually replaces the microcytic population; and one of the early signs of response to therapy is an increase in RBW from pretreatment level. When treatment is fully effective, hemoglobin reaches normal levels by 2 months after therapy is initiated, regardless of staing values.

The 51 patients represented every new case of acute leukemia subjected to cytochemical stains and flow cytometry between July 1987 and February 1989. By cell-surface marker analysis, 29 exhibited lymphocytic lineage, while 21 were myelocytic. One was mixed lineage. The PAS positivity, defined by the presence of blocks or coarse granules in 5% or more of the blasts, was found in 15 of 29 lymphoblastic leukemias and in four of the myeloblastic leukemias. However, PAS-positive lymphoblastic leukemias were negative with the other cytochemical stains: myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase. The PAS-positive myeloblastic leukemias were positive with at least one other stain. Three cases of myeloblastic leukemia exhibited greater than 10% PAS-positive blasts, with all three being acute monoblastic leukemia. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the PAS stain alone for lymphoblastic leukemia was 52% (15 true positives of 29) and 81% (four false positives), respectively.",B

Statins act by inhibiting this enzyme competitively and result in decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver. As liver requires cholesterol for synthesis of bile acids and steroid hormones, it responds by increasing the uptake of LDL from the plasma. This is done by increasing LDL receptors on its surface. Statins are most powerful LDL lowering agents.",D
Depression is not a side effect of,Propanolol,Oral contraceptives,Reserpine,Flupenthixol,"Answer is option4, flupenthisol. The antidepressive and anxiolytic efficacy of flupenthixol has been investigated in numerous controlled and open trials involving patients with endogenous, reactive as well as senile depressions. When administered at a mean daily single or multiple dose of 1-2 mg, flupenthixol proved to be a very effective and well-tolerated antidepressant. As opposed to some of the currently available antidepressants, flupenthixol has a rapid onset of action which is often displayed within the first 2-3 days following its application. Ref:",D

True about meningiomas-,More common in men,50% are malignant,95% cure rate following treatment,Arise from arachnoid layer,"Meningiomas are predominantly benign tumors that arise from arachnoid meningothelial cells. They usually occur in adults and are often attached to the dura. Meningiomas may be found along any of the external surfaces of the brain as well as within the ventricular system, where they arise from the stromal arachnoid cells of the choroid plexus.They usually come to attention because of vague nonlocalizing symptoms, or with focal findings referable to compression of the adjacent brain. Most meningiomas are easily separable from the underlying brain. Meningiomas (WHO grade I/IV) grow as well-defined dura-based masses that may compress the brain but do notinvade it. Among the varied histologic patterns are syncytial, named for whorled clusters of cells without visible cell membranes that sit in tight groups; fibroblastic, with elongated cells and abundant collagen deposition between them; transitional, which shares features of the syncytial and fibroblastic types; psammomatous, with numerous psammoma bodies ; and secretary, with gland-like PAS-positive eosinophilic secretions known as pseudopsammoma bodies. Atypical meningiomas (WHO grade II/IV) are recognized by the presence of ceain histologic features (prominent nucleoli, increased cellularity, pattern-less growth), and often have a higher mitotic rate. These tumors demonstrate more aggressive local growth and a higher rate of recurrence; they may require therapy in addition to surgery. Anaplastic (malignant) meningiomas (WHO grade III/IV) are highly aggressive tumors that may resemble a high-grade sarcoma or carcinoma, although there usually is some histologic evidence of a meningothelial cell origin.",C

Simian virus 40 (SV40) viral DNA has also been associated with malignant mesothelioma. 

Morphology

Malignant mesothelioma is a diffuse lesion that spreads widely in the pleural surface and is usually associated with extensive pleural effusion and direct invasion of thoracic structures.
Malignant mesothelioma may be of following types, depending on the type of mesothelial cells that is present in the tumor.

1. Epithelioid type

Mesothelial cells develop as epithelium like lining cells.
Consists of cuboidal, columnar or flattened cells forming tubular or papillary structures.
Epithelioid type of mesothelioma resembles adenocarcinoma of lung and can be differentiated from it by following featurs:-


Positive staining for mucopolysaccharide.
Lack of staining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).
Strong staining for keratin.
Positive staining for calretinin, wilms' tumor 1 susceptibility gene product, cytokeratin 5/6, mesothelin and thrombomodulin.
Presence of long microvilli and abundant tonofilaments but absent microvillous rootlets and lamellar bodies.

2. Sarcomatoid (mesenchymal type)

Fast multiplying bacilli are more susceptible as are many atypical mycobacteria. Added to the triple drug regimen ofRHZ it has been found to hasten the rate of sputum conversion and to prevent development of resistance. The mechanism of action of E is not fulhunderstood, but it has been found to inhibit arabinosyl transferases involved in arabinogalactan synthesis and to interfere with mycolic acid incorporation in mycobacterial cell walL Resistance to E develops slowly; in many cases it is due to alteration in the drug target gene. I\o cross resistance with any other antitubercular drug has been noted. About 3 I 4 of an oral dose of E is absorbed. It is distributed widely but penetrates meninge5 incompletely and is temporarily stored in RBCs Less than liz of E is metabolized. It is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion; plasma halflife is 4 hrs. Caution is required in its use in patients with renal disease. Patient acceptability of E is very good and side effects are few. Loss of visual acuity I colour vision. field defects due to optic neuritis is the most impoant dose and duration of therapy dependent toxicity. Because young children ma,be unable to repo early visual impairment, it should not be used below 6 years of age. With early recognition and stoppage of therapy, visual toxicity is largely reversible. Ethambutol produces few other symptoms: nausea, rashes, fever, neurological changes are infrequent. Hyperuricemia is due to interference with urate excretion. It a commonly used antitubercular drug.Ethambutol hydrochloride, following a single oral dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight, attains a peak of 2 to 5 mcg/mL in serum 2 to 4 hours after administration. When the drug is administered daily for longer periods of time at this dose, serum levels are similar. The serum level of Ethambutol falls to undetectable levels by 24 hours after the last dose except in some patients with abnormal renal function. The intercellular concentrations of erythrocytes reach peak values approximately twice those of plasma and maintain this ratio throughout the 24 hours.

'Cresentic glomerular deposits' are seen in?,Wegener granulomatosisG,Polyarteritis nodosa,Thrombangitis obliterans,All of the above,"Ans. A. Wegener granulomatosis. (Ref, Robbin's Pathology8th/pg, Table 14-2)Rapidly Progressive (Crescentic) Glomerulonephritis# RPGN is a clinical syndrome and not a specific etiologic form of GN.# Clinically, it is characterized by rapid and progressive loss of renal function with features of the nephritic syndrome, often with severe oliguria and (if untreated) death from renal failure within weeks to months.# Regardless of the cause, the histologic picture is characterized by the presence of crescents (crescentic GN).# These are produced in part by proliferation of the parietal epithelial cells of Bowman's capsule in response to injury and in part by infiltration of monocytes and macrophages.# Pathogenesis:# Crescentic glomerulonephritis (CrGN) may be caused by a number of different diseases, some restricted to the kidney and others systemic.# Types of Crescentic Glomerulonephritis:A. Type I (Anti-GBM Antibody)1. Idiopathic2. Goodpasture syndromeB. Type II (Immune Complex)1. Idiopathic2. Postinfectious/infection related3. Systemic lupus erythematosus4. Henoch-Schonlein purpura/IgA nephropathyC. Type III (Pauci-Immune) ANCA Associated1. Idiopathic2. Wegener granulomatosis03. Microscopic angiitisAnti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Antibody (Type I) Crescentic Glomerulonephritis* Anti-GBM antibody crescentic glomerulonephritis, or type I CrGN, is characterized by linear deposits of IgG and, in many cases, C3 on the GBM, as described above. In some of these individuals the anti-GBM antibodies also bind to pulmonary alveolar capillary basement membranes to produce the clinical picture of pulmonary hemorrhages associated with renal failure. These persons are said to have Goodpasture syndrome, to distinguish their condition from socalled idiopathic cases in which renal involvement occurs in the absence of pulmonary disease. Anti-GBM antibodies are present in the serum and are helpful in diagnosis. It is important to recognize type I CrGN because these individuals benefit from plasmapheresis, which removes pathogenic antibodies from the circulation.* Immune Complex-Mediated (Type II) Crescentic Glomerulonephritis* Type II CrGNs are immune complex-mediated disorders. This can be a complication of any of the immune complex nephritides, including poststreptococcal GN, SLE, IgA nephropathy, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura. In some cases, immune complexes can be demonstrated but the underlying cause is undetermined. In all of these cases, immunofluorescence studies reveal the characteristic granular ('lumpy bumpy') pattern of staining of the GBM and/or mesangium for immunoglobulin and/or complement. These individuals cannot usually be helped by plasmapheresis.Pauci-Immune (Type III) Crescentic GlomerulonephritisType III CrGN, also called pauci-immune type CrGN, is defined by the lack of anti-GBM antibodies or significant immune complex deposition detectable by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Most of these individuals have antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in the serum, which, as we have seen, have a role in some vasculitides. Therefore, in some cases type III CrGN is a component of a systemic vasculitis such as microscopic polyangiitis or Wegener granulomatosis. In many cases, however, pauci-immune CrGN is limited to the kidney and is thus called idiopathic",A

Tram track appearance on histopathology of kidney is seen in,Membranous nephropathy,Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,IgA nephropathy,Cresentric glomerulonephritis,"Refer Robbins page no 920PHOLOGY The glomeruli are large and hypercellular. The hypercellu- larity is produced both by proliferation of cells in the mesangium and so-called endocapillary proliferation involving capillary endothelium and infiltrating leukocytes. The glomeruli have an accentuated 'lobular' appearance due to the proliferating mesangial cells and increased mesangial matrix (Fig. 20-16). The GBM is thickened, and often shows a 'double- contour' or 'tram-track' appearance, especially evident in silver or PAS stains. This is caused by 'duplication' of the basement membrane (also commonly referred to as splitting), usually as the result of new basement membrane synthesis in response to subendothelial deposits of immune complexes. Between the duplicated basement membranes there is inclu- sion or interposition of cellular elements, which can be of mesangial, endothelial, or leukocytic origin.

Which among the following is a mechanism of action of colchicine?,Suppression of immunity,Increase in uric acid excretion,Decrease in uric acid synthesis,None of the above,"Colchicine is known to suppress many immune functions in the setting of crystal induced ahritis by 1. decreasing neutrophil chemotaxis 2. decreasing neutrophil adhesion 3. decreasing release of multiple inflammatory mediators 4. decreasing phagocytosis of urate crystals by neutrophils. Mechanism: Colchicine binds to tubulin and causing its depolymerization. This disrupts the mobility of granulocytes thereby decreasing its migration to the affected area. It also blocks cell division by binding to mitotic spindles. Uses: Colchicine is used in the treatment of acute gouty attacks as well as chronic gout. It is neither uricosuric nor an analgesic agent but it relieves pain in acute attacks of gout. It does not prevent progression of gout to acute gouty ahritis, but it has a suppressive, prophylactic effect that reduces the frequency of acute attacks and relieves pain.

Atherosclerosis initiation by fibroblast plaque is mediated by injury to ?,Smooth muscle,Media,Adventitia,Endothelium,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Endothelium The most acceptable hypothesis for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is 'the response to injury hypothesis'. According to this hypothesis, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the aerial wall initiated by injury to endothelium. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis Following stages occurs in the pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis: Endothelial injury Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade. Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornestone in the development of atherosclerosis. After injury, endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 and there is increased permeability to endothelium. TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression. Migration of leukocytes When VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium. Leukocytes than cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space. Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells - formation of earliest lesion, i.e. fatty streak. Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified LDL). Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-ct and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation. Maturation of plaque Smooth muscle cells synthesize extracellular matrix (especially collegen) and conve a fatty streak into a mature fibrofatty atheroma, and contribute to the progressive growth of atherosclerotic lesions.",D

This tumor, AKA nasopharyngeal carcinoma, is the most frequent childhood malignancy in ceain African regions and one of the most frequent adult tumors in southern China. Epstein-Barr virus genome has been identified in most of these neoplasms. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for a number of malignant neoplasms, such as lung cancer. In the upper respiratory tract, cigarette smoking is a strong predisposing factor for laryngeal carcinoma, but it has not been linked to the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiation injury is a well-known risk factor for many human neoplasms, such as leukemia and thyroid cancer, but not for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although any cell type is susceptible to neoplastic transformation by radiation, there is a so of hierarchy of vulnerability. The most frequent radiation-induced cancers are leukemias and thyroid carcinoma, followed by breast, lung, and salivary gland tumors. Skin, bone, and the gastrointestinal tract are least vulnerable to radiation carcinogenesis. Overexpression of the bcl-2 gene is found in most B-cell follicular lymphomas. bcl-2 is a member of a large family of genes that regulate apoptosis. bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, so that its overexpression allows neoplastic lymphocytes to survive for long periods and accumulate progressively in lymph nodes and bone marrow.

"All of the following drugs cause hypeensive crisis in patients with phaeochromocytoma, EXCEPT:",Phenoxybenzamine,Propranolol,Saralasin,Captopril,"Phenoxybenzamine is used in the treatment of hypeensive crisis in pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine secreting tumor of cells derived from adrenal medulla. Prior to surgical of tumor, patients are treated with phenoxybenzamine, an alpha blocker to preclude the hypeensive crisis that can result from manipulation of the tissues. Beta blockers or other antihypeensives should not used without first blocking the alpha adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction. The goal of pre operative management is relaxation of constricted vasculature, expansion of reduced plasma volume and normalization of blood pressure. Beta blockers can be added to it if tachycardia persists, and CCBs and ACEIs can be added if BP is not controlled with phenoxybenzamine alone. Elevated levels of plasma and urinary catecholamines and the methylated metabolites, metanephrines, are the cornerstone for the diagnosis. T2-weighted MRI with gadolinium contrast is optimal for detecting pheochromocytomas and is somewhat better than CT for imaging extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.

Coagulative necrosis is seen in:,Brain,Breast,Liver,All,"Coagulative necrosis is a form of necrosis in which the underlying tissue architecture is preserved for at least several days after the death of cells in the tissue. The affected tissues take on a firm texture. Presumably, the injury denatures not only structural proteins but also enzymes, thereby blocking the proteolysis of the dead cells; as a result, eosinophilic, anucleate cells may persist for days or weeks. Leukocytes are recruited to the site of necrosis, and the dead cells are ultimately digested by the action of lysosomal enzymes of the leukocytes. The cellular debris is then removed by phagocytosis, mediated primarily by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. Coagulative necrosis is characteristic of infarcts (areas of necrosis caused by ischemia) in all solid organs except the brain.

Which of the following is most common haemoglobinopathy,Thalassemia,Sickle cell anemia,Haemoglobin C,Spherocytosis,"On deoxygenation, HbS molecules form long polymers by means of intermolecular contacts that involve the abnormal valine residue at position 6. These polymers disto the red cell, which assumes an elongated crescentic, or sickle, shape (Fig. 11-3). The sickling of red cells initially is reversible upon reoxygenation. However, the distoion of the membrane that is produced by each sickling episode leads to an influx of calcium, which causes the loss of potassium and water and also damages the membrane skeleton. Over time, this cumu- lative damage creates irreversibly sickled cells, which are rapidly hemolyzed. Many variables influence the sickling of red cells in vivo. The three most impoant factors are * The presence of hemoglobins other than HbS. In heterozygotes approximately 40% of Hb is HbS and the remainder is HbA, which interacts only weakly with deox- ygenated HbS. Because the presence of HbA greatly retards the polymerization of HbS, the red cells of het- erozygotes have little tendency to sickle in vivo. Such persons are said to have sickle cell trait. HbC, another mutant b-globin, has a lysine residue instead of the normal glutamic acid residue at position 6. About 2.3% of Ameri- can blacks are heterozygous carriers of HbC; as a result, about 1 in 1250 newborns are compound heterozygotes for HbC and HbS. Because HbC has a greater tendency to aggregate with HbS than does HbA, HbS/HbC com- pound heterozygotes have a symptomatic sickling disorder called HbSC disease. HbF interacts weakly with HbS, so newborns with sickle cell anemia do not manifest the disease until HbF falls to adult levels, generally around the age of 5 to 6 months. * The intracellular concentration of HbS. The polyA merization of deoxygenated HbS is strongly concentration- dependent. Thus, red cell dehydration, which increases the Hb concentration, facilitates sickling. Conversely, the coexistence of a-thalassemia (described later), which decreases the Hb concentration, reduces sickling. The relatively low concentration of HbS also contributes to the absence of sickling in heterozygotes with sickle cell trait. * The transit time for red cells through the micro- vasculature. The normal transit times of red cells through capillaries are too sho for significant polymeriza- tion of deoxygenated HbS to occur. Hence, sickling in microvascular beds is confined to areas of the body in which blood flow is sluggish. This is the normal situation in the spleen and the bone marrow, two tissues promi- nently affected by sickle cell disease. Sickling also can be triggered in other microvascular beds by acquired factors that retard the passage of red cells. As described previ- ously, inflammation slows the flow of blood by increasing the adhesion of leukocytes and red cells to endothelium and by inducing the exudation of fluid through leaky vessels. In addition, sickle red cells have a greater tendency than normal red cells to adhere to endothelial cells, appar- ently because repeated bouts of sickling causes mem- brane damage that make them sticky. These factors conspire to prolong the transit times of sickle red cells, increasing the probability of clinically significant sickling. Two major consequences arise from the sickling of red cells (Fig. 11-4). First, the red cell membrane damage and dehydration caused by repeated episodes of sickling produce a chronic hemolytic anemia. The mean life span of red cells in sickle cell anemia is only 20 days (one sixth of normal). Second, red cell sickling produces widespread microvascular obstructions, which result in ischemic tissue damage and pain crises. Vaso-occlusion does not cor- relate with the number of irreversibly sickled cells and there- fore appears to result from factors such as infection, inflammation, dehydration, and acidosis that enhance the sickling of reversibly sickled cells.

As the disease progresses these nodules may coalesce into hard collagenous scars. Fibrotic lesions occur in the hilar lymph node and pleura. Sometimes thin sheets of calcification occur in the lymph nodes and are seen radiographically as egg shell calcification i.e. (calcium surrounding a zone lacking calcification. It the disease continues to progress, expansion and coalescence of lesions produce progressive massive fibrosis.* Histologically the lesions of silicosis consist of concentric layers of hyalinized collagen surrounded by a dense capsule of more condensed collagen.

Peripheral eosinophils are not increased. A renal biopsy exhibits focal glomerular necrosis with crescents and vasculitis affecting arterioles and venules. Which of the following best describes the renal disease of the patient?",Chronic nephritic syndrome,Nephrotic syndrome,Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,Type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,"Focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis is one of the early features of Wegener granulomatosis. The pathogenesis of this renal disease is not known, but it is thought to be immune mediated because most patients have antibodies to neutrophils (ANCA). These autoantibodies activate neutrophils and cause them to adhere to endothelial cells, release toxic oxygen metabolites, degranulate, and kill the endothelial cells. Exudation of inflammatory cells through the disrupted, segmentally necrotic basement membrane leads to the formation of crescents. Clinically, the disease presents as RPGN, a clinical term that is used to denote the rapid onset of renal failure caused by severe glomerular injury.

Which of the following is a prokinetic drug with no dopamine antagonism: March 2005,Chlorpromazine,Metaclopramide,Domperidone,Mosapride,"Ans. D: Mosapride Metoclopramide is a dopaminergic antagonist and peripheral serotonin receptor antagonist with GI and CNS effects Cisapride is chemically related to metoclopramide, but unlike metoclopramide, it does not cross the blood-brain barrier or doesn't have antidopaminergic effects. Therefore, it does not have antiemetic action or cause extrapyramidal effects (extreme CNS stimulation). Mosapride is a new congener of cisapride with similar gastrokinetic and LES tonic action due to 5-HT4 agonistic (major) and 5-HT3 antagonistic (minor) action in the myenteric plexus, but has not caused Q-Tc prolongation or arrhythmias. Like cisapride, it has no clinically useful antiemetic action and does not produce extrapyramidal/hyperprolactinemic side effects due to absence of D2 blocking propey.

"In metabolism of xenobiotics all of the following reactions occur in phase one, EXCEPT:",Oxidation,Reduction,Conjugation,Hydrolysis,"Xenobiotic is a compound that is foreign to the body. The principal classes of xenobiotics of medical relevance are drugs, chemical carcinogens, and various compounds that have found their way into our environment by one route or another, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and ceain insecticides. In phase 1, the major reaction involved is hydroxylation, catalyzed mainly by members of a class of enzymes referred to as monooxygenases or cytochrome P450s. Hydroxylation may terminate the action of a drug, though this is not always the case. In addition to hydroxylation, these enzymes catalyze a wide range of reactions, including those involving deamination, dehalogenation, desulfurization, epoxidation, pre oxygenation, and reduction. Reactions involving hydrolysis (eg, catalyzed by esterases) and ceain other non-P450-catalyzed reactions also occur in phase 1. In phase 2, the hydroxylated or other compounds produced in phase 1 are conveed by specific enzymes to various polar metabolites by conjugation with glucuronic acid, sulfate, acetate, glutathione, or ceain amino acids, or by methylation. Conjugation reaction occurs in phase 2 and not in phase 1. Ref: Murray R.K. (2011). Chapter 53. Metabolism of Xenobiotics. In D.A. Bender, K.M. Botham, P.A. Weil, P.J. Kennelly, R.K. Murray, V.W.

Which drug used for differentiating myasthenia gravis from cholinergic crisis?,Edrophonium,Neostigmine,Atropine,Acetylcholine,"Ans. (A) Edrophonium(Ref: KDT 8th/e p120)Patients with myasthenia gravis may present in the emergency with muscle weakness. This could be because of the aggravation of their primary problem (myasthenic crisis) or due to the overdose of the drugs like neostigmine (cholinergic crisis). The etiology of the two conditions is important to understand because in myasthenic crisis, there is deficiency of acetylcholine whereas in cholinergic crisis, there is excess of acetylcholine.Edrophonium is an inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinestrase and thus, increases the concentration of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. The increased availability of ACh causes dramatic improvement in the symptoms of patients with myasthenic crisis.In contrast, the symptoms of patients with cholinergic crisis worsen with edrophonium (because it further increases ACh in cholinergic crisis). The drug, therefore, is useful to clinically differentiate the actual cause of muscle weakness in an emergency situation.The reason for preferring edrophonium over other inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase is its short duration of action. This may be desirable for patients presenting with cholinergic crisis as the worsening in their condition would be only for a short time.",A

"A 29 year old medical student developed a positive PPD (purified protein derivative) test. She was staed on isoniazid (INH) and rifampin prophylaxis. Three months into her therapy, she began to experience muscle fasciculations and convulsions. Administration of which of the following vitamins might have prevented these symptoms?",Niacin,Pyridoxine,Riboflavin,Thiamine,"Pyridoxine, or vitamin B6, is sometimes depleted with isoniazid (INH) use. Patients with pyridoxine deficiency may experience neurologic symptoms, such as convulsions and fasciculations. The treatment of this disorder is slow IV administration of 2-5 g of pyridoxine. Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, is a disease that involves several organs, including the skin, the gastrointestinal system, and the nervous system. A useful mnemonic for remembering the symptoms of pellagra is the '4 D's': dermatitis, dementia, diarrhea, and death. These symptoms are not consistent with the patient history described in the question. Riboflavin deficiency is not typically seen alone, but rather in conjunction with other vitamin deficiencies. Dermatitis and glossitis are the most frequent clinical manifestations. Thiamine deficiency, or beri-beri, presents with dry skin and paralysis, rather than convulsions. Severe thiamine deficiency produces Wernicke's encephalopathy, with disorientation, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. This deficiency is typically seen in alcoholic patients. Ref: Amato A.A., Barohn R.J.

Hemorrhagic cystitis is caused by aEUR',Busulphan,Cisplatin,Cyclophosphamide,Doxorubicin,"Cyclophosphamide Hemorrhagic cystitis is commonly associated with Cyclophosphamide Cyclophocphamide is the most common cause of hemorrhagic cystitis. The drug Cyclophosphamide itself is not toxic. The drug toxicity is due to its hepatic conversion to the metabolite 'acrolein' which is excreted in the urine and causes damage to the bladder mucosa - It is believed that urothelial damage occurs due to direct contact of the bladder wall with acrotein which causes edema, ulceration, neovascularisation, hemorrhage and necrosis - Thus patients receiving cyclophosphamide should always receive good hydration and a .foley's catheter is often placed to ensure immediate drainage of the bladder. The hemorrhagic cystitis caused by cyclophosphamide can be reduced in intensity or prevented by intravenous administration of 'MESNA' -MESNA is a thiol compound. The .free (Thiol) groups of MESNA combine directly with double bond of acrolein of form a stable nontoxic compound.

Lesions manifest as firm to fluctuant pea-sized nodules. These are grossly translucent and microscopically lack a true cell lining, because they arise by cystic degeneration of connective tissue. Lesions can be multilocular through coalescence of adjacent areas of myxoid change. The cyst fluid is similar to synovial fluid, although there is no communication with the joint space. Ganglions are usually completely asymptomatic. Classically, these can be treated by 'Bible therapy'; whacking them with a large tome is usually sufficient to rupture the cyst, and re- accumulation is uncommon. Herniation of synovium through a joint capsule or massive enlargement of a bursa can produce a synovial cyst. A good example is the Baker cyst that occurs in the popliteal fossa.GANGLION CYST (WRIST CYST, BIBLE CYST, OR DORSAL TENDON CYST)# It may also be referred to as a mucous cyst, a mucinous cyst or a synovial cyst.# These are the most common swellings in the hand.# The swelling is smooth, well defined, fluctuant and transilluminable.# It is usually attached to a tendon sheath (lining which lubricates the tendon) in the hand or wrist;# Whether this is due to injury, a myxomatous degenerative process, or a subtle abnormality is debatable. Histology shows a compressed collagen sheath filled with a mucoid substance.# Rx:- A few resolve with aspiration or compression ('hitting with the family bible').- Surgery should be meticulous otherwise recurrence is likely.- Ganglia around the wrist should be traced down to their source, usually the scapholunate ligament and sometimes the scapho-trapezio-trapezioid joint.Educational Points:# Acute paronychia is the most common infection of the hand.# Superficial spreading melanomas are the most common (64 per cent) melanoma.# Nodular melanoma is the most malignant melanoma.",D

Which propey of haemoglobin is affected in sickle cell anaemia,Stability,Function,Affinity,Solubility,"On deoxygenation, HbS molecules form long polymers by means of intermolecular contacts that involve the abnormal valine residue at position 6. These polymers disto the red cell, which assumes an elongated crescentic, or sickle, shape (Fig. 11-3). The sickling of red cells initially is reversible upon reoxygenation. However, the distoion of the membrane that is produced by each sickling episode leads to an influx of calcium, which causes the loss of potassium and water and also damages the membrane skeleton. Over time, this cumu- lative damage creates irreversibly sickled cells, which are rapidly hemolyzed. Many variables influence the sickling of red cells in vivo. The three most impoant factors are * The presence of hemoglobins other than HbS. In heterozygotes approximately 40% of Hb is HbS and the remainder is HbA, which interacts only weakly with deox- ygenated HbS. Because the presence of HbA greatly retards the polymerization of HbS, the red cells of het- erozygotes have little tendency to sickle in vivo. Such persons are said to have sickle cell trait. HbC, another mutant b-globin, has a lysine residue instead of the normal glutamic acid residue at position 6. About 2.3% of Ameri- can blacks are heterozygous carriers of HbC; as a result, about 1 in 1250 newborns are compound heterozygotes for HbC and HbS. Because HbC has a greater tendency to aggregate with HbS than does HbA, HbS/HbC com- pound heterozygotes have a symptomatic sickling disorder called HbSC disease. HbF interacts weakly with HbS, so newborns with sickle cell anemia do not manifest the disease until HbF falls to adult levels, generally around the age of 5 to 6 months. * The intracellular concentration of HbS. The polyA merization of deoxygenated HbS is strongly concentration- dependent. Thus, red cell dehydration, which increases the Hb concentration, facilitates sickling. Conversely, the coexistence of a-thalassemia (described later), which decreases the Hb concentration, reduces sickling. The relatively low concentration of HbS also contributes to the absence of sickling in heterozygotes with sickle cell trait. in the spleen and the bone marrow, two tissues promi- nently affected by sickle cell disease. Sickling also can be triggered in other microvascular beds by acquired factors that retard the passage of red cells. As described previ- ously, inflammation slows the flow of blood by increasing the adhesion of leukocytes and red cells to endothelium and by inducing the exudation of fluid through leaky vessels. In addition, sickle red cells have a greater tendency than normal red cells to adhere to endothelial cells, appar- ently because repeated bouts of sickling causes mem- brane damage that make them sticky. These factors conspire to prolong the transit times of sickle red cells, increasing the probability of clinically significant sickling. Two major consequences arise from the sickling of red cells (Fig. 11-4). First, the red cell membrane damage and dehydration caused by repeated episodes of sickling produce a chronic hemolytic anemia. The mean life span of red cells in sickle cell anemia is only 20 days (one sixth of normal). Second, red cell sickling produces widespread microvascular obstructions, which result in ischemic tissue damage and pain crises. Vaso-occlusion does not cor- relate with the number of irreversibly sickled cells and there- fore appears to result from factors such as infection, inflammation, dehydration, and acidosis that enhance the sickling of reversibly sickled cells.

Wound contraction is mediated by -,Myofibroblasts,Epithelial cells,Collagen,Elastin,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., MyofibroblastsWound contraction is a feature of healing by secondary intention. This is the feature that most clearly differentiates primary from secondary healing.Contraction has been ascribed to the presence of myofibroblasis - altered fibroblasts that have the ultrastructual characteristics of smooth muscle cells.In above explanation, I have explained healing in general. Here I am giving brief description of wound healing. Skin wound healingSkin wounds are classically described to heal by primary or secondary intention.A. Healing by primary intentionIt occurs in wounds with opposed edges, e.g., surgical incision.The healing process follows a series of sequantial steps : ?Immediate after incisionIncisional space filled with blood containing fibrin and blood cells.Dehydration of the surface clot forms scab that covers the wound.Within 24 hoursNeutrophils appear at the margins of wound.In 24-48 hoursEpithelial cells move from the wound edges along the cut margin of dermis, depositing basement membrane components as they move.They fuse in the midline beneath the surface scab, producing a continuous but thin epithelium layer that closes the wound.By day 3Neutrophils are largely replaced by macrophages.Granulation tissue progressively invades the incision space.Collegen fibers now present in the margin but do not bridge the incision.ci By day SIncisional space is largely filled with granulation tissue.Neovascularization is maximum.Collegen fibrils become more abundant and begin to bridge the incision.The epidermis recovers its normal thickness.Et During second weekLeukocytes and edema have disappeared.There is continued accumulation of collegen and proliferation of fibroblast.o By the end of first monthScar is made up of a cellular connective tissue devoid of inflammatory infiltrate covered now by intact epidermis.B. Healing by secondary intentionIt occurs in wounds with seperated edges in which there is more extensive loss of cells and tissue.Regeneration of parenchymal cells cannot completely restore the original architecture, and hence abundant granulation tissue grows.Healing by secondary intention differ from primary intention in several respects : ?1. Inflammatory reaction is more intense.2. Much larger amounts of granulation tissue are formed.3. Wound contraction occurs --> Feature that most clearly differentiate secondary from primary healing.Permanent wound contraction requires the action of myolifibroblasts - Fibroblasts that have the ultrastructural characteristic of smooth muscle cells.",A

However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. Anti-HBc IgM The infectious virion contains an inner 'core paicle' enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core paicle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein, alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen, or HBcAg. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease. HbeAg and anti-HBe Sholy after the appearance of the HBsAg, the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) will appear. Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity During the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards. This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgG If the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBsAg will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen, (anti-HBs and anti HBc IgG). The time between the removal of the HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the window period. A person negative for HBsAg but positive for anti-HBs has either cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously. Hepatitis B carriers Individuals who remain HBsAg positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers. Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, as revealed by biopsy. Carriers who have seroconveed to HBeAg negative status, paicularly those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others. PCR tests They have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens. These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment. Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.",B

Which of the following drugs can prolong survival in patients with CHF?,Furosemide,Inarnrinone,Losartan,Digoxin,"Congestive heart failure (CHF) continues to be a lethal end stage of cardiovascular diseases caused by hypertension, coronary heart disease, valve deformity, diabetes and cardiomyopathy. Current therapy for CHF can maintain function, improve quality of life, and prolong survival. Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), and digoxin remain in standards of therapy. Diuretics remains an important component of the symptomatic management of patients with CHF, but severely II patients may require additional agents. One option frequently used in patients who exhibit resistance to loop diuretics is an infusion of low-dose dopamine. Combination diuretics may effectively increase urine output, with the addition of thiazide or spironolactone. Documentation of the clinical benefit of ACE inhibitors represents the most important advance in therapeutics for CHF in the last decade. ACE inhibitors improve left the ventricular function, and survival and unless contraindicated, patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction should receive high dose ACE inhibitor with a diuretic if there is peripheral edema. For patients who cannot take an ACE inhibitor the combination of hydralazine and nitrates may offer some prognostic benefit. Digoxin has been the traditional first drug of choice for CHF, but with protracted controversy about its efficacy and safety.",C
A single nucleotide change in a codon on chromosome 11 that causes valine to replace glutamic acid at the sixth position of the b chain of hemoglobin.peripheral blood film of the patient is given,a thalassemia,Hereditary spherocytosis,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,Sickle cell anemia,"Hemoglobin S (Hb S) is formed by the replacement of glutamic acid by valine in the sixth position in the b chain of hemoglobin. On deoxygenation, Hb S polymerizes and the red cells sickle. In patients heterozygous for Hb S (sickle cell trait, Hb AS), there is approximately 45% Hb S and 55% Hb A. Because of the content of Hb A, erythrocytes only sickle at low oxygen tension and symptoms are much milder than in sickle cell disease. Hb F does not react with hemoglobin S, so that patients who have Hb S and large amounts of Hb F, as occurs in newborns with sickle cell disease, are asymptomatic. Clinically, sickle cell disease is characterized by the triad of chronic hemolytic anemia, vascular occlusion, and vulnerability to infection. The severe chronic hemolytic anemia leads to chronic hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), which leads to pigmented gallstones. Vascular occlusion results in leg ulcers, renal papillary necrosis, and multiple infarcts, which may cause severe bone pain. Repeated splenic infarcts cause progressive fibrosis and splenic atrophy (autoinfarction). Rather than hypersplenism, most adults have a small, functionless, fibrotic spleen. The lack of splenic function along with defects in the alternate complement pathway predispose to infections such as Salmonella osteomyelitis and pneumococcal infections. The vasoocclusive disease also leads to painful crises, hand-foot syndrome in children (consisting of the typical triad of fever, pallor, and symmetric swelling of hands and feet), and infarctive crises. In patients not having yet undergone splenic autoinfarction (usually children), massive splenic sequestration (sequestration crisis) may lead to rapid splenic enlargement, hypovolemia, and shock. Patients with sickle cell disease have a normocytic anemia with a corrected reticulocyte count of greater than 3%. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is zero because the sickled red cells cannot aggregate and settle in the test tube. Hydroxyurea has recently been approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease because it increases the synthesis of hemoglobin F, thus reducing the severity of the disease Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",D

"Histologic sections (routine H&E stain) of lung reveal the alveoli to be filled with pale, nongranular pink fluid. Neither leukocytes nor erythrocytes are present within this fluid. What is the most likely (i.e., most common) cause of this abnormality?",Bacterial pneumonia,Congestive hea failure,Lymphatic obstruction by tumor,Pulmonary embolus,") Pulmonary edema refers to excess accumulation of fluid in the extravascular spaces of the lung. Pulmonary edema can be classified based on the etiology into cardiogenic pulmonary edema and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from abnormalities of hemodynamic (Starling) forces, while noncardiogenic pulmonary edema results from cellular injury. Causes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema include increased hydrostatic forces, as seen with congestive hea failure (the most common cause of pulmonary edema); decreased oncotic pressure, such as resulting from decreased albumin levels; and lymphatic obstruction. Noncardiogenic edema may be the result of either endothelial injury (infections, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, or trauma) or alveolar injury (from inhaled toxins, aspiration, drowning, or near drowning). Microscopically, pulmonary edema reveals the alveoli to be filled with pale pink fluid. Cardiogenic edema may lead to alveolar hemorrhages and hemosiderin-laden macrophages (hea failure cells). Where cardiogenic edema is present, chest x-rays show an increase in the caliber of the blood vessels in the upper lobes, perivascular and peribronchial fluid ('cuffing'), and Kerley B lines (fluid in the interlobular septa). Noncardiogenic edema produces a 'whiteout' of the lungs. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",B

"True about telomeres:
(A) Made up of repeated sequence of TTAGGG
(B) Telomerase shortens it
(C) it is shortened in cancer cells,
(D) It is responsible for cell ageing",AD,AB,BC,CA,"'At birth, human telomeres are 15- to 20-kb pairs long and are composed of tandem repeats of a sixnucleotide
sequence (TTAGGG) that associates with specialized telomere-binding proteins to form a Tloop
structure that protects the ends of chromosomes from being mistakenly recognized as damaged. The
loss of telomeric repeats with each cell division cycle causes gradual telomere shortening, leading to
growth arrest (called senescence) when one or more critically short telomeres trigger a p53-regulated
DNA-damage checkpoint response'- 

How dividing cells can count their divisions is under intensive investigation. One likely mechanism is
that with each cell division, there is incomplete replication of chromosome ends (telomere shortening),
which ultimately results in cell cycle arrest. Telomeres are short repeated sequences of DNA (TTAGGG) present at the linear ends of chromosomes that are important for ensuring the complete replication of chromosome ends and protecting chromosomal termini from fusion and degradation.
When soma tic cells replicate, a small section ofthe telomere is not duplicated, and telomeres become progressively shortened.
As the telomeres become shorter, the ends of chromosomes cannot be protected and are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. The lengths of the telomeres are normally maintained by nucleotide addition mediated by an enzyme called telomerase. 
Telomerase is a specialized RNA-protein complex that uses its own RNA as a template for adding nucleotides to the ends of
chromosomes The activity of telomerase is repressed by regulatory proteins, which restrict telomere elongation, thus providing a length sensing mechanism. Telomerase activity is expressed in germ cells and is present at low levels in stem cells, but it is usually absent in most somatic tissues. Therefore, as cells age, their telomeres become shorter, and they exit the cell cycle, resulting in an inability to generate new cells to replace damaged ones. Conversely, in immortal cancer cells, telomerase is reactivated, and telomeres are not shortened, 
suggesting that telomere elongation might be an important—possibly essential—step in tumor formation.
Despite such alluring observations, however, the relationship of telomerase activity and telomeric length
to aging and cancer still needs to be fully established
Germ cells and stem cells both contain active telomerase, but only the germ cells have sufficient levels of the enzyme to stabilize telomere length completely. Telomerase activation in cancer cells inactivates
the teleomericclock that limits the proliferative capacity of normal somatic cells.",A

This blockage leads to increased intracranial pressure, which manifests with nausea, vomiting, headache,nuchal rigidity, and mental status changes. If surgery is not performed promptly, cerebellar tonsillar herniation and rapid death will ensue. In children, medulloblastoma and ependymoma are the most frequent neoplasms presenting in this manner. There is no evidence in this case suggesting that acute hemorrhage into the 4th ventricular cavity has occurred, nor is medulloblastoma typically associated with this complication. CNS tumors that frequently bleed are metastases from melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and choriocarcinoma. Alterations in medullary function lead to cardiorespiratory instability and may be caused by direct tumor compression or infiltration of the medulla, neither of which is suppoed by MRI findings in this case. Infiltration of the cerebellar vermis is ceainly seen in many cases of medulloblastoma, a tumor that arises from this midline cerebellar structure.

"The percentage of pulmonary emboli, that proceed to an infraction, is approximate -",0-5%,5-15%,20-30%,30-40%,"Only about 10% of emboli actually cause infarction- Regarding morphologic consequences of embolic occlusion of pulmonary arteries - Robbins 7th/742
Why only 10% of emboli cause infarction?

Because the lungs have a dual blood supply.
In patients with adequate cardiovascular function, the bronchial arterial supply can often sustain the lung parenchyma despite obstruction to the pulmonary arterial system.
Pulmonary embolism usually causes infarction only when the circulation is already inadequate as in patients with heart or lung disease.
For this reason, pulmonary infarcts tend to be uncommon in the young.

Consequences of pulmonary embolism

The effects of pulmonary embolism depend mainly on the size of the occluded vessel, the number of emboli, and on cardiovascular status of the patients.
The following consequences can result.

1. Asymptomatic

Most pulmonary emboli (60% to 80%) are clinically silent because they are small.
With time, they undergo organization and are incorporated into the vascular wall.

2.   Sudden death (cardiovascular collapse)

Massive pulmonary embolism may result in instantaneous death, without occurrence of chest pain and dyspnea.

3.   Acute cor pulmonale (Acute right heart failure)

Numerus small emboli may obstruct most of the pulmonary circulation resulting in acute heart failure.

4.   Pulmonary infarction

Embolic obstruction of small end-arteriolar pulmonary branches can cause pulmonary infarction.
About three-fourths of all infarcts affect the lower lobes, and in more than half, multiple lesions occur.
Characteristically, they extend to the periphery of the lung substance as a wedge with the apex pointing toward the kilns of the lung.
The pulmonary infarct is classically hemorrhagic infarct.

5.   Pulmonary hemorrhage

Embolic obstruction of medium-sized arteries may result in pulmonary hemorrhage.

6.   Pulmonary hypertension

Multiple emboli over time may cause pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure.",B

Following the synthesis of proinsulin, zinc promotes the formation of proinsulin hexamers and increases its solubility before conversion to insulin. Proinsulin binds 30 zinc ions, of which 2 to 4 are coordinated within the molecule. These zinc ions appear to be impoant for the solubility of proinsulin hexamers. With the removal of C-peptide from each proinsulin monomers, the resulting insulin increases its coordination of zinc to up to six ions per hexamer, which decreases its solubility and increases its crystallization within the secretory vesicle. The insulin, stored as crystalline hexamer, is resistant from proteolytic attack within the vesicle. Upon release of insulin into the bloodsteam, zinc is also released and the insulin becomes soluble in the blood.",B
A routine complete blood count performed on a 22-year-old medical student reveals an abnormality in the differential leukocyte count. She has been complaining of frequent sneezing and 'watery' eyes during the past several weeks and repos that she frequently had such episodes in the spring and summer. Which of the following cell types is most likely to be increased in the last phase reaction?,Basophils,Eosinophils,Lymphocytes,Monocytes,"This type of reaction is primarily mediated by the release of histamine from tissue mast cells In response to antigen and other stimuli, including cytokines produced at the local site, the T cells differentiate into Th2 cells, which secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. In the late-phase reaction, leukocytes are recruited that amplify and sustain the inflammatory response without additional exposure to the triggering antigen. Eosinophils are often an abundant leukocyte population in these reactions. IL-5 is involved in the development and activation of eosinophils, which are impoant effectors of type I hypersensitivity. The associated cellular infiltrate and peripheral blood findings represent mobilization and increased numbers of eosinophils. The symptoms repoed are those of seasonal rhinitis, better known as 'hay fever,' a manifestation of type I hypersensitivity.",B

Skin cancers develop due to sunlight exposure induced by,UVA rays,UVD rays,UVC rays,UVB rays,"Ultraviolet radiation is of 3 types; UV-A, UV-B and UV-C.
• UVA causes melanin oxidation with transient immediate darkening. Repeated exposure to UV radiation cause degenerative changes in elastin and collagen leading to wrinkling increased laxity and a leathery appearance. It is however used therapeutically in PUVA therapy for the management of vitiligo, psoriasis and cutaneous T cell lymphomaQ.
• UVB can cause skin damage by formation of reactive oxygen species and formation of pyrimidine dimmers between adjacent pyrimidines on the same DNA strand. The latter can cause double base substitutions in the p53 resulting in
the development of skin cancers. So, it is the most dangerous for humans. Exposure to UV rays also induces DNA repair, apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. The absence of this protective mechanism is seen in patients of Xeroderma pigmentosum causing high incidence of skin cancers.
• UVC is not reaching earth because it gets filtered by the protective ozone layer.",D

Increasing number of interactions of drug with target protein (Ref: Rational Approaches to Improving Selectivity in Drug Design by David J. Huggins, Woody Sherman, and Bruce Tidor; J Med Chem. 2012 February 23; 55(4) : 1424-1444.Problems in Drug Designing:Traditionally, drug design has been pursued with the primary objective of finding a compound that binds with high affinity to a target of interest.Conceptually, the problem of designing for a particular selectivity profile is significantly more complex than designing for high affinity to a single target.The underlying problem is challenging because it is necessary to evaluate energy differences for each ligand binding to a panel of targets and decoys rather than to a single desirable target.Drug DesigningDesigning a drug with the appropriate balance of avoidance of undesirable targets (narrow selectivity) and coverage of one or more targets of interest (broad selectivity, also referred to as promiscuity) is a continual drug development challenge.In many cases this objective is attained through trial and error, but there are rational approaches that can guide the tuning of selectivity'.Traditionally, drug design has been pursued with the primary objective of finding a compound that binds with high affinity to a target of interest.Recently, considerable effort has been expended measuring off-target interactions with partners such as ion channels (including the Kv 11.1 potassium ion channel hERG),cytochrome P450s (CYPs), and other proteins that can lead to adverse side effects.Other considerations, such as family or subtype selectivity have gamed considerable attention for targets with homologues that bind to the same or similar native substrates.While it is most common to design away from interactions with undesirable proteins, in other cases it is desirable to hit a panel of targets.Promiscuity must itself be selective for a given subset of targets, and nonspecific binding is always undesirable.In general, there is a fine balance in designing the appropriate level of narrow and broad selectivity, and one must determine the design criteria for selectivity based on the relevant biological processes.Conceptually, the problem of designing for a particular selectivity profile is significantly more complex than designing for high affinity to a single target.The underlying problem is challenging because it is necessary to evaluate energy differences for each ligand binding to a panel of targets and decoys rather than to a single desirable target.Computational methods are of limited accuracy when predicting affinities of individual complexes: these difficulties are compounded when multiple relative affinities are required to accurately design appropriate specificities.This problem becomes increasingly more difficult if the proteins anchor ligands have significant flexibility, as the size of the search space increases enormously.Essentially, designing for selectivity is significantly more complex than designing for affinity for two reasons:Because of the multifactorial nature of the taskBecause of the inherent difficulty of considering all modes of relaxation with sufficient accuracy, particularly when ligands bind decoy receptors.",C

"During a routine breast self-examination, a 35-year-old female is concerned because her breasts feel 'lumpy.' She consults you as her primary care physician. After performing an examination, you reassure her that no masses are present and that the 'lumpiness' is due to fibrocystic changes. Considering this clinical opinion, a pathologic finding that is consistent with the nonproliferative form of fibrocystic change is",A blue-domed cyst,A radial scar,Atypical hyperplasia,Papillomatosis,"Fibrocystic change of the breast is one of the most common features seen in the female breast. It is most likely associated with an endocrine imbalance that causes an abnormality of the normal monthly cyclic events within the breast. These fibrocystic changes are subdivided into nonproliferative and proliferative changes. Nonproliferative changes include fibrosis of the stroma and cystic dilation of the terminal ducts, which when large may form blue-domed cysts. A common feature of the ducts in nonproliferative changes is apocrine metaplasia, which refers to epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with apical snouts. Proliferative changes include epithelial hyperplasia of the ducts. This hyperplastic epithelium may form papillary structures (papillomatosis when pronounced), or may be quite abnormal (atypical hyperplasia). Two benign, but clinically impoant, forms of proliferative fibrocystic change include sclerosing adenosis and radial scar. Both of these may be mistaken histologically for infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but the presence of myoepithelial cells is a helpful sign that points to the benign nature of the proliferation. Sclerosing adenosis is a disease of the terminal lobules that is typically seen in patients 35 to 45 years old. It produces a firm mass, most often located in the upper outer quadrant. Microscopically there is florid proliferation of small ductal structures in a fibrous stroma, which on low power is stellate in appearance and somewhat maintains the normal lobular architecture. A radial scar refers to ductal proliferation around a central fibrotic area. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",A

Thalidomide is useful in: March 2007,Treatment of leprosy,Treatment of type II lepra reaction,Treatment of type I lepra reaction,Treatment of neuritic leprosy,"Ans. B: Treatment of type II lepra reaction Thalidomide is a sedative-hypnotic, and multiple myeloma medication. The drug is a potent teratogen. Thalidomide was chiefly sold during the late 1950s and early 1960s to pregnant women, as an antiemetic to combat morning sickness. Children were born with severe malformities, including phocomelia, because their mothers had taken thalidomide during pregnancy. Apa from its infamous tendency to induce bih defects and peripheral neuropathy, the main side effects of thalidomide include fatigue and constipation. It also is associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis especially when combined with dexamethasone,for treatment of multiple myeloma. In multiple myeloma patients, concomitant use with zoledronic acid may lead to increased incidence of renal dysfunction.

AGE-RAGE signaling axis is related to,Ageing,Oncogenesis,Diabetes,Alzheimer disease,"AGE-RAGE signalling axis is related to chronic complications in diabetes.Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed as a result of nonenzymatic reactions between intracellular glucose-derived dicarbonyl precursors (glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone) with the amino groups of both intracellular and extracellular proteins. The natural rate of AGE formation is greatly accelerated in the presence of hyperglycemia. AGEs bind to a specific receptor (RAGE) that is expressed on inflammatory cells (macrophages and T cells), endothelium, and vascular smooth muscle.Robbins pathology 9e pg: 1115",C

NARP is a,Lipid storage disorder,Glycogen storage disorder,Mitochondrial disorder,Lysosomal storage disorder,"Neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) is a condition that causes a variety of signs and symptoms chiefly affecting the nervous system. Beginning in childhood or early adulthood, most people with NARP experience numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy); muscle weakness; and problems with balance and coordination (ataxia). Many affected individuals also have vision loss caused by changes in the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina). In some cases, the vision loss results from a condition called retinitis pigmentosa. This eye disease causes the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually to deteriorate. Learning disabilities and developmental delays are often seen in children with NARP, and older individuals with this condition may experience a loss of intellectual function (dementia). Other features of NARP include seizures, hearing loss, and abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heabeat (cardiac conduction defects). These signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals.",C

All of the following are tumor suppressor genes except: September 200,NF1,pRb,SMAD1,p53,"Ans. C: SMAD1Tumor suppressor gene/anti-oncogene is a gene that protects a cell from one step on the path to cancer. When this gene is mutated to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes.The first tumor-suppressor protein discovered was the Retinoblastoma protein (pRb/RB1) in human retinoblastoma. Another impoant tumor suppressor is the p53 tumor-suppressor protein encoded by the TP53 gene.Homozygous loss of p53 is found in 70% of colon cancers, 30-50% of breast cancers, and 50% of lung cancers. Mutated p53 is also involved in the pathophysiology of leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas, and neurogenic tumors. Abnormalities of the p53 gene can be inherited in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which increases the risk of developing various types of cancers. PTEN acts by opposing the action of PI3K, which is essential for anti-apoptotic, pro-tumorogenic Akt activation.NFl somatic mutations is associated with neuroblastomas and neurofibromatosis type 1 is associated with inherited mutations of NFl.Other examples of tumor suppressors include APC, SMAD2, SMAD4 and ST14.",C

"Histopathologically, Abscess is defined as",Localised collection with necrotic cells surrounded by the dead tissue,Infection involving the dermis and subcutaneous fat,Necrosis caused by a critically insufficient blood supply resulting cell death,Abnormal pattern growth of tissue with invasion,"(A) Localised collection with necrotic cells surrounded by the dead tissue # ABSCESS: is a collection of pus that has built up within the tissue of the body. Abscess shows redness, pain, warmth, and swelling with fluid filled. Area of redness often extends beyond the swelling It is a localized collection of pus (purulent inflammatory tissue) caused by suppuration buried in a tissue, an organ, or a confined space, lined by pyogenic membrane.> Gangrene is a type of necrosis caused by a critically insufficient blood supply. This potentially life-threatening condition may occur after an injury or infection, or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation. The primary cause of gangrene is reduced blood supply to the affected tissues, which results in cell death.> Cellulitis It is a bacterial infection involving the inner layers of the skin. Specifically affects the dermis & subcutaneous fat Signs & symptoms -- area of redness which increases in size over a few days. Borders of the area of redness are generally not sharp and the skin may be swollen. Redness often turns white when pressure is applied, this is not always the case. The area of infection is usually painful. Neoplasm is an abnormal growth of tissue, which if it forms a mass, is commonly referred to as a tumour or tumor. Prior to the abnormal growth of tissue, as neoplasia, cells often undergo an abnormal pattern of growth, such as metaplasia or dysplasia",A
Early diagnosis of acute hepatitis B infection is done by:March 2011,Presence of HBeAg in serum,Presence of IgM anti-HBc in serum,Presence of HBsAg in serum,Presence of IgG anti-HBc in serum,"Ans. B: Presence of IgM anti-HBc in serumAlthough HBsAg is the earliest virological marker in serum of patients with acute hepatitis B, it does not help in establishing the diagnosis of acute Hepatitis B infection (it may be seen in chronic cases or carrier state)It is the presence of IgM anti-HBc that confirms an acute Hepatitis B infectionHBsAgThe hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection.However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host.Anti-HBc IgMThe infectious virion contains an inner 'core paicle' enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core paicle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein, alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen, or HBcAg.During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease.HbeAg and anti-HBeSholy after the appearance of the HBsAg, the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) will appear.Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivityDuring the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards.This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication.Anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgGIf the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBsAg will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen, (anti-HBs and anti HBc IgG).The time between the removal of the HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the window period.A person negative for HBsAg but positive for anti-HBs has either cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously.Hepatitis B carriersIndividuals who remain HBsAg positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers.Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, as revealed by biopsy.Carriers who have seroconveed to HBeAg negative status, paicularly those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others.PCR testsThey have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens.These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment.Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.",B

The condition may have an acute onset due to isolated exposure or may be chronic due to repeated low-dose exposure. ETIOPATHOGENESIS. A list of impoant organic (biologic) dusts which may be inhaled to produce hypersensitivity pneumonitis is already given in. The immunologic mechanisms underlying hypersensitivity pneumonitis from any of these causes appear to be either type III immune-complex disease or type IV delayedhypersensitivity reaction. 1. Farmers' lung is the classic example resulting from exposure to thermophilic actinomycetes generated by humid and warm mouldy hay. 2. Bagassosis occurs in individuals engaged in manufacture of paper and cardboard from sugarcane bagasse. Spores of thermophilic actinomycetes grow rapidly in mouldy sugarcane bagasse which are inhaled. 3. Byssinosis is an occupational lung disease occurring in workers exposed to fibres of cotton, flex and hemp for a number of years. The role of immunologic mechanisms in byssinosis is not as clear as in exposure to other organic dusts. 4. Bird-breeders' (Bird-fanciers') lung occurs in pigeon breeders, parrot breeders, chicken farmers and bird-fanciers who are exposed to bird-droppings and danders from their feathers. 5. Mushroom-workers' lung is found in mushroom cultivators exposed to mushroom compost dust. 6. Malt-workers' lung is seen in distillery and brewery workers who are exposed to mouldy barley and malt dust. 7. Maple-bark disease occurs in those involved in stripping of maple bark and inhale mouldy maple bark (maple tree is grown in nohern hemisphere for timber and its leaf is the national emblem of Canada). 8. Silo-fillers' disease occurs in individuals who enter the silo (silo is an aiight store-house of fodder for farm animals) in which toxic fumes of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide are formed due to fermentation of silage. The condition is generally rapidly fatal; less often it may lead to ILD.",C

Cell injury occurs due to,Decreased cellular ATP generation,Cytosolic Ca++,Membrane damage,Intracellular K+,"Cell injury occurs due to decreased generation of cellular ATP ATP is necessary for Na+--K+ ATPase pump and Ca pump action and many other cellular functions for the existence of the cell THE MORPHOLOGY OF CELL AND TISSUE INJURY It is useful to describe the structural alterations that occur in damaged cells before we discuss the biochemical mecha- nisms that bring about these changes. All stresses and noxious influences exe their effects first at the molecular or biochemical level. Cellular function may be lost long before cell death occurs, and the morphologic changes of cell injury (or death) lag far behind both (Fig. 1-7). For example, myocardial cells become noncontractile after 1 to 2 minutes of isch- emia, although they do not die until 20 to 30 minutes of ischemia have elapsed. These myocytes may not appear dead by electron microscopy for 2 to 3 hours, or by light microscopy for 6 to 12 hours. The cellular derangements of reversible injury can be corrected, and if the injurious stimulus abates, the cell can return to normalcy. Persistent or excessive injury, however, causes cells to pass the nebulous 'point of no return' into irreversible injury and cell death. The events that determine when reversible injury becomes irreversible and progresses to cell death remain poorly understood. The clinical rele- vance of this question is obvious; if the biochemical and molecular changes that predict cell death can be identified with precision, it may be possible to devise strategies for preventing the transition from reversible to irreversible cell injury. Although there are no definitive morphologic or biochemical correlates of irreversibility, two phenomena con- sistently characterize irreversibility: the inability to correct mito- chondrial dysfunction (lack of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation) even after resolution of the original injury, and profound disturbances in membrane function. As mentioned earlier, injury to lysosomal membranes results in the enzymatic dissolution of the injured cell, which is the culmination of injury progressing to necrosis. As mentioned earlier, different injurious stimuli may induce death by necrosis or apoptosis (Fig. 1-6 and Table Refer robbins 9/e p6",A

These are consequence of anaemia or leucocytosis. Some patients may also present with signs of abnormal hemostatis such as bleeding gum. Peripherial smear shows pancytopenia? o The no. of Leukemic cells in peripheral blood in AML is highly variable sometimes being more than 10000 cell/ ml but being under 10,000 in 50% of patients. o Occasionally the peripheral smear may not contain any blasts (aleukemic leukemia). So even in pts with pancytopenia bone marrow examination is essential to exclude acute leukenia. Bone marrow examination reveals 26% blast/cells :? o Harrison says ? 'The diagnosis of AML is established by presence of more than 20% myeloblast in bone marrow.' The blast cells were mature and contain Auer rods: o Auer rods are red staining rod like structures (representing abnormal azurophilic granules) present in myeloblast in AML. The presence of Auer rods is considered as definite evidence of myeloid differentiation. They are most numerous in M3 form ofAML. Neutrophil with Pseudo Pelger Huet anomaly :? o Pseudo Pelger Huet cells are neutrophils with only 2 nuclear lobes and are frequently seen in myelodysplastic syndrome.

It binds to a different cytoplasmic immunophilin protein labelled 'FKBP', but the subsequent steps are the same, i.e. inhibition of helper T cells calcineurin. Tacrolimus is administered orally as well as by i.v. infusion. Oral absorption is variable and decreased by food. It is metabolized by CYP3A4 Section 14 and excreted in bile with a longer tlh of 12 hour. Therapeutic application, clinical efficacy as well as toxicity profile are similar to cyclosporine. It is paicularly valuable in liver transplantation because its absorption is not dependent on bile. Because ofmorepotentaction, itis also suitable for suppressing acute rejection that has set in. Hypeension, hirsutism and gum hyperplasia are less marked than cyclosporine, but tacrolimus is more likely to precipitate diabetes, cause neurotoxicity, alopecia and diarrhoea.

Wilson disease is due to accumulation of: September 2005,Copper,Iron,Zinc,Nickel,"Ans. A: Copper In Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and poal hypeension. On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia. About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of pa of the body). Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease: Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea. They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria.

Centriacinar (centrilobular) emphysema o Centriacinar emphysema is the most common type of emphysema seen clinically. o It is chracterized by involvement of respiratory bronchioles, i.e. central (proximal) pa of the acinus. o So, both emphysematous and normal airspaces exist within the same acinus and lobule. o The lesions are more common and more severe in the upper lobe, paicularly in the apical segments. o This is the type of emphysema that occurs predominantly in heavy smokers and usually coexists with chronic bronchitis. Panacinar (Panlobular) emphysema o The acini are uniformly enlarged from the level of the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli. o This type of emphysema tends to occur more commonly in the lower zones and in the anterior margins of the lung, and it is usually most severe at the base. o This type of emphysema is associated with al -antittypsin deficiency. Distal acinar (Paraseptal) emphysema o This type of emphysema involves distal pa of the acinus, while proximal pa is normal. o It is localized adjacent to the pleura, along perilobular septa. o The involvement is seen adjacent to areas of fibrosis, scarring, or atelectasis and is usually more severe in the upper half of lungs. o This type of emphysema is a common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults. 4.Irregular emphysema (Para-cicatricial emphysema) 3 The acinus is involved irregularly and is almost invariably associated with scarring. o It is the most common type of emphysema histologically.

It is true that sarcoma - a) Are malignant tumours of mesenchyme origin  b) Usualy spread by vascular invasion  c) Metastasise frequently to regional lymph node  d) Are only loosely invasive,ab,bc,cd,ac,"Pathways of metastasis 

Distant metastasis of cancers may occur through one of three pathways.

1.  Direct seeding of body cavities or surface

It occurs when a malignant neoplasm penetrates into a natural open field.
Most common cavity involved is peritoneal cavity, but other cavities may also be involved, e.g., pleural, pericardial, joint space, subarachnoid.
Such seeding is particularly characteristic of carcinomas arising in the ovaries.
Sometimes mucus secreting tumor of appendix (or less commonly ovary) fill the peritoneal cavity with a gelatinous neoplastic mass referred to as pseudomyxoma peritonei.

2.  Lymphatic spread

This is the most common method of metastasis for carcinomas.
Sarcoma may also use this route.
As tumors do not have lymphatics, this type of spread takes place through the lymphatic vessels located at the tumor margins.
The pattern of lymph node involvement follows the natural routes of lymphatic drainage.
The first node in a regional lymphatics that receives lymph flow from the primary tumor is called sentinel lymphnode.
Some times local lymph nodes may be bypassed because of venous lymphatic anastomosis skip metastasis.

3.  Hematogenous spread

It is typical of sarcomas but is also seen in carcinomas.
Veins are more commonly involved than arteries because veins have thinner walls that can be penetrated readily, in contrast arteries have thicker walls.
With venous invasion, the tumor cells in blood follow the venous flow draining the site of neoplasm.
So, liver and lung are the most frequent organs involved in hematogenous spread because all portal area drainage flows to the liver and all caval blood flows to the lung.
Arterial spread may occur when tumor cells pass through the pulmonary capillary beds or pulmonary A-V shunts or when pulmonary metastasis give rise to additional tumor emboli.",A

All are seen in malignant hypertension except -,Fibrinoid necrosis,Hyaline arteriolosclerosis,Necrotizing glomerulonephritis,Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis,"Malignant hypertension, defined as blood pressure usually
greater than 200/120 mm Hg, is far less common in the
United States than so-called “benign” hypertension and
occurs in only about 5% of persons with elevated blood
pressure. It may arise de novo (i.e., without preexisting
hypertension), or it may appear suddenly in a person who
had mild hypertension.
Pathogenesis
The basis for this turn for the worse in hypertensive subjects
is unclear, but the following sequence is suggested: The initial
event seems to be some form of vascular damage to the
kidneys. This most commonly results from long-standing
hypertension, with eventual injury to the arteriolar walls. The
result is increased permeability of the small vessels to fibrinogen
and other plasma proteins, endothelial injury, and platelet
deposition. This leads to the appearance of fibrinoid
necrosis of arterioles and small arteries and intravascular
thrombosis. Mitogenic factors from platelets (e.g., plateletderived
growth factor) and plasma cause intimal hyperplasia
of vessels, resulting in the hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis
typical of organizing injury of malignant hypertension and of
morphologically similar thrombotic microangiopathies (see
later) and further narrowing of the lumina. The kidneys
become markedly ischemic.",B

Which of the following cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of alveolar-capillary damage in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)?,CD4-positive lymphocytes,CD8-positive lymphocytes,Eosinophils,Neutrophils,"ARDS, pathologically referred to as diffuse alveolar damage, is a clinical syndrome of acute respiratory failure resulting from diffuse injury to the alveolar/capillary barrier. Such injury may be caused by a great variety of initiating insults, the most frequent of which are shock, severe trauma, sepsis, and gastric aspiration. All these different forms of injury result in recruitment of neutrophils within the alveolar capillaries. Neutrophils release chemokines that attract histiocytes and produce oxygen radicals, prostaglandins, and proteases that damage alveolar epithelium. Formation of hyaline membranes is due to a combination of plasma fluid extravasation and alveolar cell necrosis.CD4+ (helper) lymphocytes, CD8+ (cytotoxic) lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells have been implicated in a number of pulmonary diseases, but not in diffuse alveolar damage.

Type B gastritis -,Body predominant,Fundus predominant,Antral predominant,All,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Antral predominant Chronic atrophic gastritis o Chronic atrophic gastritis is a process of chronic inflammation of the stomach mucosa, leading to loss of gastric glandular cells and their eventual replacement by intestinal and fibrous tissue. o Chronic atrophic gastritis is classified according to the predominant site of involvement :? 1. Type 'A' gastritis o It refers to body - predominant form involving fundus and body with sparing of antrum. It is also called as autoimmune gastritis as the damage is due to autoimmunity. It is less common of the two forms of chronic atrophic gastritis. 2. Type 'B' gastritis It is called as antral predominant gastritis as antrum is involved predominantly. However, it is misnomer as the inflammatory process may progress to body and fundus and causing pangastritis. o H. pylori infection is the cause of type B gastritis. It is the most common cause of chronic gastritis and by for the most impoant etiological association with chronic gastritis is chronic infection with H. pylori.",C

Jumping gene is known as?,Transposon,Retroposon,Insertion sequence,Integron,"* Transposons, also called jumping genes, are pieces of DNA that move readily from one site to another.* They move either within or between the DNAs of bacteria, plasmids and bacteriophages in a manner, that plasmid genes can become part of the chromosomal complement of genes.* Interestingly, when transposons transfer to a new site, it is usually a copy of the transposon that moves, while the original remains in situ (like photocopying).* Transposons can code for metabolic or drug resistance enzymes and toxins. They may also cause mutations in the gene into which they insert or alter the expression of nearby genes.* In contrast to plasmids or bacterial viruses, transposons cannot replicate independently of the recipient DNA. More than one transposon can be located in the DNA for example, resistance genes. Thus, transposons can jump from:# The host genomic DNA to a plasmid# One plasmid to another# A plasmid to genomic DNA.* An insertion sequence is a short DNA sequence that acts as a simple transposable element. Insertion sequences have two major characteristics: they are small relative to other transposable elements (generally around 700 to 2500bp in length) and only code for proteins implicated in the transposition activity (they are thus different from other transposons, which also carry accessory genes such as antibiotic resistance genes.",A

"A 44 year old businessman presents to a physician because of a markedly inflamed and painful right great toe.He states that he just returned from a convention, and had noticed increasing pain in his right foot during his plane trip home. Physical examination is remarkable for swelling and erythema of the right great toe as well as small nodules on the patient's external ear. Aspiration of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the affected toe demonstrates needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals. Which of the following agents would provide the most immediate relief for this patient?",Allopurinol,Aspirin,Colchicine,Probenecid,"The patient has gout, which is due to precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in joint spaces (notably the great toe) and soft tissues (causing tophi, which are often found on the external ears). Colchicine reduces the inflammation caused by the urate crystals by inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis secondary to an effect on microtubule assembly. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that forms uric acid from hypoxanthine. Therapy with this agent should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Aspirin competes with uric acid for tubular secretion, thereby decreasing urinary urate excretion and raising serum uric acid levels. At high doses (more than 2 gm daily) aspirin is a uricosuric. Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are uricosuric agents, increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid, hence decreasing serum levels of the substance. Therapy with these agents should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Ref: Grosser T., Smyth E. (2011). Chapter 34.

Mitochondrial chromosomal abnormaity leads to -,Lebers hereditary optic neuropathy,Angelman syndrome,Prader villi syndrome,Myotonic dystrophy,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Lebers hereditary optic neuropathy o Diseases associated with mitochondrial inheritance are rare and many of them affect the neuromuscular system,o Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a prototype of this disorder. It is a neurodegenerative disease that manifests itself as progressive bilateral loss of central vision. Visual impairment is first noted between ages 15 and 35, and it leads to blindness. Cardiac conduction defects & minor neurologic manifestations have also been seen in some families.Mitochondrial diseaseso DMA in human may be found at two locationsNuclear DNA in the nucleusOrganelle DNA in the mitochondriao Mitocondrial DNA is the only non-chrontosomal DNA in human cells.o Mitochondrial DNA, is always maternally inherited. Why is it so, lets see :-Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are located in different places in the cell. During fertilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo. The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cells' nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embryo comes from the egg only. Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the mitochondria in the mothers egg.All children from affected mother will inherit the disease but it will not be transmittedfrom an affectedfather to his children.Clinical Syndromes of Mitochondrial DiseasesDisorderPrimary FeaturesAdditional FeaturesChronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)o External ophthalmoplegiao Bilateral ptosiso Mild proximal myopathyKearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS)o PEO onset before age 20 yearso Pigmentaiy retinopathyo One of the following CSF protein greater than 1 g/L, cerebellar ataxia, heart blocko Bilateral deafnesso Myopathyo Dysphagiao Diabetes mellituso Hypoparathyroidismo DementiaPearson syndromeo Sideroblastic anemia of childhoodo Panytopeniao Exocrine pancreatic failureo Renal tubular defectsInfantile myopathy and lactic acidosis (fetal and non-fataJ forms)o Hypotonia in the first year of lifeo Feeding and respiratory difficultieso Fatal form may be associated with a cardiomyopathy and/or the Toni-Fanconi-Debre syndromeLeigh syndroms (LS)o Subacute relapsing encephalopathyo Cerebellar and brain-stem signso Infantile onseto Basal ganglia lucencieso Maternal history of neurologic disease of Leigh syndromsNeurogenic weakness with ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP)o Late-childhood or adult-onset peripheral neuropathyo Ataxiao Pigmentary retinopathyo Basal ganglia lucencieso Abnormal eiectroretinogramo Sensorimotor neuropathyMitochondria] encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)o Stroke-like episodes before age 40 yearso Seizures and/or dementiao Ragged-red fibers and/or lactic acidosiso Diabetes mellituso Cardiomyopathy (initially hypertrophic: later dilated)o Bilateral deafnesso Pigmentary retinopathyo Cerebellar ataxiaMyoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF)o Myoclonuso Seizureso Cerebellar ataxiao Myopathyo Dementiao Optic atrophyo Bilateral deafnesso Peripheral neuropathyo Spasticityo Multiple lipomataLeber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)o Subacute painless bilateral visual failureo Males: females- 4:1o Median age of onset 24 yearso Dystoniao Cardiac pre-excitation syndromes",A

The classic example of this mechanism is the quinidine group of drugs. The Fc poion of the antibody molecule is not involved in the binding process. - Drug binds to Fc, and drug-antibody complex binds and activates platelets. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the classic example of this phenomenon. In HIT, the heparin-antibody-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex binds to Fc receptors on the surface of the platelet. Since Fc poion of the antibody is bound to the platelets, they are not available to the Fc receptors of the reticulo-endothelial cells, so therefore this system cannot destroy platelets as usual. This may explain why severe thrombocytopenia is not a common feature of HIT. -- Abciximab induced thrombocytopenia. Aspirin inhibits the release of ADP from platelets and their sticking to each other. However, it has no effect on platelet survival time and their adhesion to the damaged vessel wall.",B

Which of the following is a direct renin inhibitor?,Aliskrein,Losartan,Perindopril,Vernakalant,"Ref. GG I2!h edp.799 Explanation: Direct Renin Inhibitor DRIs are a novel class of antihypertensive drugs that inhibit the RAS at its origin. Angiotensinogen is the only specific substrate for renin, and its conversion to AngI presents a rate-limiting step for the generation of downstream components of the RAS. Aliskiren is a low-molecular-weight non-peptide that is a potent competitive inhibitor of renin. It binds the active site of renin to blocks the conversion of angiotensinogen to Ang I, thus reducing the consequent production of Ang II. Aliskiren has a 10.000-fold higher affinity to renin than to any other aspartic peptidases. The till is 20-45 hours. Plasma protein binding is 50% and is independent of concentration. Aliskiren is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp). which accounts for low absorption. Adverse Events- diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, cough (cough was much less common than with ACE inhibitors), elevated uric acid, renal stones, and gout. Like other RAS inhibitors, aliskiren is not recommended in pregnancy. Aliskiren reduces absorption of furosemide by 50%. Note: Vernakalant is an investigational multi-channel blocker that was developed for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Adverse effects of vernakalant include dysgeusia (disturbance of taste), sneezing, paresthesia, cough, and hypotension.",A

"A 68-year-old woman presents for a routine check-up. Her only complaint is that she occasionally experiences a little swelling in her ankles. Her serum potassium is 3.5 mEq/L, so the physician wants to avoid unnecessary potassium losses. Which of the following diuretics would be most appropriate for this patient?",Furosemide,Hydrochlorothiazide,Indapamide,Indapamide,"Potassium is responsible for maintenance of intracellular tonicity, transmission of nerve pulses, contraction of muscle (striated and smooth), and maintenance of renal function. The normal blood level of potassium ranges from 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L. In potassium depletion, a decrease in the blood potassium level by 1 mEq/L equals a loss of 100-200 mEq from potassium stores in the body. Depletion can result in the development of muscular weakness, paralysis, and mental confusion. Since this patient is borderline hypokalemic, she should receive a potassium-sparing diuretic, such as spironolactone, amiloride, or triamterene. These agents are all indicated for the treatment of edematous states as well as the prophylaxis and treatment of hypokalemia. These agents are commonly combined with other non-potassium-sparing diuretics to prevent the appearance of hypokalemia during therapy. Furosemide is a loop diuretic indicated for the treatment of edematous states in hypeension and is commonly associated with the development of hypokalemia. Hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, and metolazone are thiazide diuretics indicated for the treatment of edematous states in hypeension and are also commonly associated with the development of hypokalemia.",D

Histologically they can be differentiated by normal pituitary by : -


Cellular monomorphism → Adenoma contains single type of cells (e.g., Lactotroph or somatotroph).
Absence of reticulin network → Reticulin stain negative, while normal pituitary parenchyma is positive.


Corticotroph cell adenomas are PAS postive because of the presence of Carbohydrate in pre-opiomelanocorticotropin (POMC).
Hormone negative adenomas are called 'null cell adenoma'.

"Although more than 400 blood groups have been identified, the ABO blood group system remains the most important in clinical medicine because -",It was the first blood group system to be discovered -,"It has four different blood groups A,B, AB, O (H).",ABO(H) antigens are present in most body tissues and fluids,ABO(H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC lacks the corresponding antigen,"The basic difference between the ABO blood group system and other blood group systems (such as Rh, Kell, Duffy, MNSs blood groups), which makes the ABO group so important is that -

Preformed ABO antibodies (agglutinins) are present in person serum when his RBCs lack the corresponding antigen (ie. anti B antibody would be present in a person of type A and type O blood groups. These two blood groups do not have the 'B' antigen on the RBCs) 


This is not the case with other blood groups. Preformed antibodies are not present. They are formed only after an exposure to the antigen, for example, an Rh-negative person do not have anti- Rh antibodies, these antibodies are formed only after an exposure to Rh-positive blood (by a blood transfusion, i.e. this makes the first blood transfusion safe even if mismatched)
These preformed antibodies, rapidly destroy the RBCs of any mismatched blood transfusion.
Read the following lines from the Journal of hematology-
'In clinical transfusion practice, the ABO blood groups are the most important and can never be ignored in red cell transfusion, because individuals who genetically lack any antigen, have antibodies against the red cell types that they have not inherited. These antibodies can destroy red cells rapidly in circulation'.",D

Antianginal drugs Antianginal drugs such as calcium channel blockers or nitrates (GTN) should not be stopped before surgery without a very specific reason or angina may recur. Calcium channel blockers They have antiischaemic propey despite a theoretical risk of increased bleeding. They should be continued upto including the day of surgery. Nitrates To be continued up to and including day of surgery. About other classes of drugs Statins They should have a beneficial effect on outcome especially after coronary aery bypass grafting thus they are continued up to the day of surgery. Alpha 2 agonists Abrupt withdrawl an result in extreme hypeension and myocardial ischemia. So it should be continued upto and including the day of surgery. Diuretics There is risk of hypovolemia and hypotension but still should be continued up to the day of surgery. Digoxin and antiarryhthmics Should be continued upto the day of surgery. ACE inhibitors Continued use can result in perioperative hemodynamic instability For hypeension: continued to the day of surgery For hea failure: discontinue on the day of surgery especially if baseline blood pressure is low. Drugs that should be stopped before surgery Lithium It should be stopped 2 days before major surgery as it potentiates the non depolarizing group of relaxants and in emergency cases suxamethonium and regional blocks should be considered as alternative. Oestrogen containing oral contraceptive pills They are stopped before surgery beause they increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis. Surgery and the combined pill both reduce the activity of antithrombin Combined pills, should if possible be discontinued 4 weeks before major elective surgery or leg surgery such as varicose veins and staed again at the first period following an interval of 2 weeks after the operation. Aspirin Use may be associated with increased bleeding due to platelet dysfunction. They should be stopped 5-7 days before surgery if possible. Oral anticoagulants (warfarin) Should be stopped 4 days prior to surgery and substituted by iv heparin. Oral hypoglycemics Patients with type II diabetes mellitus should stop oral hypoglycemics several days prior to surgery (especially metformin which is known to contribute to postoperative lactic (acidosis) Patients on insulin (SC or iv) should omit their morning dose. Also know about these Monoamine oxidase inhibitors These drugs irreversibly inhibit monoamine oxidase. Stopping these drugs three weeks prior to anaesthesia to allow resynthesis of the enzyme is no longer considered necessary. Tricyclic antidepressants It competitively blocks norepinephrine reuptake by postganglionis sympathetic nerve endings. Patients taking these drugs are therefore more sensitive to catecholamines so any sympathominetic given simultaneously may cause hypeension and arryhthmia. These drugs were discontinued earlier but nowdays they are used.",C
