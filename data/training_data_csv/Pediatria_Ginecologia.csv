Median chain acyl Co A dehydrogenase deficiency is characterised by all except,Autosomal recessive inheritance,Hypoketotic hypoglycemia,Cardiomyopathy,Episodes associated with fasting,"Clinical characteristics : Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) is one of the enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid b-oxidation. Fatty acid b-oxidation fuels hepatic ketogenesis, which provides a major source of energy once hepatic glycogen stores become depleted during prolonged fasting and periods of higher energy demands. MCAD deficiency is the most common disorder of fatty acid b-oxidation and one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism. Most children are now diagnosed through newborn screening. Clinical symptoms in a previously apparently healthy child with MCAD deficiency include hypoketotic hypoglycemia and vomiting that may progress to lethargy, seizures, and coma triggered by a common illness. Hepatomegaly and liver disease are often present during an acute episode. Children appear normal at bih and - if not identified through newborn screening - typically present between age three and 24 months, although presentation even as late as adulthood is possible.

Which of the following is the main form of oestrogen secreted from the ovary?,Estradiol,Estrone,Estriol,All of the above,"The major estrogens produced by women are estradiol (estradiol-17, E2), estrone (E1), and estriol (E3). Estradiol is the major secretory product of the ovary. Although some estrone is produced in the ovary, most estrone and estriol are formed in the liver from estradiol or in peripheral tissues from androstenedione and other androgens. During the first pa of the menstrual cycle estrogens are produced in the ovarian follicle by the theca and granulosa cells. After ovulation, the estrogens as well as progesterone are synthesized by the luteinized granulosa and theca cells of the corpus luteum, and the pathways of biosynthesis are slightly different.

A neonate has ABO incompatibility. Peripheral smear will showaEUR',Microspherocytes,Elliptocytes,Fragmented RBCs,Polychromophilia,"Microspherocytes ABO incompatibilityis usually a mild hemolytic disease that causes mild to moderate anemia. Ilemolysis associated with ABO incompatibility exclusively occurs in type '0' mothers with fetuses who have type A or type B blood. - The naturally occurring antibodies in ABO blood group (A, B, AB) is of the 'IgM class' and it cannot cross the placenta. - As compared with the other ABO blood groups that have predo- minantly IgM antibodies group 0 mothers also have significant amount of naturally occurring 'IgG antibody'. -These IgG antibodies can easily cross the placenta and produce hemolysis in,fetus. ABO incompatibility usually causes mild hemolysis and anemia. The lack of severity of hemolytic disease can be attributed to the following factors. - There is wide expression of A and B antigens not only on red cells but also in plasma and other cells which will paially neutralize maternally derived ABO antibodies. - In addition, fetal RBC's are not .fully developed in the infant and they express less number of A and B antigenic sites, hence the low incidence of significant hemolysis in affected neonates. Therefore in ABO incompatibility, hyperbilirubinemia is the predo- minaret manifestation of incompatibility (rather than anemia). The peripheral blood picture in these patients show Micro.spherocytesQ Reticulocytosis Polychromasia (not as characteristically seen as in other hemolytic anemias) Microspherocytes Spherocytes are associated with allt0i117177Une hemolytic anemias as the cell membrane of antibody coated RBC is lost .following interaction of RBC's with splenic macrophages. The slow. .flow of blood through the spleen provides an ample oppounity for the macrophage to come in contact with coated RBC's. The macrophages subsequently removes a poion of the RBC membrane and release the RBC in the spherocy- tic form with a typically decreased surface area to volume ratio. Note : Microspherocytes are characteristically seen in of ABO incompati- bility but in the other hemolytic disease of the newborn, i.e. erythroblastosis fetalis, they are characteristically absent. Polychromasia Polychromasia can be seen in ABO incompatibility but is not characteristic as in any other hemolytic anemia Polychromasia refers to variation in erythrocyte coloration - This variation is largely related to be maturation of the erythrocytes - The younger form owing to the presence of nucleus or RNA, stains blue, with Romanowsky stains where as mature forms due to the absence of nuclear material will stain uniformly orange pink. - Polychromasia is usually seen when RBC is released prematurely from the bone 111(1i-row to compensate for the blood loss. They are usually associated with hemolysis - In these conditions there is an increased erythroid response from the bone marrow - Immature RBC's or reticulocytes move into the circulation from the bone marrow. These RBC's have nucleus (if they are upto normoblast stage, or RNA's (as in reticulocytes) - These immature BBC's stain blue with Romanowsky stains.

Which enzyme deficiency causes hemolytic anemia-,G-6-PD,Aldolase,Isomerase,Enolase,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., G-6-PD Glucose 6 phosphate dehvdrogenase (G6PD) deficiency o Normally, RBCs are protected from oxidant injury by reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione is generated from oxidized glutathione and the reducing equielent for this reaction is provided by NADPH. o This NADPH is generated in HMP shunt by enzyme Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, while oxidizing glucose6-phosphate. o If G6PD is deficient, NADPH production will be reduced that results in increased susceptibility of RBC to oxidative damage because of unavailability of reduced glutathione. So, whenever there is oxidant stress, e.g. by drugs, infection or foods, hemolysis occurs. G6PD deficiency causes episodic intravascular and extravascular hemolysis.

Mentoposterior: Before going on to mentoposterior, lets see mentoanterior.
Mentoanterior
​Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 390
In mentoanterior face presentation there is place for spontaneous vaginal delivery and liberal episiotomy is all that is required. In case of delay, forceps delivery is done.
In mentoposterior: 20 to 30% cases rotate anteriorly through 3/8 of circle and deliver as mento anterior, there fore trial of labour may be given in hope of anterior rotation of chin, followed by spontaneous/forceps delivery. In the rest 70-80%, incomplete anterior rotation/ non rotation occurs.
In these persistent mentoposterior: cesarean section is the only management. Therefore in mentoposterior per se forceps is not applied, only when it rotates anteriorly and becomes mentoanterior, forceps are applied.
Option ‘b’
Deep transverse arrest
Management options in case of deep transverse arrest are:
Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 372
Ventouse: Ideal for all cases
Cesarean section: If the pelvis is android or there is CPD, cesarean section should be done. In modern obstetrics, traumatic vaginal delivery causing intracranial hemorrhage is to be avoided at all costs and so there is increasing use of cesarean section for deep transverse arrest.
Other options are:

Manual rotation followed by outlet forceps application.
Forceps rotation and delivery using Keilland forceps.
Craniotomy if the baby is dead.

"A 7 year old child presents with non productive cough, mild stridor since 6 months. On oral antibiotics, patient is improving but suddenly develops wheezing, productive cough, mild fever. X–ray shows hyperlucency and PFT shows obstructive curve. Most probable diagnosis is –",Post viral syndrome,Bronchiolitis obliterans,Follicular bronchitis,Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis,"Bronchiolitis obliterans

Bronchiolitis obliterans. is a rare chronic lung disease of the bronchioles and smaller airways
Bronchiolitis obliterans most commonly occurs in pediatric population after respiratory infections (i.e. adenovirus, mycoplasma, measles, influenza, pertussis).
Other causes include connective tissue disease (i.e. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma)
Bronchiolitis occurs in all age groups.


Pathogenesis

After the initial insult, inflammation affecting terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts may result in obliteration of the airway lumen.
Epithelial damage resulting in abnormal repair is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans.
Complete or partial obstruction of the airway lumen may result in air trapping or atelactasis.

Clinical manifestations

Cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans.
Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing.
Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyperluscency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a swyer James syndrome, i.e. a unilateral hyperluscent lung has developed).
Pulmonary function tests demonstrate varaible findings but typically shows signs of airway obstruction.
Ventilation perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion.
CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyperluscency.
Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans.

Treatment

No definite therapy exists for bionchiolitis obliterans.
Administration of corticosteroids may be beneficial

About other options
Follicular bronchitis

It is a lyinphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles)
It is rare in children.
Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed.
Onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months.
Cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings.
Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common.
Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern.
Pulmonary function tests show restrictive pattern
Chest CT shows fine reticular pattern.
Open lung biopsy is used to make definitive diagnosis.


Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis


This is a rare disorder.
Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or 'inicrolith', within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph.
Chest radiography typically reveal bilateral infiltrates with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance.
Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid 30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood.
When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exertion and non productive cough.
Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign.
Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation.
Diagnosis
Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or 'Sandstorm' appearance.
CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities.
Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alceoli.",B

First investigation done for abnormal uterine bleeding in reproductive age group is _______,Ultrasonography transabdominal,Pap smear,Urine Beta HCG,Ultrasonography transvaginal,"The first investigation for abnormal uterine bleeding is Urine Beta HCG to rule ouut pregnancy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding(AUB): is a common and debilitating condition. Chronic AUB was defined as &;bleeding from the uterine corpus that is abnormal in volume, regularity and/or timing that has been present for the majority of the last 6 months. AUB may affect females of all ages. Factors that influence incidence most greatly are age and reproductive status. A structured approach for establishing the cause using the FIGO PALM COEIN classification system will facilitate accurate diagnosis and inform treatment options. In the reproductive age group , the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis matures, and anovulatory uterine bleeding is encountered less often. The diagnostic goal is exclusion of pregnancy and identification of the underlying pathology to allow optimal treatment. Miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and hydatidiform moles may cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Pregnancy complications are quickly excluded with determination of urine and serum Beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG levels). This is typically obtained on all reproductive-aged women. Other options: Pap smear evaluation is usually done for cervical and endometrial cancers which are commonly seen in peri and post menopausal women. Transvaginal sonography (TVS) typically offers greater patient comfo and suitable detection of postmenopausal endometrial hyperplasia and cancer compared to transabdominal ultrasonography.

A Hysterosalpingogram was performed for infertility evaluation and revealed the appearance shown here. The diagnosis is?,Septate uterus,Bicornuate uterus,Unicornuate uterus,Arcuate uterus,"Ans. B. Bicornuate uterusMullerian duct anomalies are an often-treatable cause of infertility. Mullerian duct anomalies are estimated to occur in 0.1-0.5% of women. However, the true prevalence is unknown because the anomalies usually are discovered in patients presenting with infertility. Full-term pregnancies have occurred in patients with forms of bicornuate, septate, or didelphys uteri; therefore, true prevalence may be slightly higher than currently estimated. An association exists between mullerian duct anomalies and renal anomalies such as unilateral agenesis.The bicornuate uterus results from incomplete fusion of the uterovaginal horns at the level of the fundus and accounts for approximately 10% OF mullerian duct anomalies. Patients with a bicornuate uterus and no extrauterine infertility issues usually have little difficulty conceiving. A bicornuate uterus consists of two symmetric cornua that are fused caudally, with communication of the endometrial cavities--most often at the level of the uterine isthmus. The intervening cleft of the complete bicornuate uterus extends to the internal cervical os (bicornuate unicollis), while the cleft of a partial bicornuate configuration is of variable length. A bicornuate bicollis uterus is associated with a duplicated cervix, although a degree of communication is maintained between the two horns. The bicornuate uterus has been reported to have the highest associated prevalence--38%--of cervical incompetence among mullerian duct anomalies.",B

The presence of increased levels of which of the following in amniotic fluid is an indicator of open neural tube defect in the fetus?,Phosphatidylesterase,Acetyl cholinesterase,Pseudocholineesterase,Butyrylcholineesterase,"Acetylcholinesterase Presence of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the amniotic fluid is seen in cases of fetal open neural tube defects (NTD). It has got a better diagnostic value than AFP. Acetylcholinesterase (AchE) a neural enzyme is present in cerebral spinal fluid and fetal blood. AChE is not normally detectable in amniotic fluid. AChE in amniotic fluid can also be seen in cases of ventral wall defect, fetal demise (including demise of a co-twin) and massive fetal blood contamination. When AChE is detected, the ratio of AChE to pseudocholinesterase (PChE), a non-specific cholinesterase normally found in amniotic fluid, may help distinguish open neural tube defects from open ventral wall defects. The levels of AChE are higher in open NTD than ventral wall defects. Ratio greater than 0.15 - open spna bifida Ratio less than 0.10 - ventral wall defect",B
Fetal heart starts contracting at,10-12 days,10-12 weeks,3-5 weeks,3- 5 month,"(C) 3-5 weeks[?]The Beginning:The human heart begins to beat and pump blood through the embryo around day 22 of gestation.The electric stimulus that triggers contractions in the myocardium arise spontaneously within the myocardium itself, and propagate from cell to cell. Input from the central nervous system can modify the heart rate (the frequency of heart beats), but it does not initiate beats.The ability of cardiac myocytes to beat is an intrinsic property of these cells. It has been found that myocytes removed from the early heart and grown in culture will beat sporadically, and if they become connected to each other, will then begin to beat rhythmically, in unison.As a functional organ, the heart begins to beat very early, even before it has assumed its final form.Interestingly, the heart begins to beat even before structures such as valves and septa (singular: septum; the muscular walls that divide the chambers) have formed. The initial contractions are peristaltic - that is, they proceed in a wave like fashion along the length of the heart.

William Obstetrics, 21st ed., 45, Langman's embryology 23)A graafian follicle is 20-23 mm in size.Ovarian Follicles As the primary oocyte begins to grow, surrounding follicular cells change from flat to cuboidal and proliferate to produce a stratified epithelium of granulosa cells, and the unit is called a primary follicle.|As development continues, fluid-filled spaces appear between granulosa cells. Coalescence of these spaces forms the antrum, and the follicle is termed a secondary (vesicular, Graafian) follicle.|Initially, the antrum is crescent shaped, but with time, it enlarges. Granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte remain intact and form the cumulus oophorus. At maturity, the secondary follicle may be 25 mm or more in diameter. It is surrounded by the theca interna.|With each ovarian cycle, a number of follicles begin to develop, but usually only one reaches full maturity. The others degenerate and become atretic. When the secondary follicle is mature, a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) induces thepreovulatory growth phase.|Meiosis 1 is completed, resulting in formation of two daughter cells of unequal size, each with 23 doublestructured chromosomes. One cell, the secondary oocyte, receives most of the cytoplasm; the other, the first polar body, receives practically none.|Meiosis II is completed only if the oocyte is fertilized; otherwise, the cell degenerates approximately 24 hours after ovulation.",B

'Conduplicato corpore' indicates spontaneous_____,Version,Rectification,Evolution,Expulsion,"Ans. d (Expulsion) (Ref. Williams Obstetrics 22nd/Ch. 20)If the fetus is small--usually less than 800 g--and the pelvis is large, spontaneous delivery is possible despite persistence of the abnormal lie. The fetus is compressed with the head forced against the abdomen. A portion of the thoracic wall below the shoulder thus becomes the most dependent part, appearing at the vulva. The head and thorax then pass through the pelvic cavity at the same time, and the fetus, which is doubled upon itself, sometimes referred to as conduplicato corpore, is expelled.TRANSVERSE LIE# The long axis of the fetus is approximately perpendicular to that of the mother. When the long axis forms an acute angle, an oblique lie results. The latter is usually only transitory, because either a longitudinal or transverse lie commonly results when labor supervenes. For this reason, the oblique lie is called an unstable lie.# In transverse lies, the shoulder is usually over the pelvic inlet, with the head lying in one iliac fossa and the breech in the other. In such a shoulder presentation, the side of the mother on which the acromion rests determines the designation of the lie as right or left acromial. Moreover, because in either position the back may be directed anteriorly or posteriorly, superiorly or inferiorly, it is customary to distinguish varieties as dorsoanterior and dorsoposterior.Diagnosis# The diagnosis usually is made easily, often by inspection alone.# On vaginal examination, in the early stages of labor, the side of the thorax, if it can be reached, may be recognized by the 'gridiron' feel of the ribs. When dilatation is further advanced, the scapula and the clavicle are distinguished on opposite sides of the thorax. The position of axilla indicates the side of the mother toward which shoulder is directed.Etiology# Abdominal wall relaxation from high parity.# Preterm fetus.# Placenta previa.# Abnormal uterine anatomy.# Excessive amnionic fluid.# Contracted pelvis.Mechanism of Labor# Spontaneous delivery of a fully developed newborn is impossible with a persistent transverse lie. After rupture of the membranes, if labor continues, the fetal shoulder is forced into the pelvis, and the corresponding arm frequently prolapses. After some descent, the shoulder is arrested by the margins of the pelvic inlet, with the head in one iliac fossa and the breech in the other. As labor continues, the shoulder is impacted firmly in the upper part of the pelvis. The uterus then contracts vigorously in an unsuccessful attempt to overcome the obstacle. With time, a retraction ring rises increasingly higher and becomes more marked. The situation is referred to as a neglected transverse lie. If not promptly managed, the uterus eventually ruptures, placing the mother and fetus at grave risk. Even with the best of care, morbidity is T because of the frequent association with placenta previa, the T likelihood of cord prolapse, and the necessity for major operative efforts.Management# In general, the onset of active labor in a woman with a transverse lie is an indication for cesarean delivery. Once labor is well established, attempts at conversion to a longitudinal lie by abdominal manipulation will likely not be successful. Before labor or early in labor, with the membranes intact, attempts at external version are worthy of a trial in the absence of other complications that indicate cesarean delivery. If during early labor, the fetal head can be maneuvered by abdominal manipulation into the pelvis, it should be held there during the next contractions in an attempt to fix the head in the pelvis. If these measures fail, cesarean delivery is performed.# Because neither the feet nor the head of the fetus occupies the lower uterine segment, a low transverse incision into the uterus may lead to difficulty in extraction of a fetus entrapped in the body of the uterus above the level of incision. Therefore, a vertical incision is likely to be indicated.",D
"A 5-year-old girl without past history of UTI is in the hospital on antibiotics for E coli pyelonephritis. She is still febrile after 4 days of appropriate antibiotics.

"Eye blinking or throat-clearing noises in an otherwise healthy 8-year-old boy. For the description above, select the most likely diagnosis.",Transient tic disorder of childhood,Tourette syndrome,Sydenham chorea,Dystonia,"Tics are commonly seen in a pediatric practice. All have in common the nonrhythmic, spasmodic, involuntary, stereotypical behaviors that involve any muscle group. Transient tic disorder is the most common and is seen more often in boys; a family history is often noted. In this condition, the patient has eye blinking, facial movements, or throat clearing lasting for weeks to about a year. No medications are needed. Chronic motor tics persist throughout life and can incorporate motor movements involving up to three muscle groups.Gilles de la Tourette syndrome is a lifelong condition that is characterized by motor and vocal tics, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and a high incidence of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADDH). Therapy for the ADDH is helpful, as is medication to control the motor or vocal tics. Multiple psychosocial problems exist with these children; a multidisciplinary approach is helpful.Dystonic reactions are sometimes seen in patients receiving phenothiazine medications. They have unusual neck, arm, or leg muscle twitches that are sometimes confused with seizure activity. Diphenhydramine, infused intravenously, usually rapidly reverses this relatively common idiosyncratic drug reaction.Cerebral palsy is a static condition of movement and posture disorders frequently associated with epilepsy and abnormalities of vision, speech, and intellect. A defect in the developing brain is felt to be the cause. No significant change in the incidence of cerebral palsy has been noted in the past few decades despite drastically improved obstetric and neonatal care. No treatment for cerebral palsy is available; a multidisciplinary approach to manage the many medical problems associated with the condition is helpful.The term 'chorea' describes involuntary uncoordinated jerks of the arms and legs. Sydenham chorea is the most common acquired chorea of childhood, is seen after infections with group A b-hemolytic streptococci, and is associated with rheumatic heart disease and arthritis. In addition to the motor symptoms, patients may be hypotonic, emotionally labile, and have a 'milkmaid' grip with sequential grip tightening and relaxing. Other findings include a darting tongue and 'spooning' of an extended hand (flexion at the wrist and extension of the fingers).",A

Early onset GBS is seen in the first 7 days of life and is associated with maternal complications such as prolonged rupture and chorioamnionitis; late onset GBS occurs after 7 days of life and is not related to maternal issues but rather environmental exposures. As expected, the incidence of early onset GBS has been steadily dropping with maternal prophylaxis; the incidence of late onset GBS and listeriosis has remained unchanged during the same time period.

In moderate or mild cases of metabolic acidosis i.e., when the pH is > 7.2 metabolic acidosis needs no specific t/t. T/T of the underlying cause is sufficient.(it will correct the acidosis) Once the underlying cause (here tissue perfusion) is corrected the pH will return to normal But when the pH is < 7.2 specific bicarbonate therapy is warranted because this degree of acidosis may depress cardiac contractility. According to Harrison 'In general severe acidosis (pH < 7.20) warrant the intravenous administration of 50-100 meq of NaHCO3 over 30-45 minutes during the initial, 1 to 2 hours of therapy'. So here, besides fluid administration to correct tissue perfusion, HCO3 transfusion is also required because pH is 7. The question is which complication should be first attended to, peripheral circulatory failure or severe metabolic acidosis. Harrison states: 'The underlying condition that disrupts lactate metabolism must first be corrected, tissue perfusion must be restored when it is inadequate'.",B

All of the following therapies may be required in a 1-hour-old infant with severe bih asphyxia except-,Glucose,Dexamethasone,Calcium gluconate,Normal saline,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Dexamethasone Coicosteroids should not be used' - Paediatrics for doctors - Frankshann & John Vince Management Protocol The management protocol of babies with asphyxia : Oxygen. In the absence of continuous oxygen saturation monitoring, it is reasonable to give nasopharyngeal oxygen (0.5 litre/min) until the baby recovers. If monitoring is available, oxygen is given as appropriate. Thermal control. Baby's body temperature should be kept in the normal range of 36.5-37.2degC (sometimes the babies become hyperpyrexic). Correction of shock, If peripheral perfusion is poor, it is reasonable to give 20 ml/kg of normal saline initially. If perfusion remains poor, the use of dopamine should be considered. Fluid balance. Give IV fluids at 2/3 maintenance. Use 10% dextrose. Monitor blood glucose with dextrostix and do not let it fall below 2.2 mmol (explains glucose administration) Prevent/control convulsions. In less severely affected babies, phenobarbitone should be given when there is anyuspicion of actual or impending convulsions (phenobarbitone loading dose 20 mg/kg IM or 10mg/kg slowly IV, then 5 mg/kg daily orally). Treat hvpocaleaemia if it occurs (or more practically, if the baby has uncontrollable fitting with anormal dextrostix). (explains calcium gluconate administration) Notes I. Coicosteroids should not be used, and although many paediatricians use mannitol, there is no evidence for its effectiveness. 2. Babies with severe asphyxia may appear to settle relatively quickly after the resuscitation - but there is likely to be a deterioration after 6-12 hours or so as cerebral oedema develops.",B

A finger introduced upto the internal os and if found open pass it a little beyond and withdraw the finger. While withdrawing feel for the sphincter - like tone of the internal os; if the os tends to close down with sphincter like or snapping action, the os is considered competent and no cerclage is necessary. This is a highly subjective test.3) Cervical sonography:# Funelling of the cervix with changes in the form of Y, V, U.# Cervical length < 2.5 cm.# Funnelling of the internal os > 1 cm# Speculum examination: Detection of dilatation of internal os with herniation of the membranes.# Cervical index = (Funnel length + 1) / (endocervical length).# The '+1' allows an index to be calculated when funelling is absent.o Predictors of preterm birth:# Cervical index >0.52.# Cervical length < 18 mm# Funnel length > 9 mm.# Funnel width > 6 mm.o Diagnosis in non - pregnant state:1) Passage without resistance and pain of No. 8 Hegarrs dilator.2) Cervicogram : shows funnel shaped cervix.3) Intracervical balloon studies: Pass a balloon (e.g. Foley's) into cervical canal and inflate it with a radio - opaque dye and then take x - rays after applying due traction. Pear shaped shadow of balloon due to funneling of cervical canal indicates incompetent os.4) Traction studies : Pass foley's catheter through internal os of cervix and inflate it with 5 - 10 ml and apply traction. If traction of 600 gm or less is enough to pull out the bulb through the os, then the diagnosis is certain.5) Bromen papaine test : This dye selectively dilates the cervico - uterine junction.

The incidence increases as maternal age increases. The classic features are hypotonia, upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, excess nuchal skin, an enlarged tongue, clinodactyly of the fifth fingers, and a single transverse palmar crease. Edwards syndrome or trisomy 18, has features of small palpebral fissures, low-set ears, low bih weight, microcephaly, rocker-bottom feet, cleft lip, hypotonia, and clenched hands. Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by growth retardation, small palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, a thin upper lip, microcephaly, and a sho nose. Features often go unnoticed in the newborn period, although sometimes tremulousness and irritability occur. Marfan syndrome is associated with increased stature, thin limbs, scoliosis, joint hypermobility, and ocular manifestations. Features often go unnoticed in the newborn period.

Macrocytic anemias include folate deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency; however, folate deficiency is more commonly seen in pregnancy than vitamin B12 deficiency. Iron deficiency is a microcytic anemia (MCV below normal), and it is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy. Physiologic anemia of pregnancy is a result of the physiologic hemodilution that occurs in the vasculature. There is a dispropoionate increase in plasma volume over the increased RBC volume, and this 'diluted state' also gives the appearance of a fall in the laboratory values of hemoglobin and hematocrit.",C

Best treatment for severe stress incontinence without prolapse is,Pelvic floor exercise,Kelly's repair,Burch colposuspension,Tension free (Transvaginal) tape,"Students, Please read this: From Novaks Gynecology 15th edition Comparing various surgeries for the treatment of stress incontinence, Numerous panels and studies conducted in the late 90's concluded that colposuspension (e.g., Burch, Marshall- Marchetti-Krantz ) and slings were more effective than transvaginal needle suspensions or anterior repairs for long-term success (48-month cure/dry rates).... Now, there were many journals which came out with the information that the TVT/TOT are now better, but since it never came in a book, it was actually never asked of you for the last 5-6 years Now, the 2020 Novaks gynecology 16th writes this: Over the past two decades, there has been an accumulation of a large body of evidence on mid-urethral slings from randomized controlled trials, including several meta-analyses and Cochrane reviews . The overarching summary is that mid-urethral slings have become the procedure of choice in treating women with stress urinary incontinence. They have a good safety profile with a significant improvement of QOL measures, and irrespective of route of placement, they are highly effective in the sho, medium, and long term. There is evidence to suggest that the mid-urethral slings are more effective than the Burch colposuspension procedure, and as effective as the autologous pubovaginal sling ...

During acute flare-ups, the skin of the distal phalanx becomes red and scaly and develops small pustules. The pustules often join together and on bursting, reveal a painful, red and glazed area where new pustules then develop. Pustulation of the nail bed and its growth site (matrix) can result in onychodystrophy (malformation) and anonychia (loss of nail). Slowly, the disease can rarely spread proximally to affect the hand, forearm and/or foot. There may be osteolysis (destruction of bone) resulting in a wasted and tapered tip of finger or toe.

'--Goodman and Gilman 12/e p736'ACE inhibitors not only block the conversion of ANG I to ANG II but also inhibit the degradation of other substances, including bradykinin, substance P, and enkephalins. The action of ACE inhibitors to inhibit bradykinin metabolism contributes significantly to their hypotensive action and is apparently responsible for some adverse side effects, including cough and angioedema. These drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy because they cause fetal kidney damage.

A 30 week gestation mother delivered 1.2 mg baby with moderate respiratory distress. RR 70/min with grunting and chest retraction. Most logical next step is aEUR',Warm humidified oxygen hood,Nasal CPAP,Surfactant and mechanical ventilation,Mechanical ventilation,"CPAP The symptoms suggest neonatal respiratory distress syndrome / hyaline membrane disease. Respiratory distress syndrome / hyaline membrane disease occur because of inadequate production of surfactant. Since surfactant deficiency is the basis of RDS, exogenous surfactant is now recommended as the treatment of choice in neonates with RDS. - It is given to all neonates less than 28 weeks irrespective of presence or absence of RDS (Rescue treatment). -Beyond this age surfactant therapy is given according to the clinical condition of the patient. - If the distress is severe surfactant is required. - In the question the neonate is 32 weeks old and presents with moderate respiratory distress. - Surfactant is not necessary in such patient. Remember 'Surfactant is not universally indicated in all cases of respiratory distress syndrome'. Management of Respiratory distress syndrome Management of respiratory distress syndrome begins with admi-nistration of warm humidified oxygen. - This should maintain the aerial levels between 50 and 70 mm Hg (85-95% saturation) to maintain normal tissue oxygenation. If Pa02 cannot be maintained above 50 mm Hg at inspired 02 concentration of 60% or greater CPAP should be applied. - If the patient is VLBW (very low bih weight) then CPAP is used early (t/t begins with CPAP instead of oxygen). - Another approach in VLBW infant is to intuhate the infant, administer intracheal surfactant, then extubutate the patient and put him on CPAP. (In the question the infant is 1.5 kg at 32 weeks, his weight, for age is adequate). Infants with severe RDS require mechanical ventilation. According to Indian Journal of pediatrics Early cPAP in respiratory distress syndrome It is impoant to note that cPAP helps mainly by preventing the alveolar collapse in infants with surfactant deficiency. Once atelactasis and collapse have occurred cPAP might not help much. - Therefore all preterm infants < 35 weeks with any sign of respiratory distress should be staed immediately on cPAP. Prophylactic cPAP Extending the above logic some have advocated the use of prophylactic cPAP before the onset of respiratory distress in preterm VLBW infants as majority of them would eventually develop respiratory distress. However there is no evidence for any additional benefits with this approach, indeed there are concerns regarding increased adverse effect such as intraventricular hemorrhage. 'Hence prophylactic cPAP is not recommended at present'. Beneficial effects of cPAP Increase in functional residual capacity Increased pulmonary compliance Prevents alveolar collapse Increases airway diameter Conserves surfactant Decrease in alveolar aerial 02 pressure gradiant. More on cPAP Continuous positive airway pressure is a modality in which increased pulmonary pressure is provided during the expiratory phase of respiration in spontaneously breathing neonates. The mechanism by which CPAP produces its beneficial effects includes:? - Increased alveolar recruitment and stability - Redistribution of lung vvater This results in improved V/Q matching The administration of CPAP :? - Decreases oxygen requirements - Decreased need for mechanical ventilation and - Reduces moality and duration of respiratory assistance Indications of CPAP Inadequate aerial blood gas values - Inability to maintain a Pa02 greater than 50 mmHg with Fi02 .60. cPAP is initiated in newborns with RDS when Pa02 is approximately less than 50 mmHg on a Fi02 of .40. Abnormalities on physical examination - the presence of increased work of breathing as indicated by an increase in respiratory rate of >30% of normal, substernal and suprasternal retractions grunting and nasal flaring, the presence of pale or cyanotic skin colour and agitation. In treatment of RDS in both term and preterm infants. Prolonged and recurrent apneic attacks of prematurity. The presence of poorly expanded and / or infiltrated lung fields on chest radiograph. The presence of a condition thought to be responsive to CPAP and associated with one or more of the clinical presentation described above. - Respiratory distress syndrome - Pulmonary edema - Atelactasis - Apnea of prematurity - Recent extubation - Tracheal malacia or other similar abnormality of the lower airways - Transient tachyapnea of the newborn",B

Most probable diagnosis is",Kawasaki disease,Paially treated meningitis,IMN,Type 3 hypersensitivity,"Type 3 hypersensitivity Immunologically mediated adverse drug been reactions have AND classified according to the GELL COOMBS CLASSIFICATION. The 4 types are: Immediate hypersensitivity - It occurs when the drug or drug metabolite interacts with preformed drug specific IgE antibodies that are bound to the surfaces of tissue mast cells and/or circulating basophils. Clinically manifests with uicaria, bronchospasm and anaphylaxis Cytotoxic reactions - Involve IgG or IgM antibodies that recognize drug antigen on cell membrane. In the presence of serum complement, the antibody coated cell is either cleared by the monocytes or macrophage system or is destroyed. Examples include drug induced hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia. Immune complex reactions (Type /I hypersensitivity) - It is caused by soluble complexes of drug or metabolite in slight antigen excess with IgG or IgM antibodies. The immune complex is deposited in blood vessel walls and causes injury by activating the complement cascade as seen in serum sickness. Clinical manifestations include fever, uicaria, rash, lymphadenopathy, and ahralgias. Symptoms typically appear 1-3 weeks after the last dose of an offending drug and subside when the drug and/or its metabolites are cleared from the body. Delayed hypersensitivity - These are mediated by drug specific T lymphocytes. Commonly implicated drugs include neomycin and local anesthetics in topical formulations.

Asherman's syndrome can be diagnosed by all except,Hysterosalpingography,Saline sonography,Endometrial culture,Hysteroscopy,"Endometrial culture IRef. Williams 22/e p 236 and Shaw's 13'/e p 470] Asherman's syndrome It is an acquired uterine defect. It is characterized by the presence of uterine synechiaes. Uterine synechiaes are bandlike structures between the walls of the uterus causing minimal to almost complete obliteration of the uterine cavity. Histologically these bands are made up of, fibrous tissue, myometrium and endometrium. The synechiaes usually results from destruction of large areas of endometrium by some surgical procedure (currettage). Uterine synechais are associated with early pregnancy loss. (The remaining endometriwn is insufficient to suppo the pregnancy, and aboion may ensue). Transvaginal and abdominal ultrasound are of limited use in the diagnosis and evaluation of intrauterine adhesions. On the contrary saline infusion sonography and three dimensional ultrasound provide some specific information on location and extent of adhesions. Diagnosis The diagnosis of Asherman's syndrome is usually made by hysterosalpingogram it shows characteristic multiple filling defect. Hysteroscopy is the most accurate procedure to diagnose Asherman's syndrome. Treatment of Asherman's syndrome Lysis of the band hysteroscopy. Placement of an intrauterine device to avoid contact between the ends of the adhesions. Treatment with estrogen to stimulate endometrial growth.",C
The requirement of which nutrient cannot be compensated by dietary intake in pregnancy,Iron,Protein,Carbohydrate,Fats,"(Iron) (121 -Shaw's 15th)Adequate energy intake and a diversified diet that includes fruit,vegetables, and animal products throughout the life cycle help ensure that women enter pregnancy and lactation without dcficienciesand obtain adequate nutrients during periods of heightened dcmand.Some nutrient requirements, particularly iron, folic acid, and vitaminA, aremore difficult to achieve than others through food sources.For this reason, supplements with these nutrients are recommendedin addition to improved diets. Fortified foods should be promotedthrough counseling and social marketing in countries where foodsfortified with iron, iodine, folic acid, or vitamin A are available andaffordable.IRON* In the absence of Iron supplementation, there is drop in hemoglobin serum iron, and serum ferritin concentration at term pregnancy thus pregnancy is an inevitable iron deficiency state* Daily iron requirement in non menstruating women to compensate the overage daliy loss is 1 mg. Thus in the second help, the daily requirement, actually becomes very much increased to the extent of about 6-7 mg* Total iron requirement during pregnancy is estimated approximately 1000 mg* The fall in the hemoglobin concentration during pregnancy is due to combined effect of hemodilution and negative iron balance* Folic acid supplementation beginning 1 month before conception to about 12 weeks of pregnancy has reduced the incidence of neural tube defects signilicantly A dose of 4 mg daily is recommended* Folic acid deficient most commonly seen in a pregnant mother who is on phenytoin therapy for epilepsy",A

The doses should be adjusted to achieve the manufacturer's peak anti-Xa level 4 hours after subcutaneous injection Adjusted-dose UFH administered every 12 hours throughout pregnancy. The doses should be adjusted to keep the midinterval aPTT at least twice control or attain an anti-Xa level of 0.35 to 0.70 U/mL LMWH or UFH as above until 13 weeks' gestation, then warfarin substitution until close to delivery when LMWH or UFH is resumed In women at very high risk of thromboembolism and in whom concerns exist about the efficacy and safety of LMWH or UFH as dosed above warfarin treatment is suggested throughout pregnancy with replacement by UFH or LMWH (as above) close to delivery. In addition, low-dose aspirin--75 to 100 mg daily--should be orally administered If delivery supervenes while the anticoagulant is still effective, and extensive bleeding is encountered, then protamine sulfate is given intravenously Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin and heparin may be restaed 6 hours following vaginal delivery and heparin stopped once INR is adjusted between 2 and 3 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2011b) advises resuming unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin 6 to 12 hours after cesarean delivery Because warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and unfractionated heparin do not accumulate in breast milk, they do not induce an anticoagulant effect in the infant safe in breast feeding.

In patient with Rheumatic heart disease the mitral valve alone is involved in 65% to 70% cases, followed by Aortic valve in 25% cases.
The valvular deformity becomes manifested when Rheumatic fever becomes chronic.
Chronic Rheumatic heart disese is characterized by organization of the acute inflammation and subsequent fibrosis.
In particular, the valvular leaflets becomes thickened and retracted causing permanent deformity.
The cardinal anatomical changes which are produced to chronicity are leaflet thickening. commissuralfizsion and shortening and thickening and fusion of the tendinous cords.
These abnormalities lead to the most serious complication of Rheumatic fever i.e., Valvular stenosis and /or regurgitation.

"During a regular check-up of an 8-year-old child, you note a loud first heart sound with a fixed and widely split-second heart sound at the upper left sternal border that does not change with respirations. The patient is otherwise active and healthy. Which of the following heart lesions most likely explains these findings?",Atrial septal defect (ASD),Ventricular septal defect (VSD),Isolated tricuspid regurgitation,Tetralogy of Fallot,"Most children with an ASD are asymptomatic; the lesion is found during a routine examination. In older children, exercise intolerance can be noted if the lesion is of significant size. On examination, the pulses are normal, a right ventricular systolic lift at the left sternal border is palpable, and a fixed splitting of the second heart sound is audible. For lesser degrees of ASD, surgical treatment is controversial.VSD commonly presents as a harsh or blowing holosystolic murmur best heard along the left lower sternum, often with radiation throughout the precordium. The auscultatory finding of tricuspid regurgitation is typically a blowing holosystolic murmur, augmented during inspiration, and best heard at the left lower sternal border; a middiastolic rumble may also be heard. A history of birth asphyxia or findings of other cardiac lesions may be present. Tetralogy of Fallot is a common form of congenital heart disease. The four abnormalities include right ventricular outflow obstruction, VSD, dextroposition of the aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy; the cyanosis presents in infants and in young children. Mitral valve prolapse occurs with the billowing into the atria of one or both mitral valve leaflets at the end of systole. It is a congenital abnormality that frequently manifests only during adolescence or later. It is more common in girls than in boys and seems to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. On clinical examination, an apical murmur is noted late in systole, which can be preceded by a midsystolic click. The diagnosis is confirmed with an echocardiogram that shows prolapse of the mitral leaflets during mid to late systole.",A

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Preeclampsia,Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia,Eclampsia,Gestational hypertension,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Gestational hypertension * Hypertension in pregnancy is defined as blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or greater on at least two separate occasions that are 6 h or more apart. The presence of edema is no longer used as a diagnostic criterion because it is so prevalent in normal pregnant women. A rise in systolic blood pressure of 30 mmHg and a rise in diastolic blood pressure of 15 mmHg are also no longer used.* In gestational hypertension, maternal blood pressure reaches 140/90 or greater for the first time during pregnancy, and proteinuria is not present. In preeclampsia, blood pressure increases to 140/90 after 20 weeks of gestation and proteinuria is present (300 mg in 24 h or 1+ protein or greater on dipstick). Eclampsia is present when women with preeclampsia develop seizures.* Chronic hypertension is defined as BP >140/90 mmHg before pregnancy or diagnosed before 20 weeks of gestation, or hypertension first diagnosed after 20 weeks of gestation and persistent after 12 weeks postpartum.* A woman with hypertension who develops preeclampsia is described as having chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia.",D
Best investigation to establish the diagnosis of endometriosis is,Laparoscopy,USG,X-ray pelvis,CT Scan,"Ans. is a i.e. Laparoscopy Diagnostic laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis.

Other non typical findings could be : - Red implantsdeg - Serous or clear vesicles White plaques / scarring] - Yellowish brown discolouration of peritoneumdeg Sub ovarian adhesionsdeg. Histological confirmation of laparoscopic impression is essential for diagnosis of endometriosis. Danazol By its multiple effects, produces a high androgen & low estrogen environment that does not suppo the growth of endometriosis. It inhibits pituitary gonadotropins & produces pseudo menopause like state. Danazol is not more effective than other available medications to treat endometriosis. Due to its androgenic propey has significant side effect like weight gain, fluid retention, acne oily skin, hirsutism, hot flashes, atrophic vaginitis, reduced breast-size. reduced libido, fatigue, muscle cramps. Deepening of voice is an rreversible side effect. Gestrinone It is a 19 noesto sterone derivative. It acts centrally & peripherally to increase free testosterone, reduce SHBG. serum estradiol & LH which inturn obliterates LH & FSH surge. Its actions are similar to Danazol but is longer acting. So, can be given twice weekly. Side effects - similar to Danazol but less intense. Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist When given continously suppress pituitary gonadotropin. They are inactive orally; & have to be given intramuscular, intra nasal or subcutaneous. Side effects due to hypo estrogen are hot-flashes, vaginal dryness, reduced libido and osteoporosis.

These lesion can extend 1 Omm or more down from the peritoneal surface and the deeper lesions appear to have a closer associations with pain than infeility, whereas less deep lesions have a closer association with infeility than pain.' Dysmenorehea : ... Williams Gyane. 1/e, p 230 'Cyclical pain with menstruation is noted commonly in women with endometriosis. Typically. endometriosis associated dysmenorrhea preceedes menses by 24 to 48 hours and is less responsive to NSAID and combination oral contraceptives. This pain is thought to be more severe in comparison with primary dysmenorrhea and Crammer and associates demonstrated a positive correlation between the severity of dysmenorrhea and the risk of endometriosis. Fuhermore, deeply infiltrating endometriosis, that is disease that extends > 5 mm under the peritoneal surface, also appears to have positive correlation to the severity of dysmenorrhea.' From above lines it is clear that pain in endometriosis coincides with the depth of lesion. As far as other options are concerned ?

Gilbert syndrome true is -,Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia,Starvation improves the condition,Phenobarbitone improves the condition,Life threatening,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Phenobarbitone improves the condition* Gilbert syndrome is a milder form of hyperbilirubinemia caused by a reduced activity of UDP-glucuronyl transferase. It is caused by mutation of UGT1A1 gene.* UDP glucuronyl transferase is involved in conjugating bilirubin to form bilirubin diglucuronide. Hence it presents as unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.* Total bilirubin is mildly increased. But the ratio of unconjugated to conjugated bilirubin is high.* It presents as a milder form of jaundice. It is not life threatening* Starvation and stress are found to cause aggravation of the milder jaundice* If jaundice is disturbing, treatment can be tried with enzyme inducers like phenobarbitone. Phenobarbitone induces UDP glucuronyl transferase and helps in the reduction of bilirubin levels.* As some drugs also get metabolised by UDP glucuronyl transferase, detection of this condition is of clinical significance. For example, an antineoplastic drug, irinotecan is metabolised by UDP glucuronyl transferase. Hence in Gilbert's syndrome, Irinotecan has to be avoided. As UDP glucuronyl transferase defect increases the half-life of Irinotecan, it results in life threatening neutropenia.",C

In adults, the episodes of hypertension are more paroxysmal than in children, where the hypertension is more sustained. While it is an unusual diagnosis in children, pheochromocytoma must be considered in the evaluation of a patient with hypertension who has intermittent symptoms described. Pheochromocytoma can be associated with tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, and it can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.All of the other answers are possibilities in an adolescent-age child, but the concurrent finding of hypertension suggests an alternative diagnosis. Pregnancy would be unusual because of her age, but the diagnosis must be considered for practically all complaints in an adolescent of childbearing age. Brain tumors or migraine headache would be unlikely to produce the cardiac finding of 'racing heart' reported in this child. Diabetes can produce a variety of findings, but important clues missing from this case include frequency of urination, weight loss, and other classically seen symptoms.

"If zygote divides between 4-8 days post feilization, following twinning occurs",Dichorionic Diamniotic,Monochorionic Diamniotic,Monochorionic Monoamniotic,Conjoined twins,"The outcome of the monozygotic twinning process depends on when division occurs.At 0 to 4 days postfeilization, an early conceptus may divide into two. Division at this early stage creates two chorions and two amnions (dichorionic, diamniotic). Placentas may be separate or fused. Division between 4 to 8 days leads to formation of a blastocyst with two separate embryoblast (inner cell masses). Each embryoblast will form its own amnion within a shared chorion (monochorionic, diamniotic).Between 8 and 12 days, the amnion and amnionic cavity from above the germinal disc.

The greatest risk associated with hyperbilirubinemia is the development of kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) at high indirect serum bilirubin levels. The level of serum bilirubin associated with kernicterus is dependent in pa on the cause of the jaundice. Kernicterus has developed when bilirubin levels exceed 30 mg/dL, although the range is wide (21-50 mg/dL). Its onset is usually in the 1st wk of life, but it may_be delayed to the 2nd-3rd wk. Kernicterus develops at lower bilirubin levels in preterm infants and in the presence of asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage, hemolysis, or drugs that displace bilirubin from albumin. The exact serum bilirubin level that is harmful for VLBW infants is unclear. Kernicterus does occur in patients with breast milk jaundice but is very uncommon. The surface of the brain is usually pale yellow. On cutting, ceain regions are characteristically stained yellow by unconjugated bilirubin Ove neurologic signs have a grave prognosis; 75% or more of such infants die, and 80% of affected survivors have bilateral choreoathetosis with involuntary muscle spasms.

True about neuroblastoma:a) Tumor of autonomic nervous systemb) Metastasis rarely presentc) Earliest detected in late childhoodd)  Most common site is Adrenal medulla,b,c,ac,ad,"Neuroblastoma is a malignant tumor of the autonomic nervous system. It is a neuroendocrine tumor, arising from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system.
Neuroblastoma is a disease of early childhood with approximately 90% of patients presenting before 5-years of age and almost 50% within the first 2-years of life.
In childhood, about 40% of neuroblastomas arise in the adrenal medullae. The remainder occurs anywhere along the sympathetic chain, with the most common locations being the paravertebral region of the abdomen (25%) and posterior mediastinum (15%). Tumors may arise in numerous other sites, including the pelvis and neck and within the brain (cerebral neuroblastomas).
It is the second most common solid malignancy of childhood.
In young children, under age 2 years, neuroblastomas generally present with large abdominal masses, fever, and possibly weight loss. In older children, they may not come to attention until metastases produce manifestations, such as hone pain, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints.
Neuroblastomas may metastasize widely (Present in 60-70%- O.P. Ghai 7th/5990) through the hematogenous and lymphatic systems, particularly to liver, lungs, and bones, in addition to the bone marrow.
Proptosis and ecchymosis may also be present because the periorbital region is a common metastatic site. Bladder and bowel dysfunction may be caused by paraspinal neuroblastomas that impinge on nerves.
In neonates, disseminated neuroblastomas may present with multiple cutaneous metastases with deep blue discolora­tion to the skin (earning the rather unfortunate designation of 'blueberry muffin baby)'
About 90% of neuroblastomas, regardless of location, produce catecholamines (similar to the catecholamines associ­ated with pheochromocytomas), which are an important diagnostic feature (i.e., elevated blood levels of catecholamines and elevated urine levels of metabolites, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and homovanillic acid (HVA)
Children older than age 5 years usually have extremely poor outcomes irrespective of the stage (Robbins 7th/500-503)

Defined by the presence of virilizing signs in girls. Select the type of sexual precocity with which it is most likely to be associated (SELECT 1 PRECOCITY),True sexual precocity,Incomplete sexual precocity,Isosexual precocious pseudopuberty,Heterosexual precocious pseudopuberty,"True sexual precocity in girls is characterized by normal gonadotropin levels (as opposed to expected low prepubertal gonadotropin levels) and a normal ovulatory pattern. It represents premature activation of a normally operating hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Although it is usually idiopathic, true sexual precocity can arise from cerebral causes such as tumors or a history of encephalitis or meningitis, as well as from hypothyroidism, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, neurofibromatosis, and other disorders. In girls who have precocious pseudo puberty, the endocrine glands, usually under neoplastic influences, produce elevated amounts of estrogens (isosexual precocious pseudo puberty) or androgens (heterosexual precocious pseudo puberty). Ovarian tumors appear to be the most common cause of isosexual precocious pseudo puberty; some ovarian tumors, including dysgerminomas and choriocarcinomas, can produce so much gonadotropin that pregnancy tests are positive. Incomplete sexual precocity, which is usually idiopathic, is characterized by only partial sexual maturity, such as premature thelarche or premature adrenarche (pubarche). Incomplete sexual precocity can be accompanied by abnormal function of the central nervous system (e.g., mental deficiency). Gonadotropin levels are frequently normal in these patients. In gonadotropin-producing tumors, high levels of gonadotropins such as FSH are produced with subsequent production of estrogen. Examples of these rare tumors are hepatoma, chorioepithelioma, and presacral tumors.",D

Milk ejection is due to which hormone -,Oxytocin,Progesterone,Estrogen,Prolactin,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Oxytocin Physiology of Lactation* 500-800 ml of milk is produced by a healthy mother per day which requires 700 kcal/day.* Physiological basis consists of 4 phases:1. Mammogenesis : Growth of both ductal and lobuloalveolar systems occurs in pregnancy2. Lactogenesis : Colostrum secretion is noted during pregnancy and immediately post delivery. Milk secretion starts around the third postpartum day. Despite high prolactin levels in pregnancy, milk is not secreted as the high levels of estrogen and progesterone make the breast tissue unresponsive. With withdrawal of estrogen and progesterone levels post delivery, prolactin acts on the breast tissue. Growth hormone, thyroxine and insulin also increase secretory activity.3. Galactokinesis: Milk is discharged due to the infant's suckling efforts and also a contractile mechanism which expresses milk from the alveoli into the ducts. Oxytocin is a major galactokinetic hormone.# Milk ejection reflex: Reflex by which milk is forced down into the ampulla of the lactiferous duct, where it can be sucked out by the baby.4. Galactopoeisis : The most important hormone is prolactin. Suckling is essential for effective and continuous lactation. Periodic feeding is essential to relieve the pressure which then maintains the secretion.",A

Cell fusion of Fanconi cells with normal cells or with cells from unrelated patients with Fanconi anemia produces a corrective effect on chromosomal fragility, a process called complementation. No other constitutional pancytopenia is associated with an abnormal chromosomal breakage study.0 The average age at diagnosis is 8 years.# The most common anomaly is Hyperpigmentation of the trunk, neck, and intertriginous areas, as well as cafe-au-lait spots and vitiligo, alone or in combination. Other associated deformities include microcephaly, microphthalmia, short stature, horseshoe kidneys and absent thumbs (not triphalangeal thumbs).# The most frequent solid tumors are carcinomas of the head, neck, and upper esophagus, followed by carcinomas of the vulva and/or anus and lower esophagus.# Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative therapy for the hematologic abnormalities.

Sickle cell anemia is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy, i.e. the type of disease characterized by the production of defective hemoglobin.

Normal hemoglobin

The hemoglobin molecule is an assembly of four globular protein.
Each subunit is composed of a protein part, i.e, globin and a nonprotein part, i.e. heme, i.e. Each hemoglobin molecule contain four heme units and two pairs of a similar protein, globin.
The heme part of the globular protein is same in all types of hemoglobin.
The protein part vary in different hemoglobin -


Adult hemoglobin (Hemoglobin A) consists of two identical α-chains and two identical δ-chains.
Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) consists of two identical a-chains and two identical γ chains.
Minor hemoglobin (HbA,) consists of two identical a-chains and two identical δ chains.


Normally adult blood contains about 96% of HbA (α2 β2) 3-3.5% HbA2(α2 δ2), and small amount of fetal hemoglobin HbF (α2 γ2).

Defect in sickle cell anemia 

Sickle cell anemia results from a mutation in β-globin gene.
It is caused by a point mutation at the sixth position of the β-globin chain leading to a substation of a valine residue for a glutamic acid residue. resulting in sickle hemoglobin (HbS).
Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder.
If an individual is homozygous for the sickle cell mutation, almost all the hemoglobin in the red cell is HbS.
In heterozygotes, only about 40% of the hemoglobin is HbS, the remainder being normal hemoglobins.",B

The primary diagnostic steps in the workup of the infertile couple include (1) documentation of ovulation by measurement of basal body temperature (BBT) or mid-luteal phase serum progesterone; (2) semen analysis; (3) postcoital test; (4) hysterosalpingogram; and (5) endometrial biopsy. Women should record their BBT for evidence of ovulation. In addition, serial serum progesterone levels may be helpful to confirm ovulation. Serum progesterone values should be obtained 7 days after ovulation and may also be helpful in evaluating inadequate luteal phase. An endometrial biopsy may also provide valuable information regarding the status of the luteal phase. The biopsy is obtained 12 days after the thermogenic shift, or 2 to 3 days before the expected onset of menses, on about day 26 of a 28-day cycle. A postcoital test is an in vivo test that evaluates the interaction of sperm and cervical mucus. It is performed during the periovulatory period up to 12 h after coitus. The cervical mucus is obtained, and its quantity and quality as well as its interaction with the sperm are evaluated. The hysterosalpingogram is performed in the mid follicular phase in order to evaluate the fallopian tubes and the contour of the uterine cavity; it should not be done while the patient is menstruating or after ovulation has occurred. Although gonadotropin levels are not routinely evaluated, they should be obtained in the early follicular phase when testing is indicated, e.g., in cases where there is a history of oligoovulation.",D

Best treatment for enuresis is __________,Oxybutinin,Desmopressin,Bed alarm,Imipramine,"Enuresis Defined as normal, complete evacuation of the bladder at a wrong place and time at least twice a month after 5 year of age. More than 85% children attain complete diurnal and nocturnal control by 5 years of age. Enuresis is primary when the child has never been dry and secondary when bed wetting stas after a minimum period of six months of dryness at night. It is said to be monosymptomatic if not accompanied by any lower urinary tract infection and nocturnal if it occurs during sleep. It has to be differentiated from continuous or intermittent incontinence or dribbling.The bed is usually soaking wet in enuresis, compared to incontinence in which there is loss of urine without normal emptying of bladder. ETIOLOGY:- 1. Maturation delay is most likely cause. 2. Anxiety producing episodes during the 2 nd to 5 th years, the time for development of nocturnal bladder control, are associated with increased risk of enuresis. 3. Lack of circadian rhythm of ADH or impaired response of kidneys to ADH. 4. Secondary enuresis can be precipitated by acute stressful condition or traumatic experience. Bladder irritability due to urinary tract infection or severe constipation with the full rectum impinging on the bladder can cause enuresis. 5. Conditions causing polyuria, spina bifida, ectopic ureter and giggle and stress incontinence are other causes. Treatment:- General advice given to all enurectic children but active treatment need not begin before 6 years of age. Caffeinated drinks like tea , coffee, sodas should be avoided in evening. Adequate fluid intake during day as 40% in morning, 40% in afternoon and 20% in evening is recommended. First line of treatment is usually non pharmacological, comprising motivational therapy and use of alarm devices. Motivational therapy:- Successful in curing enuresis upto 25%. The child is reassured and provided emotional suppo.Every attempt is made to remove any feeling of guilt. The child is encouraged to assume active responsibility, including keeping a dry night diary, voiding urine before going to bed, and changing wet clothes and bedding. Dry nights should be credited with praise.punishments and angry parenteral response should be avoided. Child is encouraged both to void frequently enough to avoid urgency and daytime incontinence and to have daily bowel movement. Alarm therapy: Involves the use of device to elicit a conditioned response of awakening to the sensation of full bladder. Best used after seven years of age. Successful in two third cases without much recurrence. The alarm device consists of a small sensor attached to child&;s underwear or a mat under the bed sheet and an alarm attached to the childs collar or at bedside. When the child stas wetting, sensors are activated thus causing the alarm to ring. Pharmacotherapy:- Used if enuresis persists despite alarm therapy, regular voiding habits, exclusion or treatment of constipation, exclusion of post voidal residual urine. Imipramine works by aleing the arousal sleep mechanism. It gives satisfactory initial response at dise of 1-2.5 mg/ kg/ day. Relapse rate after discontinuation of therapy seen. Cardiac arrythmia is a serious adverse effect. Anticholinergic drugs reduce uninhibited bladder contractions and are useful in children who have significant daytime urge incontinence besides nocturnal enuresis. Usual dose is 5 mg for oxybutynin, 2 mg for tolterodine. Desmopressin works by reducing volume of urine. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",C

Feilization of a secondary oocyte by a spermatozoan usually occurs in the,Cervical canal,Uterine cavity,Uterine poion of the uterine tube,Ampulla of the uterine tube,"After the secondary oocyte is released from the ovary, it is captured by the fimbriae of the uterine tube. In the uterine tube, the oocyte enters the funnel-shaped infundibulum, reaches the abdominal ostium, and passes through the ampulla. Here, a spermatozoan typically feilizes the oocyte. The feilized ovum or the unfeilized secondary oocyte then moves through the narrow isthmus of the uterine tube to reach the intramural or uterine poion of the tube (that pan of the tube that is within the wall of the uterus). After the feilized ovum enters the uterus, it implants in the uterine wall. By this time, the embryo has developed into the blastocyst stage. If passage of the feilized ovum through the uterine tube is restricted, implantation into the tubal wall may occur.",D

Option ‘a’: Always asociated with raised uterine size for gestational age.
This statement is incorrect as :
“The size of the uterus is more than that expected for the period of amenorrhea in 70%, corresponds with the period of amenorrhea in 20% and smaller than the period of amenorrhea in 10%.”
Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 193
Option ‘b’: Raised hCG - H. mole is characterised by raised levels of hCG (levels > 105 MIU/ml)
Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 193
Option ‘c’: Hysterectomy in selected cases :
Management of H.mole :

TOC in H. mole – Suction evacuation followed by gentle but thorough currettage.
Hysterectomy – It is indicated only in case of :

                                  – Female has completed her family

Hysterotomy – Indicated in cases complicated by haemorrhage.

In contrast, the recipient becomes polycythemic and may develop circulatory overload manifest as hydrops.The donor twin is pale, and its recipient sibling is Plethoric.Diagnosed based on two criteria: (1) presence of a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy, and (2) hydramnios defined if the largest veical pocket is >8 cm in one twin and oligohydramnios defined if the largest veical pocket is < 2 cm in the other twin.Once identified, TTTS is typically staged by the Quintero staging system:Stage I--discordant amnionic fluid volumes, but urine is still visible sonographically within the bladder of the donor twin.Stage II--criteria of stage I, but urine is not visible within the donor bladder.Stage III--criteria of stage II and abnormal Doppler studies of the umbilical aery, ductus venosus, or umbilical vein.Stage IV--ascites or frank hydrops in either twin.Stage V--demise of either fetus. Management and Prognosis: is related to Quintero stage and gestational age at presentationSeveral therapies are currently used for TTTS, including amnioreduction, laser ablation of vascular anastomoses, selective feticide, and septostomy (intentional creation of a communication in the dividing amniotic membrane).Reference: William's Obstetrics; 25th edition; Chapter 45; Multifetal pregnancy",B
Which is not an indication for a classical cesarean incision?,Cannot visualize the lower uterine segment,Transverse lie,Premature breech,Term breech (frank),"Ans. D. Term breech (frank)Occasionally it is necessary to use a classical incision for delivery. Some indications are:a. Difficulty in exposing or safely entering the lower uterine segment because the bladder is densely adherent from previous surgery, a myoma occupies the lower uterine segment, or the cervix has been invaded by cancer.b. Transverse lie of a large fetus, especially if the membranes are ruptured and the shoulder is impacted in the birth canal. A fetus presenting as a back-down transverse lie may be particularly difficult to deliver through a transverse incision.c. Some cases of placenta previa with anterior implantation, especially in the case where the placenta has grown through a prior uterine incision (placenta percreta).d. Certain cases in which the fetus is very small, especially if breech, and the lower uterine segment is not thinned out.e. Massive maternal obesity precluding safe to the lower uterine segment.",D

"A teenage girl complained about increased growth of facial hair. Her menstrual cycle is regular and she has normal body weight. Following may be used in treatment of hirsutism, EXCEPT:",Spironolactone,Flutamide,Cyproterone,Mifepristone,"Mifepristone does not used for hirsutism. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist. It possesses anti androgenic propeies and exes its peripheral antiandrogenic effects in the hair follicle by competing for androgenic receptors and displacing dihydrotestosterone at both nuclear and cytosol receptors. Flutamide is a potent, highly specific, nonsteroidal antiandrogen with no intrinsic hormonal or anti gonadotropic activity. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, it competitively inhibits target tissue androgen receptor sites. Cyproterone acetate is the an androgen receptor antagonist. Antiandrogenic effects result from competitive displacement of dihydrotestosterone from its receptor and reduction of 5-reductase activity in the skin.

Her temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 160/110 mm Hg, pulse is 88/minute, and respirations are 12/minute. Examination shows that her cervix is 2 centimeters dilated and 75% effaced, and that she is contracting every 2 minutes. The fetal hea tracing is in the 140s and reactive. Urinalysis shows 3+ proteinuria. Laboratory values are as follows: leukocytes 9,400/mm3, hematocrit 35%, platelets 101,000/mm3. Aspaate aminotransferase (AST) is 200 U/L, and ALT 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",Administer oxytocin,Discharge the patient,Encourage ambulation,Sta magnesium sulfate,"This patient has severe preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is diagnosed on the basis of hypeension, edema, and proteinuria. Severe preeclampsia may be diagnosed when the patient has one of the following: a headache that does not respond to analgesics, visual changes, seizure, very elevated blood pressures, pulmonary edema, elevated liver function tests, severe proteinuria, oliguria, an elevated creatinine, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, intrauterine growth restriction, or oligohydramnios. The management of severe preeclampsia after 32 weeks is with delivery. Prior to 32 weeks, consideration may be given to expectant management of the patient depending on the clinical circumstances. This patient is at 35 weeks' with headache, visual changes, elevated blood pressures, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver function tests. She, therefore, needs to be delivered. She appears to already be in labor as she is contracting every two minutes and her cervix is dilated and effaced. At this point, magnesium sulfate should be staed. Magnesium sulfate has consistently been demonstrated to be the most effective medication for seizure prophylaxis in women with preeclampsia. To administer oxytocin would not be necessary for this patient. She appears to already be in labor with contractions every two minutes. To discharge the patient would absolutely be incorrect. Severe preeclampsia need to be delivered or, at the very least, admitted to the hospital. There is no role for discharging a patient home in the management of severe preeclampsia. To encourage ambulation would also be incorrect. Severe preeclampsia should be kept on bed rest. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 34.

Which type of shift in intracranial content is common in children with progressive hydrocephalus,Transforaminal herniatation,Upward cerebellar herniation,Unilateral transtentorial herniation,Central transtentorial herniation,"Hydrocephalus is a condition in which the primary characteristic is excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This excessive accumulation results in an abnormal dilation of the spaces in the brain called ventricles. Increased pressure in the posterior fossa forces the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. These will compress the lower pa of the brain stem and upper cervical cord, resulting in life-threatening consequences. It usually occurs along with ascending or descending transtentorial herniation. (1) CINGULATE (SUBFALCINE) HERNIATION under falx cerebri. (2) CENTRAL (DOWNWARD TRANSTENTORIAL) HERNIATION through tentorial notch. (3) UNCAL (LATERAL MASS) HERNIATION over edge of tentorium.

It is described as unexpected difficulty in reading,that is, unexpected in relation to intelligence, chronological age/grade level, education, or professional statusIn typical readers, development of reading and IQ are dynamically linked over time, but in dyslexic readers, there is a developmental uncoupling between reading and IQ Dyslexia is both familial and heritable. Dyslexia is observed in 50% of children who have a parent with dyslexia; 50% of the siblings of dyslexiapersons; and 50% of the parents of dyslexics.Most commonly, language and/or auditory processing weaknesses are present as evidenced by poor phonologic processing. Challenges with phonologic processing often result in deficiencies at the level of decoding individual words and, consequently, a delay in automaticity (e.g., acquiring a repeoire of words they can identify instantly) that causes reading to be slow, laborious, and frustrating. Without effective identification and intervention, reading comprehension, and ultimately the acquisition of knowledge may be seriously compromised.Reference: Nelson Textbook of Paediatrics; 20th edition; Chapter 34; Dyslexia",A

Decreased ovulation / impaired ovulation casued by :,Minipill (prgesterone only pill),IUCD,Norplant,All,"Ans.is D.)All i.e: Minipill (progesterone only pill); IUCD; and Norplant Norplant offers long-term contraception through the use of subdermal capsules filled with levonorgestrel. The six capsules are implanted in the inside pa of the upper arm. The levonorgestrel is released from the capsules gradually, providing contraception for about 5 years. The primary mechanism of action of Norplant is suppression of ovulation. IUCDs primarily work by preventing feilization.The progestogen released from the hormonal IUDs may prevent ovulation from occurring but only paially.The hormone also thickens the cervical mucus so that sperm cannot reach the fallopian tubes. Copper IUDs contain no hormones, but the copper ions in the cervical mucus are toxic to sperm. They also cause the uterus and fallopian tubes to produce a fluid that contains white blood cells, copper ions, enzymes, and prostaglandins, a combination that is also toxic to sperm. Mechanism of Action of Mini pill(Progesterone Containing pill):Progestin-only oral contraceptives - Mechanisms of action include (1) suppression of ovulation; (2) a variable dampening effect on the midcycle peaks of LH and FSH; (3) an increase in cervical mucus viscosity; (4) a reduction in the number and size of endometrial glands; and (5) a reduction in cilia motility in the fallopian tube",D

Down's syndrome 

Down's syndrome is due to trisomy 21.
Down's syndrome is the most common trisomy.
In this condition, extra genetic material causes a delay in the way a child develops and often leads to mental retardation.
In Down's syndrome the child gets on the extra chromosome, he has a total of 47 chromosomes instead of 46 chromosomes.
This is the extra genetic material that causes the physical and cognitive delays associated with Down's syndrome.
There is a well-recognized association with advanced maternal age, the risk considerably increases in women > 35 years of age.

The risk of endometrial carcinoma is highest with the following histological pattern of endometrial hyperplasia: March 2007,Simple hyperplasia with atypia,Simple hyperplasia without atypia,Complex hyperplasia with atypia,Complex hyperplasia without atypia,"Ans. C: Complex hyperplasia with atypia Simple hyperplasia progresses to cancer in 10-20% whereas atypical hyperplasia is a precursor of cancer in 60-70% of cases. Classification Most endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas Endometrial carcinomas can be classified into two pathogenetic groups: Type I: These cancers occur most commonly in pre- and peri-menopausal women, often with a history of unopposed estrogen exposure and/or endometrial hyperplasia. They are often minimally invasive into the underlying uterine wall, are of the low-grade endometrioid type, and carry a good prognosis. Type II: These cancers occur in older, post-menopausal women, and are not associated with increased exposure to estrogen. They are typically of the high-grade endometrioid, papillary serous or clear cell types, and carry a generally poor prognosis Risk factors High levels of estrogen Endometrial hyperplasia Polycystic ovary syndrome Nulliparity Infeility Early menarche Late menopause Endometrial polyps or other benign growths of the uterine lining Tamoxifen Hyperplasia Pelvic radiation therapy Breast cancer Ovarian cancer Clinical evaluation A Pap smear may be either normal or show abnormal cellular changes. Endometrial curettage is the traditional diagnostic method. If endometrial curettage does not yield sufficient diagnostic material, a dilation and curettage (D and C) is necessary for diagnosing the cancer. Endometrial biopsy or aspiration may assist the diagnosis. Transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal Pathology The most common finding is a well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which is composed of numerous, small, crowded glands with varying degrees of nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and stratification. Fuher evaluation Colonoscopy is recommended due to the etiologic factors common to both endometrial cancer and colon cancer. Staging Endometrial carcinoma is surgically staged using the FIGO cancer staging system. i a. Stage IA: tumor is limited to the endometrium i b. Stage IB: invasion of less than half the myometrium i c. Stage IC: invasion of more than half the myometrium ii a. Stage IIA: endocervical glandular involvement only ii b.

He has otherwise not been ill: The most likely diagnosis he has is:,Kawasaki disease,Pyogenic granuloma of the tongue,Geographic tongue,Hairy tongue,"Ans. C. Geographic tongueGeographic tongue can have a changing appearance, hence its alternative description, erythema migrans. It involves atrophy of the filiform papillae, usually on the dorsum of the tongue. It is harmless and common. Hairy tongue is usually dark colored; it is caused by excess keratin and hypertrophy and elongation of the filiform papillae. Usually these patients are asymptomatic. Patients with Kawasaki traditionally have 'strawberry tongue,' where the tongue is red and slightly swollen and the papillae appear white as a contrast. These patients are generally quite ill, with high fevers for several days and other symptoms. Pyogenic granulomas can grow on the tongue, although they would be more commonly found on the gingiva, as they are caused by the body's reaction to irritation. It is a painless mass that can be red, blue, or purple",C

What is the probable diagnosis?",Neurofibromatosis,Sturge Weber,Tuberous sclerosis,Incontinentia Pigmenti,"Essentials of Diagnosis & Typical Features of Tuberous sclerosis: Facial angiofibromas or subungual fibromas. Often hypomelanotic macules, gingival fibromas. Retinal hamaomas. Coical tubers or subependymal glial nodules, often calcified. Renal angiomyolipomas. Seizures are the most common presenting symptom. Up to 20% of patients with infantile spasms (a serious epileptic syndrome) have tuberous sclerosis. Ninety-six percent of patients have one or more hypomelanotic macules, facial angiofibromas, ungual fibromas, or shagreen patches. Adenoma sebaceum, the facial skin hamaomas, may first appear in early childhood, often on the cheek, chin, and dry sites of the skin where acne is not usually seen. Mental retardation occurs in up to 50% of patients referred to teiary care centers; the incidence is probably much lower in randomly selected patients. Patients with seizures are more prone to mental retardation or learning disabilities. Diagnostic studies: More helpful is MRI or CT scanning; the latter can show the viually pathognomonic subependymal nodular calcifications and sometimes widened gyri or tubers and brain tumors. Contrast material may show the often classically located tumors near the interventricular foramen. Hypomyelinated lesions may be seen with MRI.

"A girl presents, with cystic swelling at the junction of lower 1/3rd and upper 2/3rd of anterior wall of vagina at 10 0' Clock position. The Diagnosis is :",Baholin's cyst,Ganer's cyst,Adenocarcinoma,Vaginal Inclusion Cyst,"Ans. is b i.e. Ganer's cyst Ganer's cyst is a cyst formed in Ganer duct. Ganer's duct is a remnant of Wolffian duct. The duct passes downward by the side of the uterus to the level of internal os. It then runs forward to reach the anteriolateral aspect of the vaginal wall and may reach down as far as the hymen. The cyst can be diagnosed by its position as it is found on the lateral or anterolateral wall (here 10 0' clock position) of the vagina. lnfact majority of the vaginal cysts arise from Ganer's duct. They can be distinguished from Baholin's cyst, urethrocele, cystocele and urethral diveiculum by their position, by the fact they do not disappear with pressure or with change of posture and by demonstrating with around or other means that they do not communicate with the bladder or urethra. On the other hand Baholin's cyst arises from Baholin's gland which lies near the junction of middle and posterior third of labia majora therefore the cyst is also found there (not on the junction of lower 1/3 and upper 2/ 3 anterior wall of vagina). Vaginal inclusion cyst (Shaw 14/e, p 122) is mainly seen at lower end of the vagina on its posterior surface and is caused by tags of mucosa embedding inside the scar that later forms a cyst.",B

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) it as a syndrome of sudden peripaum shock. This is a catastrophic obstetric emergency that can present as sudden, profound, and unexpected maternal collapse associated with hypotension, hypoxaemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It occurs when amniotic fluid, fetal cells, hair, or other debris enter the maternal circulation. Risk Factors: Advanced maternal age; multiparity; meconium stained liquor; intrauterine fetal death; polyhydramnios; strong frequent or tetanic uterine contractions; maternal history of allergy or atopy; chorioamnionitis; AFE is caused by fetal antigens in the amniotic fluid stimulating a cascade of endogenous immune mediators, producing a reaction similar to anaphylaxis",A

Any cyst in mediastinum (posterior), abdomen or intraspinal, in association with vertebral defect, suggest the diagnosis of neuroentric cyst.

Neuroenteric cysts
These cysts result from incomplete separation of the notochord from the foregut which causes a persistent communication or adhesion between the ectoderm of spinal cord and endoderm of the foregut.

The lining epithelium of these cysts are endodermal in origin.
These cysts are associated with -


Vertebral anomalies (most common) → Hemivertebrae, spina bifida, fused vertebrae, absent vertebrae, diastematomyelia.
Intestinal anomalies → Duplication, malrotation, imperforate anus.

Which of the following is considered a pa of the broad ligament?,Mesovarium,Ovarian ligament,Round ligament of the uterus,Suspensory Ligament of the ovary,"The mesovarium, mesometrium, and mesosalpinx are the three peritoneal sections that create the broad ligament. The mesosalpinx covers the uterine tube and hangs below it to meet with the mesovarium. The mesovarium covers the ovary and ovarian ligament. It extends posteriorly from the mesosalpinx like a shelf. The mesometrium makes up the rest of the broad ligament. The ovarian ligament is located in the broad ligament but is not pa of the broad ligament. It is a round cord that attaches the ovary to the uterus just below the point where the uterine tube enters the uterus. The round ligament of the uterus reaches the lateral surface of the uterus below the uterine tube. It is continuous with the ovarian ligament and it holds the fundus of the uterus forward. The suspensory ligaments of the ovary are peritoneal folds that cover the ovarian neurovascular supply as these vessels pass over the pelvic brim to reach the ovary.

If husband and wife are clinically normal and the child has developed the disease, then both husband and wife are carriers of cystic fibrosis. Note: There are 2 alleles for this, say for example 'A' = normal allele and 'a' = abnormal allele. So, if each parent is phenotypically normal and their child is affected, then they are carriers, i.e., 'Aa'. So, each parent has a 0.5 (50%) probability of passing the affected allele to the next generation. Also, having each child is an independent event, and the chance that the child receives abnormal allele from the father (0.5), as well as mother(0.5), is equal to 0.5*0.5 = 0.25 i.e., 25% Ref: Nelson Textbook of pediatrics 21st edition Pgno: 644",C

All of the following changes are seen in pregnancy except :,Increased stroke volume,Increased cardiac output,Increased Intravascular volume,Increased peripheral vascular resistance,"CARDIAC OUTPUT: Increases from 5th week of pregnancy, reaches its peak 40-50% at about 30-34 weeks. Thereafter the CO remains static till term. CO is lowest in the sitting or supine position and highest in the right or left lateral or knee chest position. Cardiac output increases fuher during labor (+50%) and immediately following delivery (+70%) over the pre-labor values. MAP also rises. There is squeezing out of blood from the uterus into the maternal circulation (auto transfusion) during labor and in the immediate postpaum. CO returns to pre-labor values by one hour following delivery and to the pre-pregnant level by another 4 weeks time. The increase in CO is caused by: (1) Increased blood volume (2) To meet the additional O2 required due to increased metabolic activity during pregnancy. The increase in CO is chiefly affected by increase in stroke volume and increase in pulse rate to about 15 per minute. BLOOD PRESSURE: Systemic vascular resistance(SVR) decreases (-21%) due to the smooth muscle relaxing effect of progesterone, NO, prostaglandins or ANP.

A primigravida at 37 week of gestation reported to labour room with central placenta previa with heavy bleeding per vaginum. The fetal heart rate was normal at the time of examination. The best management option of her is:,Expectant management,Cesarean section,Induction and vaginal delivery,Induction and forceps delivery,"The patient in the question:

Has gestational age = 37 weeks i.e. fetus has attained maturity so immediate termination of pregnancy is recommended.
Has central placenta previa Type IV i.e. vaginal delivery is contraindicated, cesarean section has to be done.

“In patients with heavy bleeding an efficient management plan including life support measures and immediate operative intervention is the only way to avoid a maternal death.”
It further says – on p 339
“Patients with placenta previa and severe bleeding should be delivered by cesarean section irrespective of the type of placenta previa.”
So, from the above discussion, it is very much clear that in this patient, immediate cesarean section is the best resort. Friends, here I want to point out that earlier it was said that for minor degrees of placenta previa, vaginal delivery can be tried, but now, irrespective of degree of placenta previa, cesarean section is done and recommended.",B

If the life style factor that is causing infeility in a young male is identified. Which of the following life style modification will have no effect?,Weight gain,Less exercise,Vegetarian diet,Weight loss,"Ans. c. Vegetarian diet Vegetarian diet will have minimal or no effect on feility. 1 'Weight definitely matters when it comes to feility. Women who are overweight - or underweight - tend to have a more difficult time conceiving. The same goes for men, but more about that later.'- http //www early-pregnancy-tests com/ weight-feility html 'Exercise can affect feility in several ways. Over-exercising is one of the bigger causes of infeility for women. If a woman exercises too much, she is at a risk of losing too much of her body fat. Body fat plays an essential role in the production of estrogen; without enough estrogen, a woman who over-exercises might not ovulate. The technical term for not ovulating is oligomenorrhea, and is a major cause of feility problems. Women who don't get enough exercise can impact their feility negatively as well. By not getting enough exercise, a woman runs the risk of becoming overweight or obese. An overweight or obese woman, because she has more fat cells, can actually have too much estrogen. This overproduction of estrogen can negatively impact ovulation and conception. In addition, being overweight puts you at risk for insulin resistance, which can ultimately keep you from ovulating. http://wwwbabyhopes.com/aicles/exercise-feility.html",C

Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 344; Sheila Balakrishnan, p 369Rh anti D immunoglobulin (IgG) is given to unimmunized Rh negative mothers with Rh positive fetus to prevent active immunization and formation of antibodies against fetal RBC's. The Anti D binds to antigen sites on the fetal red cells so that these cells do not mount an immune response, provided the baby is Rh negative and direct coombs test done on baby is negative. If mother's IUT is positive or fetus has positive direct coombs test, it means mother is already immunized. In such cases there is no point in giving anti D.Indications for Anti D immunoprophylaxis:First trimesterLater pregnancyMiscarriageEctopic (medically or surgically managed)Hydatidiform moleThreatened abortionMedical or surgical MTPChorionic villus samplingMiscarriageAmniocentesisFetal blood samplingAntepartum hemorrhageExternal cephalic versionRoutine antepartum prophylaxisDeliveryIntrauterine fetal deathManual removal of placentaNote: As far as intrauterine fetal transfusion is concerned.

Most common malignancy in childhood is,Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL),Bone tumor,Wilm's tumor,Retinoblastoma,"(A) Acute Lymphoblastic Leukomia (ALL) # LEUKEMIA is a cancer of the blood cells. It is the most common childhood cancer, accounting for almost one-third of all childhood cancers.# Types of leukemia include:> Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL): Commonly referred to as 'childhood leukemia', because it is the most common child- hood cancer. Almost 75% of children with leukemia have ALL, a cancer of the lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and the lymphoid organs of the body. They are involved in the body's immune system. Usually occurs between 2 and 8 years old.> Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML): AML (acute myeloid leukemia, acute nonlymphatic leukemia or ANLL) is cancer of the myeloid blood cells which are produced in the bone marrow and which help fight bacterial infections. Usually occurs in people over age 25, but sometimes affects teenagers and children. Wilm's tumour: also called Nephroblastoma, is a type of cancer that originates in the kidney. Wilm's tumour is the second most common type of all childhood solid tumours. Average age of diagnosis is between 2 and 3 years when the disease affects only one kidney, but often diagnosed at a younger age when both kidneys are involved.> Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: affects the lymph nodes that are found deep within the body and is the third most common childhood cancer. There are many types of lymphoma, including Burkitt's, non-Burkitt's, and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Most often in children between 2 and 10. More common in boys than girls.# Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone sarcomas in children and the sixth most common malignancy in children. These tumours often start at the end of the bone.

Most sensitive diagnosis test for ectopic pregnancy,Transvaginal USG,Culdocentesis,MRI,Serial monitoring of (-HCG,"Transvaginal ultrasound Diagnosis of Ectopic pregnancy Pregnancy is definitely diagnosed by demonstrating intrauterine sac. - A normal intrauterine sac appears regular and well defined on ultrasound. So ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed by demonstrating the absence of the intrauterine sac. In a woman in whom ectopic pregnancy is suspected because of pain, bleeding and positive pregnancy test, performance of vaginal sonography is the logical first step. If the sonography demonstrates live intrauterine fetus then ectopic pregnancy is extremely unlikely. Alternatively if the uterus is empty, an ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed based on the visualization of an adnexal mass separate from the ovaries. 3-hCG hormones also play an impoant role in the diagnosis of pregnancy. fi HCG is a hormone secreted during pregnancy. It is positive in viually 100% of ectopic pregnancies. However, a positive test only confirms pregnancy and does not indicate whether it is intrauterine or extrauterine. In normal pregnancy pHCG should double up every 2 days but in ectopic pregnancy the rate of increase of fl hCG is slow. 13 hCG litres and ultrasound complement one another in detecting ectopic pregnancy and have led to earlier detection. By correlating fl hCG titres with ultrasound .findings an ectopic pregnancy can often be differentiated.from intrauterine pregnancy. An intrauterine sac should be visible by transvaginal ultrasound when the p hCG is approximately 1000 ml p/m1 and by transabdominal ultrasound approximately 1 week later when the fi hCG is 1800-3600 ?nip/int. Thus when an empty uterine cavity is seen with a 13 hCG litre above this threshold, the patient is likely to have an ectopic pregnancy. An empty cavity is less of a concern when a fihCG below this threshold is obtained. Serum progesterone measuremen A single measurement of serum progesterone may sometimes clarify the diagnosis when ectopic pregnancy is suspected, but Its accuracy is crude and the customary thresholds are < 5 ng/m and > 25 'tend. i.e.a value exceeding 25 ng/m1 excludes ectopic pregnancy with 97.5% sensitivity, value below 5 ng/ml occur in only .3 percent of normal regnancies. So normal pregnancies can be excluded if the progesterone level is below 5%. Surgical diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy :- Laparoscopy Direct visualization of the ,fallopian tubes and pelvis by diagnostic laparoscopy offers a reliable diagnosis in most cases of suspected ectopic pregnancy and a ready transition to definitive operative therapy. At times, identification of an early unruptured tubal pregnancy may be difficult even if the tube is .fully visualized. Inspite of the low morbidity and quick recovery time, laparoscopy usually is performed when, on the basis of noninvasive test or curettage results, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is fairly ceain and medical therapy is not planned. In these cases laporoscopy is used both for therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. Laparotomy Open abdominal surgery is preferred when the woman is hemodynamically unstable or when laparoscopy is not feasible. Laparotomy should not be delayed while laparoscopy is performed in a woman with obvious abdominal hemorrhage that required immediate definitive treatment. Culdocentesis Culdocentesis is the transvaginal passage of a needle into the posterior cul-de-sac in order to determine whether free blood is present in the abdomen. This procedure is useful in the diagnosis of intraperitoneal bleeding. This procedure will reveal nonclotting blood if intra-abdominal bleeding has occurred. If culdocentesis is positive, laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed immediately. Indeed, some argue that the main purpose of culdocentesis is, not in diagnosis but to better prioritize patients so that those with positive culdocentensis are taken immediately to the operating room. More on imaging procedures used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy Vaginal sonography There has been much improvement in the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy using vaginal sonography. Its use results in earlier and more specific diagnosis of uterine pregnancy than abdominal sonography and it has become the imaging method of choice in early pregnancy.

A primigravida with veex presentation is having fully dilated cervix. Head is well engaged and is having a station of +2. Foetal hea monitoring shows late deceleration. Most appropriate management in such a case would be: September 2009,Observation,Vacuum extraction,Forceps application,Immediate Caesarean,"Ans. C: Forceps Application Criteria for types of forceps deliveries: Outlet forceps: - The scalp is visible at the introitus, without separating the labia. The fetal skull has reached the pelvic floor. - The sagittal suture is in anteroposterior diameter, right or left occiput anterior or posterior position (ie, the fetal head is at or on the perineum and rotation does not exceed 45deg). Low forceps: The leading point of the fetal skull is at a station greater than or equal to +2 cm and is not on the pelvic floor; any degree of rotation may be present. Mid forceps: The station is above +2 cm, but the head is engaged. High forceps: Previous systems classified high-forceps deliveries as procedures performed when the head is not engaged. High-forceps deliveries are not recommended. The following indications apply to use of forceps, when no contraindications exist: Prolonged second stage: This includes nulliparous woman with failure to deliver after 2 hours without, and 3 hours with, conduction anesthesia. It also includes multiparous woman with failure to deliver after 1 hour without, and 2 hours with, conduction anesthesia. Suspicion of immediate or potential fetal compromise in the second stage of labor. Shoening of the second stage for maternal benefits: Maternal indications include, but are not limited to, exhaustion, bleeding, cardiac or pulmonary disease, and history of spontaneous pneumothorax. In skilled hands, fetal malpositions, including the after-coming head in breech vaginal delivery, can be indications for forceps delivery. Prerequisites for forceps delivery include the following: The head must be engaged. The cervix must be fully dilated and retracted. The position of the head must be known. Clinical assessment of pelvic capacity should be performed. No dispropoion should be suspected between the size of the head and the size of the pelvic inlet and mid pelvis. The membranes must be ruptured. The patient must have adequate analgesia. The operator should be competent in the use of the instruments",C

Resolution of corpus luteum occurs because of:,Increased levels of progesterone,Increased levels of estrogen,Decreased levels of LH,Decreased levels of FSH,"Continued corpus luteum function depends on continued LH production. In the absence of this stimulation, the corpus luteum will invariably regress after 12 to16 days and form scar-like corpora albicans. In the absence of pregnancy, the corpus luteum regresses, and estrogen and progesterone levels wane. If pregnancy occurs, HCG from the placenta will mimic LH action and the corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone.",C

In the question, FSH levels are 6mIU/mL, that means this is a case of secondary amenorrhea with normal FSH values.* In case of pituitary failure - as is evident from the flow diagram - values of FSH should be lower than the normal values. So Option'd' is ruled out* Incase of ovarian failure - estrogen is deficient so negative feedback on FSH will be absent, thus values of FSH will be more than normal. In case of ovarian failure/ menopause, FSH is above 40mIU/mL so option a is also ruled out.* Normal FSH and amenorrhea point towards uterine pathology. The patient had a spontaneous abortion following which a curettage is generally required which would be responsible for intrauterine synechiae (Asherman's Syndrome). Thus, the most probable diagnosis is uterine synechiae.KEY POINTSRememberHyperprolactinemia leads to decreased levels of FSH.",B

Shivering (Ref: Ghai 7/e pe p115)Neonates lack shivering mechanism. (A1IMS November 2006 Repeat)'On exposure to cold and wet environment, the neonate tries to generate heat by increased activity (crying with agitated movement) and a sympathetic surge that causes vasoconstriction and non-shivering thermogenesis in the brown fat. Babies attempt to conserve heat by peripheral vasoconstriction. ''Brown fat is a well-vascularized, sympathetically innervated lipid collection located in the axillae, groin, nape of the neck, interscapular area and perineal area. Cold stress causes the release of norepinephrine that uncouples beta-oxidation in fat with resultant heat generation. Preterm and small-for-gestational age inf ants have immature thermogenic response because of scanty brown fat stores.'Role of Brown Fat in Thermogenesis* A newborn baby is more prone to develop hypothermia because of large surface area per unit of body weight.* In infants, brown fat is an important site of thermogenesis. It results in the so-called non-shivering thermogenesis.* Brown fat is located around the adrenal glands, kidney, nape of neck, interscapular and axillary region.* Metabolism of brown fat leads to heat production.* Blood floiving through the brown fat becomes warm and through circulation, transfers heat to other parts of the body. This mechanism oh heat production is know n as non-shivering thermogenesisy.",A

"In beta thalassemia, there is –","Increase in beta chain, decrease in alpha chain","Decrease in beta chain, increase in alpha chain","Decrease in beta chain, decrease in alpha chain","Increase in beta chain, increase in alpha chain","Beta - thalassemia 

The abnormality common to all P-thalassemias is diminished synthesis of structurally normal β-globin chains, coupled with unimpaired synthesis of α-chain.
The reduced supply of (β-globin chain diminishes production of hemoglobin tetramers, causing hypochromic and microcytic anemia.
The haematological consequences of diminished synthesis of one globin chain stem not only from low intracellular hemoglobin, but also from a relative excess of the unimpaired chain.

Consequences of thalassemia

In (β-thalassemia, anemia is produced by two mechanisms


Deficit in HbA synthesis produce hypochromic microcytic anemia.
Excess free α-chains aggregate into insoluble inclusions within red cells and their precursors (normoblasts). These inclusions cause membrane damage that results in apoptosis of normoblasts in the marrow → ineffective erythropoiesis. The red cells which escape death in bone marrow are prone to splenic sequestration and destruction due to cell membrane damage and decreased deformability, leading to extravascular hemolysis.


The second mechanism is more important in producing anemia.
Anaemia leads to several additional problems -


Increased erythropoietin secretion in response to anemia leads to massive erythroid hyperplasia in bone marrow that results in expansion of bone marrow and skeletal deformities.
Erythropoietin also induces extramedullary erythropoiesis in liver and spleen -p Hepatosplenomegaly.
Excessive absorption of iron (in response to ineffective erythropoiesis) along with repeated blood transfusion in severe β-thalassemia results in iron overload and secondary hemochromatosis → iron overload in heart, liver, endocrine glands, spleen -4 cardiac failure / endocrine deficiency → Death.",B

Most common foreign body aspirated is nuts (peanuts).
Most airway foreign bodies lodge in a bronchus (right more than left).

Clinical manifestions
Three stages of symptoms may results : -


Stage I - Initial event → Violent paroxysm of coughing (a most common symptom), choking, gagging and wheeze immediately after aspiration. If the obstruction is complete, child may be unable to vocalize (aphonia) and there may be cyanosis. If the obstruction is incomplete drooling and stridor may occur.
Stage II Asymptomatic → The foreign body becomes lodged, reflex fatigue and immediate irritating symptoms subside. This stage is most treacherous and account for a large percentage of delayed diagnosis and overlooked foreign bodies.
Stage III - Complications → Obstruction, erosions or infection can cause fever, hemoptysis, pneumonia and atelectasis. The most serious complication of foreign body aspiration is complete airway obstruction.",A

The controversy lies in option b i.e. whether routine episiotomy should be performed: Well read for yourself what williams has to say on this issue.
“There once was considerable controversy concerning whether an episiotomy should be cut routinely. It is now clear that an episiotomy will increae the risk of a tear into the external anal sphincter or the rectum or both. Conversely, anteriortears involving the urethra and labia are more common in women in whom an episiotomy is not cut. Most, advocate individualization and do not routinely perform episiotomy.”
Hence option b is incorrect.
Steps done for prevention of perineal laceration : More attention should be paid not to the perineum but to the controlled delivery of the head.

Delivery by early extension is to be avoided. Flexion of the the sub-occiput comes under the symphysis pubis so that lesser suboccipitofrontal 10 cm (4”) diameter emerges out of the introitus.
Spontaneous forcible delivery of the head is to be avoided by assuring the patient not to bear down during contractions.
To deliver the head in between contractions.
To perform timely episiotomy (when indicated not routine).
To take care during delivery of the shoulders as the wider bisacromial diameter (12 cm) emerges out of the introitus.",B

Active management of 3rd stage of labour is needed for all the following EXCEPT,Rh incompatibility,Diabetic mother,Prolonged pregnancy,Delivery of first baby of twins,"Ans. d (Delivery of first baby of twins) (Ref. Textbook of Obstetrics D.C. Dutta 6th/pg. 142)Accidental administration of ergometrine or methergin during delivery of first baby in undiagnosed twins produce grave danger to the unborn 2nd baby caused by asphyxia due to tetanic uterine contractions.MANAGEMENT OF THE THIRD STAGE OF LABORThe third stage of labor begins following the delivery of the baby and ends with the delivery of the placenta.Signs of spontaneous placental separation include an apparent lengthening of the umbilical cord, a gush of vaginal bleeding, and a change in shape of the uterus from discoid to globular along with a rise in fundal height.Active management of the third stage of labor, which involves prompt umbilical cord clamping and cutting, administration of an oxytocic agent, and gentle umbilical cord traction, reduces maternal blood loss and the frequency of postpartum hemorrhage, and lessens the risk that the third stage will be prolonged.# Cord clamping is part of management of 2nd stage of labour.# Cord traction should be used only against fundally applied counter-traction to lessen the potential for uterine inversion and catastrophic hemorrhage. If at any time heavy bleeding occurs during the third stage of labor or if the placenta is not delivered within 30 minutes of the birth, the placenta should be manually removed.# General anesthesia may be required for women who have no regional anesthesia, and curettage may be necessary if the placenta does not readily separate from the uterine wall.# Manual removal is accomplished by developing a cleavage plane with the intrauterine hand between the maternal surface of the placenta and the uterine wall, while simultaneously fixing the uterus with the abdominal hand, and progressively peeling the placenta free.# If any portion of the placenta or the membranes is missing, the uterine cavity should be manually explored. Some advocate routine exploration of the uterine cavity to reduce the risk of infection and bleeding from retained placental fragments. In most women, especially those without regional anesthesia, the benefit of manual exploration is outweighed by the discomfort it causes, as well as the increased risk for uterine infection.# The uterus should be frequently palpated following delivery of the placenta to ensure that it remains well contracted. Oxytocin, 10 to 20 U administered intramuscularly or as a dilute intravenous solution, has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage secondary to uterine atony. The birth canal, including the cervix,vagina, and perineum should be inspected for lacerations requiring repair.",D

OP Ghai 6th/pg.l94; Nelson paeds 17th /pg.908)PERTUSSISPreventionUniversal immunization of children <7 yr of age with pertussis vaccine, beginning in infancy, is central to the control ofpertussis. Current goals of immunization are protection of the individual from a significant coughing illness and controlof endemic and epidemic disease.ACELLULAR VACCINE# Multiple diphtheria and tetanus toxoids combined with acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines currently are preferred over those containing whole-cell pertussis (DTP) vaccines because of fewer adverse reactions.# Recommendations for use of DTaP are similar to recommendations for use of DTP, which continues to be given to infants and children in many other countries. Acellular pertussis vaccines all contain inactivated PT and may contain one or more other bacterial components (FHA, Pn, Fim 2 and 3).# Mild local and systemic adverse events as well as more serious events occur significantly less frequently among infants who receive DTaP compared with DTP vaccine.# DTaP containing vaccines can be administered simultaneously with any other vaccines used in standard schedules for children. Combination of vaccines that include DTaP in place of DTP can affect immunogenicity of products. Local reactions increase in rate and severity with successive doses of DTaP.# The same special considerations, precautions, contraindications, and reporting requirements for serious adverse events that exist for DTP vaccination apply to DTaP as well. Acellular pertussis vaccines are now licensed for use only among children through 6 yr of age.# Live virus vaccines should be avoided in immunocompromised patients. For patients without chronic GVHD, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular pertussis (in children <7 yr of age), inactivated polio, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Streptococcus pneumoniae immunizations may be given 12 mo after transplant, and measles- mumps-rubella immunizations after 24 mo.

Meconium aspiration is done for 3 times but no breathing occurs. Next step in resuscitation would be –,Chest compression,O2 inhalation,Bag & mask intubation,Trikling of sole,"To solve this question, one should know the resuscitation protocol of newborn.
Resuscitation protocol

As soon as the baby is delivered, five signs are assessed -


Clearance of meconium
Active breathing or crying
Good muscle tone (flexed posture and active movement of baby).
Pink color (look at tougue and lips)
Term gestation (delivery between 37-42 weeks of pregnancy).


If all signs are positive no active resuscitation is required.
If any of the 5 signs is absent, baby requires resuscitation.
The baby should be placed under the heat source (radiant warmer) and subjected to a set of intervention known as initial steps.

Initial steps of resuscitation
1. Positioning

The neonate should be placed on her back or side with the neck slightly extended.
This can be achieved by putting a rolled blanket or towel under the shoulders, elevating them 3/4 or 1 inch off the mattress.

2. Suctioning

The mouth and nose should' be suctioned
The mouth is suctioned first to ensure that there is nothing for the infant to aspirate when the nose is suctioned.
One should not insert the catheter very deep in mouth or nose for suction ---> Stimulation of posterior

pharynx during the first few minutes after birth can produce a vagal responce, causing severe bradycardia or apnea.
3.Dry, stimulate and reposition
a After suctioning, the baby should be dried by using pre-warmed linen to prevent heat loss.

A brief tactile stimulation in the form of flicking the soles or rubbing the back may be provided in case of non-establishment of ood res irator efforts.

4. Free flow of oxygen

If the baby continues to be depressed, provide free flow of oxygen using a facemask.
After providing initial steps, the baby should be evaluated for three signs -


Respiration
Heart rate (HR)
Color


If baby has good breathing, HR >100 and pink color, he should be given supportive care.
If the baby is not breathing well or HR <100 then bag and mask ventilation is needed.
After the infant has received 30 seconds of ventilation with 100% oxygen by bag and mask, evaluation of heart rate should be done -

HR>100       --->          Discontinue ventilation if spontaneous respiration is present
HR 60 to 100 -->        Continue ventilation
Below 60     -->           Continue ventilation + chest compressions

After 30 seconds of chest compressions, the heart rate is checked.

BR< 60        -p            Continue chest compression and bag & mask ventilation + initiate medications.
BR > 60 Discontinue chest compression but continue bag & mask ventilation until the heart rate is above 100.",D

The CSF findings in tubercular meningitis include:,High sugar + low protein,Low sugar + high protein and lymphocytosis,High sugar + high chloride,Low sugar + high protein and lymphopenia,"Ans. B. Low sugar + high protein and lymphocytosisMeningitis is a serious manifestation of childhood tuberculosis. It may occur at any age but is most common between 6 months-24 months. There is usually a focus of primary infection or military tuberculosis. The onset is usually insidious and clinical features are divided into 3 phases. Diagnosis rests on a good history, clinical examination and may be confirmed with a lumbar puncture and neuroimaging. Lumbar puncture may reveal raised intracranial pressure with lymphocytic pleocytosis (100-500cells/mm3), elevated protein, mild hypoglycorrhachia and low chloride.

Ideal management of a 37 weeks pregnant elderly primigravida with placenta prae and active bleeding: September 2007,Labour induction,Caesarean section,Vaginal delivery,Expectant treatment,"Ans. B: Caesarean Section An initial assessment to determine the status of the mother and fetus is required. It is now considered safe to treat placenta prae on an outpatient basis if the fetus is at less than 30 weeks of gestation, and neither the mother nor the fetus are in distress. Immediate delivery of the fetus may be indicated if the fetus is mature or if the fetus or mother are in distress. Blood volume replacement (to maintain blood pressure) and blood plasma replacement (to maintain fibrinogen levels) may be necessary. In cases of fetal distress, associated complicating factors like malpresentation, elderly primigravidae, pregnancy with a previous caesarean section and contracted pelvis, a caesarean section is indicated. Caesarean section is contraindicated in cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Placenta prae increases the risk of puerperal sepsis and postpaum haemorrhage because the lower segment to which the placenta was attached contracts less well post-delivery",B

"Kamla, a 48-years-old lady underwent a hysterectomy. On the seventh day, she developed fever, burning micturition and continuous urinary dribbling. She can also pass urine voluntarily. The diagnosis is:",Vesico vaginal fistula,Urge incontinence,Stress incontinence,Uretero-vaginal fistula,"Continuous dribbling of urine following hysterectomy points towards urinary fistulas as the diagnosis.
In case of urinary fistulas, if the patient never needs to void as there is continuous dribbling it signifies that the fistula communicates with the bladder. If, there is filling and emptying of bladder along with the fistula, it suggests fistula opening into one ureter i.e. Ureterovaginal fistula.
As far as urethral fistula are concerned, they give little trouble because the urethra is normally empty of urine. However, during micturition urine passes through the fistula and may then fill the vagina to dribble during body movements for a short time afterwards.
This patient is developing symptoms on the seventh day can be explained by: 'Fistulas resulting from accidental, surgical and obstetrical trauma are produced in two ways. They can be caused by a direct injury such as cuts and then they manifest themselves immediately by hematuria and incontinence. Alternatively, if they are the outcome of pressure necrosis or of ischemia, in such a case urinary incontinence, fever and burning micturition develop 7-14 days after the accident.'

Before concluding let's rule out other options as well:

In stress incontinence, dribbling of urine occurs only when intraabdominal pressure is raised.
In urge incontinence, the patient has the urge to void urine at a moment's notice and she is unable to control her bladder and passes urine instantly.",D

The earliest morphological evidence of ovulation on endometrial biopsy is:,Pseudostratification,Basal vacuolation,Decrease in glycogen content,Predecidual reaction,"Endometrial biopsy was used in the past to find out whether the female has ovulated or not. Nowadays USG follicular monitoring is being done
Subnuclear basal vacuolation is characterized by glandular growth and presence of vacuoles due to secretion of glycogen between nuclei and basement membrane. It is due to the effect of progesterone.
Basal vacuolization is the earliest evidence of ovulation (36-48 hours after ovulation) and persists until the about 21st day of the cycle.
Pseudostratification of nuclei is characteristic of proliferation phase but persists until active progesterone secretion begins. Hence, it is noted until the 18th 19th day of the menstrual cycle.",B

Tuberculosis in children true is,Commonly sputum negative,Incidence < 5% of all TB cases,Clinically child does not show sign of florid TB,All of the above,"Tuberculosis in children :

Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Cases of tuberculosis represent 5 - 15 percent of all tubercular cases.

Clinical manifestations of TB in children :

The majority of children with tuberculosis infection develop no signs or symptoms at any level.
Occasionally.

Infection is marked by low - grade fever, mild cough, malaise and u - like symptoms.
A) Primary pulmonary disease the lung is the portal of entry in >  98% of cases.

The primary complex of tuberculosis includes local infection at the portal of entry and regional lymph nodes that drain the area.
The combination of the parenchymal pulmonary - lesion and corresponding lymph node is called Ghon complex.
Asymptomatic pleural effusion is so frequent in primary - tuberculosis that it is basically a component of the primary complex.
Nelson, It may have one of the following course : - Heating by brosis and calcification.
Progressive primary > tuberculosis. Cavity Obstructive emphysema If the incomplete obstruction is caused by lymph nodes.
Resorption atelectasis If the complete obstruction is caused by lymph nodes.
Tubercular bronchitis & bronchiectasis Hematogenous dissemination During early bacteremia seeding may occur at apex Simon's focus.
Miliary tuberculosis Collapse consolidation (segmental lesion) A combination of pneumonitis and atelectasis.

B) Chronic pulmonary tuberculosis :

Infrequent in young children.
Children above the age of seven years, especially girls are more vulnerable.

The commonest site of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is the apex of lung Puhl's lesion.

Infraclavicular lesion of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is called Assman's focus.Regional lymph nodes are not involved in chronic pulmonary TB (in contrast to primary TB). Lab investigations of pediatric TB.
ESR and blood counts : No value in diagnosis or follow up of TB.
Demonstration of AFB.
Children don't expectorate out sputum, but swallow it.

Therefore sputum is not available for examination.

"In laparoscopy, chances of hypercarbia can be reduced by keeping intraperitoneal C02 pressure <_____",10,12,13,14,"Ans. b (12) (Ref. Novak's Gynecology)INSUFFLATION NEEDLESVirtually all insufflation needles are modifications of the hollow needle designed by Veress. In cases uncomplicated by previous pelvic surgery, the preferred site for insertion is as close as possible to (or within) the umbilicus, where the abdominal wall is the thinnest.When pressed against tissue such as fascia or peritoneum, the spring-loaded blunt obturator is pushed back into the hollow needle, revealing its sharpened end. When the needle enters the peritoneal cavity, the obturator springs back into position, protecting the intraabdominal contents from injury. The handle of the hollow needle allows the attachment of a syringe or tubing for insufflation of the distention gas.1.A 3-mm incision adequate for the needle is made with a small scalpel, and the abdominal wall is elevated by gripping it in the midline below the umbilicusSafe insertion of the insufflation needle mandates that the instrument be maintained in a midline, sagittal plane while the operator directs the tip between the iliac vessels, anterior to the sacrum but inferior to the bifurcation of the aorta and the proximal aspect of the vena cava. Therefore, in women of average weight, the insufflation needle is directed at a 45-degree angle to the palienl'-S-SPLine. The needle's shaft is held by the tips of the fingers and steadily but purposefully guided into position only far enough to allow the tip's entry into the peritoneal cavity. The needle should never be forced.2.In instances in which known or suspected intraabdominal adhesions surround the umbilicus, alternative sites for insufflation needle insertion should be used.These include the pouch of Douglas, the fundus of the uterus, and the left upper quadrant, most often at the left costal margin. The left upper quadrant is preferred if there has been no previous surgery in this area. In most instances, both the insufflation needle, if used, and the primary cannula are inserted through the umbilicus.3.Before insufflation, the operator should try to detect whether the insufflation needle has been malpositioned in the omentum, mesentery, blood vessels, or hollow organs such as the stomach or bowel.Using a syringe attached to the insufflation needle, blood or gastrointestinal contents may be aspirated. This examination may be facilitated by injecting a small amount of saline into the syringe. If the needle is appropriately positioned, negative intraabdominal pressure is created by lifting the abdominal wall.4.Additional signs of proper placement may be sought after starting insufflation.The intraabdominal pressure reading should be low, reflecting only systemic resistance to the flow of CO2. Consequently, there should be little deviation from a baseline measurement, generally less than 10 mm Hg. The pressure varies with respiration and is slightly higher in obese patients. The earliest reassuring sign is the loss of liver 'dullness' over the lateral aspect of the right costal margin.5.The amount of gas transmitted into the peritoneal cavity should depend on the measured intraperitoneal pressure, not the volume of gas inflated.Intraperitoneal volume capacity varies significantly between individuals. Many surgeons prefer to insufflate to 20 mm Hg for positioning of the cannulas. This level usually provides enough counterpressure against the peritoneum, facilitating trocar introduction and potentially reducing the chance of bowel or posterior abdominal wall and vessel trauma. After placement of the cannulas, the pressure should be dropped to 10 to 12 mm Hg, which essentially eliminates hypercardia or decreased venous return of blood to the heart.",B

Which of the following statements about Rhythm method is false?,Anencephaly is a repoed complication of calender method,It is associated with no costs,Safe period can also be observed using temperature rhythm or mucous method,Abstinence is needed for about 7-10 days,"Anencephaly is not a repoed complication of calender method. The calender method or rhythm method: By this method, couple is advised avoidance of sexual intercourse around ovulation. In a 28-day cycle, ovulation normally occurs on the 14th day of the cycle, but may occur anytime between the 12th and 16th day. Spermatozoa deposited in the female genital tract may survive for 24 hrs. The ovum itself may live for 12-24 hrs. Hence intercourse between the 11th and 17th day may result in a pregnancy. The safe period is, therefore calculated from the first day of the menstrual period untill the 10th day of cycle and from the 18th and 28th day. An alternative method is to calculate the risk period, which is from 3 days before ovulation to 3 days after ovulation. In a 35-day menstrual cycle, therefore, ovulation will occur on the 21st day (that is 14 days before the nexe period) so that the risk period is from day 18 to day 24 Ref: Shaw&;s Textbook of Gynaecology 17th edition Pgno: 253",A

Recruitment of follicles to form primordial follicle is done by:,Estrogen,HCG,Follicle stimulating hormone,LH,"Ans: c (Follicle stimulating hormone) Ref: Shaw, 13th ed,p. 28Development of a primordial follicle into a graffian follicle is under the control of follicle stimulating hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary.FSH produces grow'th and development of ovarian follicles during the first 14 days after menses.This leads to gradual increase in estradiol production from granulosa cells of the ovary. This rise in estrogen suppresses FSF1 secretion initially (negative feedback).But then above a certain level, estradiol stimulates an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of GnRH pulses resulting in marked increase in LH secretion (positive feedback).i.e. minimum estradiol causes decrease in FSH high level of estradiol causes increase in LH secretionThis mid cycle peak of LH i.e.. LH surge induces ovulation. Thus in late proliferative phase of menstrual cycle. LH surge is triggered by an estradiol peak which exerts a positive feedback on LH secretion.Exogenously administered estrogen causes negative feedback on LH secretion.ProgesteroneIt maintains the uterus in quiescent stage during pregnancy by relaxing the myometrium.Corpus luteum is the major source of progesterone during first 10 week of gestation.After 12 weeks placenta is the major source of production of progesterone.The major substrate for progesterone is maternal cholesterol.Plasma progesterone level rises during pregnancy till term and falls rapidly after delivery, undetectable after 24 hrs post partum.Fetal synthesis contributes little to maternal level, therefore progesterone level will remain high even after fetal demise.Note:Corpus luteum is maintained by - lutenizing hormoneFern pattern is due to - estrogenAria- Stella reaction in ectopic pregnancy is due to - progesterone",C

"A 2-hour-old neonate born by normal vaginal delivery has a scalp swelling, with normal cry and activity. What is the probable cause?",Serosanguineous extra periosteal fluid,Focal sub-aponeurotic blood collection,Chignon,Depressed skull fracture,"Ans. (a) Serosanguineous extra periosteal fluid.* The reason why this skull looks asymmetrical is due to moulding. This is a caput succedaneum, where there is a serosanguineous subcutaneous extra periosteal fluid collection with poorly defined margins caused by pressure of presenting part of skull against the dilating cervix. The caput succedaneum extends across the midline, crossing over suture lines and resolves over few days. * Cephalhematoma takes >24 hours to develop and is a focal sub-periosteal bleeding. On resolution which may take weeks it may harden followed by softening from the center. It is associated with instrumentational delivery or prolonged labor which are not given in the history.* Chignon is seen after vacuum extraction and sometimes complicated by sub aponeurotic hemorrhage.",A

Amniocentesis done at:,14-18 weeks,16-20 weeks,20-24 weeks,24-28 weeks,"Amniocentesis (genetic) is an invasive procedure. * Cytogenetic analysis--The desquamated fetal cells in the amniotic fluid, obtained by amniocentesis or trophoblast cells from CVS or fetal blood cells obtained by cordocentesis are cultured, G banded and examined to make a diagnosis of chromosomal anomalies, e.g. trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome),monosomy X (Turner's syndrome) and others. * DNA analysis--Single gene disorders (cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease) can be diagnosed using specific DNA probes. DNA amplification is done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The specific chromosomal region containing the mutated gene can be identified. * Biochemical--Amniotic fluid AFP level is high when the fetus suffers from open neural tube defects.This is also confirmed by ultrasound scanning. The normal AFP concentration in liquor amnii at the 16th week is about 20 mg/liter. Amniotic fluid level of 17 hydroxy progesterone is raised in congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

This is only 25 % of al the cases of hirsutism, and not the commonest! The most common cause of hyperandrogenism and hirsutism is PCOS. There are only two major criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS: anovulation and the presence of hyperandrogenism as established by clinical or laboratory means. Revised criteria (2 out of 3) 1. Oligo ovulation or anovulation 2. Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism 3. Polycystic ovaries and exclusion of other etiologies (congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumors, Cushing's syndrome) From Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop These features alone are sufficient for the diagnosis in the absence of other pathologies accounting for hyperandrogenism (i.e., AOAH, or ovarian neoplasm, Cushing syndrome) or anovulation (i.e., hypogonadotropic or hypergonadotropic disorders, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease).

The most appropriate method for collecting urine for culture in case of vesicovaginal fistula is:,Suprapubic needle aspiration,Midstream clean catch,Foley's catheterisation,Sterile speculum,"'Urine culture is mandatory before surgery and infection should be treated. The urine is collected by Catheterization.'
In VVF
'Preoperative collection is best to be done through ureteric catheterization.'  So friends undoubtedly ureteric catheterization. (Don't get confused - it is not Foley's catheterization) is the best method for collecting urine for culture in a case of VVF. This option is not given, so, we will have to look for next best option.

'Urine collected through a sterile vaginal speculum will not serve the purpose because of contamination. 
Midstream clean catch sample is also contaminated in vesicovaginal fistulas. (Option 'b')
Supra pubic aspiration done after proper cleansing and draping the patient with full bladder, is easy and next best method of urine collection after ureteric catheterization. But the only prerequisite for this method of collection is 'A full bladder' which cannot be fulfilled in a case of VVF as urine continuously dribbles from the vagina and therefore, bladder is never full. (Ruling out Option 'a')
By exclusion our answer is Foley's catheterization, although chances of contamination are present in Foley's catheterization but they can be reduced if proper vaginal douching is done prior to collection of urine.",C

As far as Choroid plexus cyst is Concerned : 'Several investigators have suggested that choroids plexus cysts are also associated with an increased risk of trisomy 21. However, our group demonstrated that the frequency of choroids plexus cysts among fetuses with trisomy 21 was the same as that among fetuses without trisomy 21, suggesting that the presence of choroid plexus cysts should not increase a patient's calculated risk of having a fetus with Down syndrome. This is in agreement with the work from Gupta and co-workers, who repoed a 1 in 880 risk of Down syndrome among fetuses with isolated choroid plexus cysts detected antenatally.' 'The presence of a cyst in the choroid plexus in an axial view through the upper poion of fetal head has been correlated with the increased risk of Trisomy 18.'

NADA's Criteria o Either one major or two minor criteria are necessary for indicating the presence of hea disease. A) Major Criteria 1) Systolic murmur of grade III or more. The systolic murmur is classified into : ? a) Ejection systolic murmur b) Pansystolic murmur Pansystolic murmur is always abnormal no matter what is its intesity. Only three lesions produce pansystolic murmur --> i)VSD ii) MR iii) TR Ejection systolic murmur on the other hand may be organic or functional. If ejection systolic murmur is associated with thrill, it is always organic. If ejection systolic murmur is more than grade III intensity --) It is organic. Grade III or less ejection systolic murmur of a functional type may be heard in anemia or high fever in otherwise normal children. 2) Diastolic murmur Presence of diastolic murmur always indicates the presence of organic hea disease. There are two exceptions. i) Severe hypeension --> Reduction of BP may cause an AR murmur to disappear. ii) Anemia --> May result in delayed diastolic murmur across the tricuspid and mitral area. 3) Cyanosis Central cyanosis indicates presence of hea disease if lung disease has been excluded. 4) CHF Presence of CHF indicates presence of hea disease except in neonates and infants who get CHF from causes such as hypoglycemia and anemia. B) Minor criteria 1) Systolic murmur less than grade III in intensity. 2) Abnormal second hea sound Abnormal S2 always indicates presence of hea disease. It has been included as a minor criterian only because auscultation is an individual and subjective finding. 3) Abnormal ECG Main value of ECG lies in determining the : ? i) Mean QRS axis ii) Right or left atrial hyperophy iii) Right or left ventricular hyperophy 4) Abnormal X-ray If there is cardiomegaly in a good inspiratory film, it is highly suggestive for the presence of hea disease. 5) Abnormal BP",C

"A 32 year old female with a history of 2 mid-trimester abortions, comes now with 32 weeks of pregnancy and labour pains with Os dilated 2 cm. All are done, except:",Immediate circlage,Betamethasone,Antibiotics,Tocolytics,"In the question, patient is presenting with history of 2 midtrimester abortions and gestational age is 32 weeks with labor pains and dilatation of cervix 2 cm
The membranes are not ruptured, hence management includes:

Betamethasone: To accelerate lung maturation of the fetus.
Tocolysis: Tocolytics are not given with the aim to arrest preterm labor for a long time, but to prolong the labor for 48 hours.

This servers the following purposes:

The corticosteroids get time to act.
Allows time for transport of the woman to better obstetrical centre.

Beta-adrenergic agonists, calcium-channel blockers, or indomethacin are the recommended tocolytic agents for such short-term use–up to 48 hours. American college of obstetrics and gynecology recommends that women with preterm contractions without cervical change, especially those with cervical dilation of less than 2 cm, generally should not be treated with tocolytics.
In general, if tocolytics are given, they should be administered concomitantly with corticosteroids. The gestational age range for their use in debatable. However, because corticosteroids are not generally used after 33 weeks and because the perinatal outcomes in preterm neonates are generally good after this time, most practitioners do not recommend use of tocolytics at or after 33 weeks. In this patient G: Age is 32 weeks and cervix is 2 cm dilated so the use of tocolytics is justified

Rescue cerclage (Williams 24/e, p 857): There is support for the concept that cervical incompetence and preterm labor lie on a spectrum leading to preterm delivery. If cervical incompetence is recognized with threatened preterm labor, then emergency cerclage can be attempted.

Cervical cerclage is done in 3 conditions:

Cervical incompetence
Prophylactically in women identified on USG to have short cervix <15 mm
Rescue cerclage–as discussed above.


Antibiotics: Do not have a role in preterm pregnancy with intact membranes. In a study (ORACLE 11 trial) antimicrobials were given to patients with preterm labor but without membrane rupture, the results were disappointing. In his review, Goldenberg (2002) also concluded that antimicrobial treatment of women with preterm labor for the sole purpose of preventing delivery is generally not recommended. In a follow-up of the ORACLE II trial, Kenyon and associates (2008 b) reported that fetal exposure to antimicrobials in this clinical setting was associated with an increased cerebral palsy rate at age 7 years compared with that of children without fetal exposure.",C

If the fetus is premature and if hemorrhaging is not severe, vaginal examination of a woman suspected of having placenta previa frequently can be delayed until 37 weeks gestation; this delay in the potentially hazardous examination reduces the risk of prematurity, which is often associated with placenta previa. Vaginal examination, when needed to determine whether a low- lying placenta is covering the internal os of the cervix, should be performed in an operating room fully prepared for an emergency cesarean section (i.e., a double setup).

A 35 yr old woman presents with primary infeility & palpable pelvic mass. Her CA-125 level is 0 U/nil. Diagnosis is,Ovarian Ca,Endometrioma,Tuberculosis,Borderline ovarian tumor,"Endometrioma Another clinical based question with insufficient information to make any confirm diagnosis. At the best we can try to make the most probable diagnosis. Let's first see CA-125. CA-125 This is a non-specific tumor marker. Cut off level of CA-125 is < 35 U/ml. Ca 125 levels, as described above, can be raised in all the four options, so not very helpful in reaching a diagnosis. But if we weigh CA-125 level in terms of significance then it is least significant in tuberculosis as it is neither used for diagnosis nor for follow-up in tuberculosis. Palpable mass may be present in all the four conditions. Infeility is a feature of both endometriosis and tuberculosis. But for ovarian cancers infeility is a risk factor, not a feature or presenting symptom. Coming to Age: Patient is 35 yrs old. Age of 35 yrs ours endometrioma most. Peak incidence of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (most common ovarian cancer) is at 56-60 yrs of age and for border line tumor average age is 46 yrs approximately (Novak). Patients with tuberculosis are in their twenties commonly, the maximum age incidence at diagnosis being 28 yrs.

In Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis which electrolyte should be replenished?,Na+,K+,C1--,HCO3--,"ANSWER: (B) K+REF: With textHypertrophic pyloric stenosis presents with hyponatremic, hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduriaSchwartz 9th ed chapter 3, 39: Treatment includes replacement of the volume deficit with isotonic saline and then potassium replacement once adequate urine output is achieved. Fluid resuscitation with correction of electrolyte abnormalities and metabolic alkalosis is essential before induction of general anesthesia for operation. For most infants, administration of fluid containing 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with 2 to 4 mEq/kg of added potassium at a rate of approximately 150 to 175 mL/kg for 24 hours will correct the underlying deficit. After resuscitation, a Fredet-Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is performedSabiston 18tk ed ch 71 states: The definitive treatment of choice is pyloromyotomy. But Before surgery, it is important that the infant is hydrated with IV fluids to establish a normal urine output. It is important that the underlying metabolic alkalosis is slowly corrected with normal saline. Potassium is not given until the intravascular volume has been restored and normal urine output has resumed.Nelson 's 18th ed ch:326.1 states that: The preoperative treatment is directed toward correcting the fluid, add-base, and electrolyte losses. Intravenous fluid therapy is begun with 0.45- 0.9% saline, in 5-10% dextrose, with the addition of potassium chloride in concentrations of 30-50 mEq/L. Fluid therapy should be continued until the infant is rehydrated and the serum bicarbonate concentration is <30 mEq/dL, which implies that the alkalosis has been corrected.",B

Biochemical abnormalities and pruritus in obstetric cholestasis persists until delivery following which resolution occurs. - Pruritus usually improves within 1 week liver function tests returns to normal in 3-7 days in the majority and 4-6 weeks postnatally in the remainder. Adverse obstetric outcomes with cholestatic pregnancy was .first quantified by Fisk who repoed an overall perinatal moality of 70 per 100 live bih and intrauterine deaths of 30 per 1000 pregnancies. - There is an increased risk of intrauterine death, classically. .from 37 weeks gestation, an increased risl of ineconium passage and increased risk of preterm labour. - The mechanism of intrauterine death is unceain but is likely to be related to a toxic effect on the fetus. This resulted in a policy of active management for obstetric cholestasis. - 'With active management and elective delivery at 37 to 38 weeks, the perinatal moality reduced to zero'.",C

Ovarian tumour which is bilateral,>Dysgerminoma,>Endodermal sinus tumour.,>Immature teratoma,>Embryonal cell carcinoma,"Dysgerminoma 10-15% of dysgerninomas are bilateral Dysgerminoma is the only germ cell malignancy that has this significant rate of bilaterily, other germ tumors are rarely being bilateral. Fewer than 5% of all ovarian tumours are germ cell in origin. They include : - Teratonia - Dysgerminoma - Endodermal sinus tumour (yolk sac tumour) - Embryonal carcinoma The unique characteristics of germ cell tumours are : - They generally occur in younger women - They display an unusual aggressive natural history and are commonly cured with less extensive nonsterlizing surgery and chemotherapy. The germ cell neoplasmas can be divided into three groups. (i) Benign tumour (usually dermoid cyst) (ii) Malignant tumours that arise from dermoid cyst (iii) Primitive malignant germ cell tumours including dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumours, immature teratomas embryonal carcinoma choriocarcinoma. Clinical features of malignant germ cell tumours - Malignant germ cell tumours are usually large - Bilateral disease is rare, except in dysgerminoma (10-15% are bilateral) - Abdominal or pelvic pain in young women is the usual presenting symptom. - Serum human chorionic gonadotropicin ((3-hCG) and a fetoprotein levels are useful in diagnosis and management. - Most of the malignant germ cell tumours are managed with chemotherapy after surgery. - Dysgerminoma is the ovarian counterpa of testicular carcinoma.

As far as Choroid plexus cyst is Concerned : -Several investigators have suggested that choroids plexus cysts are also associated with an increased risk of trisomy 21. However, our group demonstrated that the frequency of choroids plexus cysts among fetuses. with trisomy 21 was the same as that among fetuses without trisomy 21, suggesting that the presence of choroid plexus cysts should not increase a patient's calculated risk of having a fetus with Down syndrome. This is in agreement with the work from Gupta and co-workers, who repoed a 1 in 880 risk of Down syndrome among fetuses with isolated choroid plexus cysts detected antenatally.' 'The presence of a cyst in the choroid plexus in an axial view through the upper poion of fetal head has been correlated with the increased risk of Trisomy 18.'

True about VSD are all except -,Left to right shunt,Pansystolic mormor,Reverse spitting of S2,Left atrial hyperophy,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Reverse spliting of S2 Hemodynamics of VSD o A VSD results in shunting of oxygenated blood from left to right because left ventricle has more pressure than right Left to right shunt. o Blood flow from left to right ventricle due to high pressure gradient --> Pansystolic murmur and systolic thrill. o Because left ventricle stas contracting before Right ventricle, pansystolic murmur stas early --> Masking of SI. o This pressure gradient is maintained throughout the systole pansystolic murmur lasts long --> Masking of S2. o Towards the end of systole, the declining left ventricular pressure becomes lower than aoic Early closure of A2. o Left to right shunt occurs during systole at a time when the right ventricle is also contracting, therefore left to right shunt streams to pulmonary aery more or less directly --> No volume overload --> Right ventricle size remains normal. Increased blood flow through pulmonary valve --> Pulmonary ejection systolic murmur and delay & accentuated P2. o Early closure of A2 and delayed closure of P2 cause --> Widely split S2 (But this is usually masked by pansystolic murmur). o Larger volume reaches the left atrium -3 Left atrial hyperophy o Increased blood flow through mitral valve -3 Accentuated Si (But it is masked by pansystolic murmur) and delayed diastolic murmur. Note : o Ejection systolic murmur of pulmonary valve can not be separated from pansystolic murmur. o The effect of ejection systolic murmur is a selective transmission of pansystolic murmur to the upper left sternal border (pulmonary valve area) In this area ejection characteristic of this murmur can be recognized since it does not mask the aoic component of S2. For the same reason second hea sound (S2) can be heard in the pulmonary area where it is not masked by pansystolic murmur.",C

Risk of HIV transmission is highest during?,During Caesarian section,During antepartum period,During vaginal delivery,Breastfeeding,"Ans. C. During vaginal deliverya. Mothers, who are HIV infected can pass the virus on to their fetuses in utero or to infants via breast milk. Vaginal delivery is the most common and most effective mode of transmission.b. Perinatal transmission-The vertical transmission to neonates of the infected mothers is 25-35%. The baby may be affected in utero (30%) through transplacental transfer, during delivery (70-75%) by contaminated secretions and blood of the birth canal and through breast milk in neonatal period (10-20%).c. It is clear from recent European studies that Cesarean section alone, or in combination with antiretroviral therapy can affect an additional significant reduction in perinatal HIV transmission.d. These results support the conclusion that some HIV infection must be acquired during passage through the vaginal canal.e. In non-breast-feeding populations it is estimated that 50to70% of HIV infection is acquired during labor and delivery and the remainder in utero. To date, studies directed at reducing exposure to HIV during birth other than Cesarean section, have not demonstrated a benefit in reducing HIV transmission.",C
All of the following may be observed in a normal pregnancy EXCEPT:,Fall in serum iron concentration,Increase in serum iron binding capacity,Increase in blood viscosity,Increase in blood oxygen carrying capacity,"Blood thins out in pregnancy due to the hemodilution of pregnancy. The increase in Blood volume (30-45%) is relatively greater than that of red cell mass (20-30%) resulting in hemodilution and a decrease in haemoglobin concentration.

Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn is attributed to the deficiency of?,Vitamin A,Vitamin E,Vitamin K,Vitamin C,"Ans. (c) Vitamin K* Vitamin K is produced by our gut flora. The gut of a New-born baby is sterile and hence no vitamin K is being produced. Moreover vitamin k is negligible in breast milk. In lieu of these factors all babies are susceptible to development of Hemorrhagic disease of New-born.* To prevent this from happening therefore, as standard operating procedure in all hospitals injection vitamin K 1 : 1 mg intramuscular is given to prevent hemorrhagic disease of new born referred to as H.D.N.* In our country where a large number of children are born via home deliveries, no vitamin K would be given to the child and therefore the child may be brought to the hospital on day 5 with umbilical stump bleeding.* For management: the child should be given injection vitamin K lmg intravenously.

Not used in treatment of thalassemia:,Folic-acid,Iron therapy,Splenectomy,Bone marrow transplant,"Ans. b (Iron therapy). (Ref. Harrison, Principles of Medicine, 18th/Ch. 104)# Iron therapy is infact contraindicated in thalassemic patients on transfusion, as they are likely to have iron overload.Many patients with Beta-thalassemia major require chronic hypertransfusion therapy designed to maintain a hematocrit of at least 27-30% so that erythropoiesis is suppressed. Splenectomy is required if the annual transfusion requirement (volume of RBCs per kilogram of body weight per year) increases by >50%. Folic acid supplements may be useful. Vaccination with Pneumovax in anticipation of eventual splenectomy is advised, as is close monitoring for infection, leg ulcers, and biliary tract disease. Many patients develop endocrine deficiencies as a result of iron overload. Early endocrine evaluation is required for glucose intolerance, thyroid dysfunction, and delayed onset of puberty or secondary sexual characteristics.Patients with Beta-thalassemia intermedia exhibit similar stigmata but can survive without chronic hypertransfusion.Persons with alpha-thalassemia trait may exhibit mild hypochromia and microcytosis usually without anemia. HbA2 and HbF levels are normal. Affected individuals usually require only genetic counseling. HbH disease (in which three loci deleted on the contrary to Hb Barts, in which all four loci are deleted) resembles -thalassemia intermedia, with the added complication that the HbH molecule behaves like moderately unstable hemoglobin. Patients with HbH disease should undergo splenectomy if excessive anemia or a transfusion requirement develops. Oxidative drugs should be avoided. Iron overload leading to death can occur in more severely affected patients.",B

The advantages of hysterectomy in molar pregnancy are:,Chance of choriocarcinoma becomes nil,Follow up is not required,Enlarged ovaries can be removed during operation,Chance of pulmonary embolisation is minimal,"Hysterectomy when performed in molar pregnancy significantly decreases the chances of developing choriocarcinoma (by 5 fold times) but does not make it nil and hence follow up is required (so both options a and b are incorrect)

This is supported by following lines from Dutta-
“It should be remembered that following hysterectomy, persistent GTD is observed in 3–5% cases. As such, it does not eliminate the necessity of follow up.The enlarged ovaries (theca lutein cysts) found during operation should be left undisturbed as they will regress following removal of mole. But, if complication arises, like torsion, rupture or infarction, they should be removed.”
Dutta 7/e, p 195
Thus from above lines it is also clear that ovaries even if they are enlarged should not be removed during hysterectomy for h mole.
As far as pulmonary embolisation in concerned -acute pulmonary insufficiency due to pulmonary embolization of trophoblastic cells, is a complication seen with suction evaculation and not hysterectomy.",D

She is concerned about taking these medications now that she is pregnant.Which of the following is true regarding asthma medications in pregnancy:,B2 agonist are contraindicated during pregnancy.,Both B2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids are both contraindicated in pregnancy.,Both B2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids are safe in pregnancy,B2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids are both safe in pregnancy but during 2nd and 3rd trimester only,"Asthma in Pregnancy – Important Points:

Asthma is the most common chronic condition in pregnancy and affects 3–12% of gestations.
Effects of pregnancy on asthma: The course of the disease is very much unpredictable. In about 20%, the condition improves, in 30%, it deteriorates and in 50%, it remains unchanged.
It is more likely to deteriorate in women with severe asthma.
Exacerbations are most frequent between 24 to 36 weeks gestation and are most commonly precipitated by viral respiratory infections and non compliance with inhaled corticosteroid regimens.
Because asthma exacerbation can be severe, they should be treated aggressively in pregnancy.
Effects of asthma on pregnancy: Preterm labor PROM, preeclampsia, LBW baby and slight increase in abruptio placenta.
Severity of asthma correlates with FEV1 and PEFR (peak expiratory flow rate) FEV1 ideally is > 80% of the predicted value and PEFR FEV1 less than 1L or less than 20% of predicted value, correlates with severe disease.

Management of Asthma in Pregnancy:

Mild asthma: Inhaled beta agonist (albuterol preferred because of more human data on safety in pregnancy).
Mild persistent: Low dose inhaled corticosteroids (Budesonide preferred).
Moderate: Low dose inhaled corticosteroids and long acting b agonist (Salmetrol preferred).
Severe: High dose inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta agonist and oral steroids if needed.

Commonest presentation of sickle cell anemia ?,Priapism,Bone pain,Fever,Splenomegaly,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Bone pain Clinical manifestations of sickle cell anemia o The clinical manifestations of sickle cell anemia are - 1. Chronic hemolysis Irreversible sickle cells have rigid, nondeformable cell membranes that lead to difficulty in negotiating the splenic sinusoids, sequestration, and rapid phagocytosis. This results in extra-vascular hemolysis. Some intravascular hemolysis may also occur because of increased mechanical fragility of severely damaged cells. 2. Vasoocclusive symptoms Reversible sickle cells express higher than normal levels of adhesion molecules and are abnormally sticky that is responsible for occlusion of microcirculation especially of bones, lungs, spleen and penis.

hCG is secreted by: September 2010,Cytotrophoblast,Chorionic villi,Syncytiotrophoblast,None of the above,"Ans. C: Syncytiotrophoblast Human chorionic gonadotropin or human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone produced in pregnancy that is made by the developing embryo after conception and later by the syncytiotrophoblast (pa of the placenta). Its role is to prevent the disintegration of the corpus luteum of the ovary and thereby maintain progesterone production that is critical for a pregnancy in humans. Early pregnancy testing, in general, is based on the detection or measurement of hCG. Because hCG is produced also by some kinds of tumor, hCG is an impoant tumor marker especially (with clinical significance) in Gestational trophoblastic disease.",C

"A 28 yrs old lady, is suspected to have polycystic ovarian disease ,sample for testing LH and FSH are best taken on the following days of menstrual cycle",4-Jan,10-Aug,13-15,24-26,"In PCOD Determination of FSH and LH may help to confirm the diagnosis of poly cystic ovaries . These are assayed on the second or third day of cycle Lutenizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) LH and FSH are the hormones that encourage ovulation. Both LH and FSH are secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain. At the beginning of the cycle, LH and FSH levels usually range between about 5-20 mlU/ml. Most women have about equal amounts of LH and FSH during the early pa of their cycle. However, there is a LH surge in which the amount of LH increases to about 25-40 mlU/ml 24 hours before ovulation occurs. Once the egg is released by the ovary, the LH levels goes back down. While many women with PCOS still have LH and FSH still within the 5-20 mlU/ml range, their LH level is often two or three times that of the FSH level. For example, it is typical for women with PCOS to have an LH level of about 18 mlU/ml and a FSH level of about 6 mlU/ml (notice that both levels fall within the normal range of 5-20 mlU/ml). This situation is called an elevated LH to FSH ratio or a ratio of 3:1. This change in the LH to FSH ratio is enough to disrupt ovulation. While this used to be considered an impoant aspect in diagnosing PCOS, it is now considered less useful in diagnosing PCOS, but is still helpful when looking at the overall picture.

Allowing the cord blood passage to fetus before clamping the umbilical cord should be AVOIDED to prevent,Maternal alloimmunization,Prematurity,Growth retardation of fetus,All of the above,"Ans. a (Maternal alloimmunization) (Ref. Williams Obstetrics 22nd/Chapter 17; p. 431, 663)CLAMPING THE CORDThe umbilical cord is cut between two clamps placed 4 to 5 cm from the fetal abdomen, and later an umbilical cord clamp is applied 2 to 3 cm from the fetal abdomen. A plastic clamp that is safe, efficient, and fairly inexpensive.Timing of Cord ClampingIf after delivery, the newborn is placed at or below the level of the vaginal introitus for 3 minutes and the fetoplacental circulation is not immediately occluded by clamping the cord, an average of 80 mL of blood may be shifted from the placenta to the neonate. This provides about 50 mg of iron, which reduces the frequency of iron deficiency anemia later in infancy.Accelerated destruction of erythrocytes, as found with maternal alloimmunization, forms additional bilirubin from the added erythrocytes and contributes further to the danger of hyperbilirubinemia. Although the theoretical risk of circulatory overloading from gross hypervolemia is formidable, especially in preterm and growth-retarded neonates, the addition of placental blood to the otherwise normal newborn's circulation ordinarily does not cause difficulty.",A

True about scurvy is:,Skeletal changes in adults occur with deficiency of vitamin C.,Defective mineralization is the central cause of bone changes,Bowing of legs,Cailaginous overgrowth results in widening of the metaphyseal plate.,"Bowing of legs [Ref: Robbins 7/e p458; Nelson 18/c p251; Grainger Radiology 4/e p1942/ Scurvy results from a long-term deficiency of vitamin C. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, due to lack of the enzyme gulonolactone oxidase and therefore depend on dietary sources. Vitamin C is not stored in the body, but is taken up by all tissues; the highest levels are found in the pituitary and adrenal glands. This disorder occurs more frequently in children (paicularly infants) than in adults, and for the most pa, results from a diet of pasteurized or boiled milk. (This type of milk is deficient in vitamin C because the vitamin is inactivated by heat). For scurvy to develop, the deficiency must be present for a long time of approx. 4 to 6 months. Therefore it is unlikely that the disorder will be seen before the age of 4-6 months. The occurrence of scurvy in adults is rare, being seen mostly in patients suffering from chronic severe malnutrition. Vitamin C is essential for the hydroxylation of lysine and proline in collagen formation. The defect in collagen synthesis results in inadequate suppo of the walls of capillaries and venules leading to bleeding in the skin and in the gingival mucosa, haemahroses, and subperiosteal hemorrhages. The gums are swollen and bleed easily. Bleeding in the skin causes petechiae, eccyhmoses, perifollicular hemorrhages. Skeletal changes may also develop in infants and children. The pritnaly disturbance is in the formation of osteoid matrix, rather than in mineralization or calcification. (Rickets is characterized by the presence of excess osteoid and lack of calcification; whereas scurvy is associated with deficient osteoid and much calcified cailage). The potential for skeletal lesions diminish with increasing age. The skeletal changes are most pronounced in regions of active endochondral bone growth and therefore are best seen in the distal end of the long bones paicularly of the lower extremity. Changes at the sternal ends of the ribs cause scorbutic rosary formation. Key imaging features of scurvy or Vit. 'C' Def Osteoporosis White line of Frank! (irregular but thickened white line at the growth plate, it represents the zone of well-calcified cailage).

Wound and fracture healing is impaired due to derangement of collagen synthesis. Laboratory diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency is made on the basis of low plasma or leukocyte levels.",C

Which vitamin deficient is most commonly seen in a pregnant mother who is on phenytoin therapy for epilepsy?,Vitamin B6,Vitamin B12,Vitamin A,Folic acid,"Antiepileptic drugs interfere with metabolism of folate, and patients taking phenytoin may therefore become deficient in folate, leading to the development of macrocytic anemia and possible, complications during pregnancy.

This situation necessitates the careful monitoring of both folate and phenytoin levels after therapy is initiated. The normal range for folate is 5 to 25 ng/mL. Additionally, phenytoin therapy may increase the metabolism of vitamin D, leading to a decrease in vitamin D levels that can in turn cause alterations in calcium homeostasis that lead to osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Pregnant women taking phenytoin should receive the recommended 400 IU/day of cholecalciferol throughout pregnancy to prevent problems in vitamin D levels and calcium absorption.",D

Large tongue is common in,Turner syndrome,Treacher collins syndrome,Hypothyroidism,Congenital syphilis,"Oral manifestations of hypothyroidism : Childhood hypothyroidism known as cretinisim is characterized by thick lips, large protruding tongue (macroglossia), malocclusion and delayed eruption of teeth. Thickening of the lips and macroglossia is due to increased accumulation of subcutaneous mucopolysaccharides i.e., glycosaminoglycans due to decrease in the degradation of these substances. The long-term effects of severe hypothyroidism on craniofacial growth and dental development have also included impaction of the mandibular second molars. This seems to be caused by a dissociation of ramus growth and failure of normal resorption of the internal aspect of the ramus, resulting in insufficient space for proper eruption of these teeth. The common oral findings in hypothyroidism include the characteristic macroglossia, dysgeusia, delayed eruption, poor periodontal health, altered tooth morphology and delayed wound healing.Before treating a patient who has a history of thyroid disease, the dentist should obtain the correct diagnosis and etiology for the thyroid disorder, as well as past medical complications and medical therapy.

The MOST appropriate time for self-examination of breast in relation to menstraution in a pre-menopausal woman is?,A week after menstruation stas,Before ovulation,During menstruation,A day after menstruation ends,Breast self-examination is to be performed by all women above 18 years throughout their life. It should be performed every month at the same time of menstrual cycle. For pre-menopausal women: The best time is right after the menstrual cycle ends (7-10 day; after menstrual cycle stas) as at this time the breasts are less swollen and less tender a; estrogen levels are low. For post-menopausal women: BSE at any specific date can be selected for each month For women on H: BSE to be done after finishing each cycle of H For women on OCP: BSE should be performed with the sta of new pill pack each month,A
Commonest cause of ectopic pregnancy: March 2007,Previous tubal disease,Oral contraceptives,IUCD,Endometriosis,"Ans. A: Previous Tubal Disease Hair-like cilia located on the internal surface of the Fallopian tubes carry the feilized egg to the uterus. Damage to the cilia or blockage of the Fallopian tubes is likely to lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) increases the occurrence of ectopic pregnancy by 6-10 fold. This results from the build-up of scar tissue in the Fallopian tubes, causing damage to cilia. If however both tubes were occluded by PID, pregnancy would not occur and this would be protective against ectopic pregnancy. IUD increases the likelihood of tubal pregnancy by 7 times, should the pregnancy occurs with IUD in situ. Progestin only pill/postcoital estrogen preparations increases the risk due to impaired tubal motility. Tubal ligation can predispose to ectopic pregnancy. Reversal of tubal sterilization (Tubal reversal) carries a risk for ectopic pregnancy. A history of ectopic pregnancy increases the risk of future occurrences to about 10%. Ectopic pregnancy occasionally occurs in women who have had a hysterectomy. Women exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero (aka 'DES Daughters') also have an elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy, up to 3 times the risk of unexposed women.",A

Which of the following is a cause of Hirschsprung disease in a patient ?,Failure of migration of neural crest cells,Excessive peristalsis of the affected pa of the gut,Failure of involution of vitelline duct,Obstruction secondary to an infectious agent,"Hirschsprung's disease is due to defective neural crest cell migration from cecum to rectum resulting in congenital absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of the bowel wall Hirschsprung's disease - Hirschsprung disease, or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is a developmental disorder (neurocristopathy) of the enteric nervous system Pathophysiology - The enteric neuronal plexus develops from neural crest cells that migrate into the bowel wall during embryogenesis. Hirschsprung disease occurs when the normal migration of neural crest cells from cecum to rectum is disrupted. This produces a distal intestinal segment that lacks both the Meissner submucosal plexus and the Auerbach myenteric plexus ('aganglionosis'), and thus fails to develop coordinated peristaltic contractions Clinical features - Delayed passage of Meconium Bilious vomiting Abdominal distension Complications like Intestinal perforation and Rectal bleeding Diagnosis - A) Barium enema - Contracted involved segment become narrow Dilated normal proximal segment B) Intestinal Biopsy - gives definite diagnosis Absence of Ganglion cells Nerve trunk hyperophy Increased Acetylcholinesterase activity in involved segment Rx - Surgery (Surgical resection of involved segment f/b anastomosis of Normal segments)",A
"A 26 yr. old woman with a known case of mitral valve replacement done 2 years back for severe MS, currently on therapeutic anticoagulation with 5mg daily Warfarin, wants to conceive and has come for preconception counseling. All are true except:",The risk for warfarin embryopathy is around 6%,Warfarin should be stopped periconceptionally and switch over to heparin,Anticoagulation has to continue throughout pregnancy,The prognosis for her pregnancy depends on her NYHA class,"Ans. B. Warfarin should be stopped periconceptionally and switch over to heparinThe pregnancy outcome and prognosis of mitral stenosis is related to the functional capacity of the woman with the mortality rising considerably in the NYHA class III & IV group. Prognosis is also worsened when the mitral valve area is <2cm2. Therefore, pregnancy is contraindicated in these women and termination is advised. Such lesions should be treated, and cardiac status optimized before conceiving.Women who have undergone valve replacement are on therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin when they have a metallic valve in situ. Warfarin is the most effective for preventing maternal thromboembolic complications. But warfarin also leads to embryopathy, 6%, the risk being highest when the mean daily dose exceeded 5mg.Therefore, warfarin is stopped once pregnancy is confirmed and heparin is substituted till 12 weeks, following which warfarin is restarted for the remainder of pregnancy till 36 weeks. Warfarin is not recommended during labor as it can lead to post-partum hemorrhage.Beyond 36 weeks' heparin is started again because its effect can be controlled, it does not affect the synthesis of clotting factors and a specific antidote in the form of protamine sulfate is available. Heparin is also discontinued just before delivery.Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin or heparin may be restarted 6hr following vaginal delivery or 24hr after caesarean section.",B

Feature of Down syndrome is,18 trisomy,14/21 translocation,21 trisomy,Trisomy 13,"Ans) c (Trisomy 21) Ref Nelson 18th ed p 508Down syndrome is the most common chromosome disorder and the single most common genetic cause of moderate mental retardation. The incidence of Down syndrome in live births is approximately 1 in 750. The occurrence of trisomy 21 as well as other autosomal trisomies increases with advanced maternal age (> 35 yr)In approximately 95% of the cases of Down syndrome there are 3 copies of chromosome 21. The parental origin of the supernumerary chromosome 21 is maternal in 97% of the cases. Approximately 1 % of individuals are mosaics with some cells having 46 chromosomes, while another 4% of individuals have a translocation that involves chromosome 21.The majority of translocations in Down syndrome are fusions at the centromere between chromosomes 13, 14, 15, or 21, known as Robertsonian translocations. The translocations can be de novo or inherited.Down syndrome patients without a visible chromosome abnonnality are the least common.It is not possible to distinguish the phenotypes of individuals with full trisomy 21 and those with a translocation.Patients who are mosaic tend to have a milder phenotype.",C
Trans-Cervical Endometrial Resection (TCER) is used in A/E :,Endometriosis,DUB,Carcinoma endometrium,Submucous fibroid,"Ans. is b i.e. DUB Transcervical endometrial resection (Hysteroscopic endometrial ablation) is a technique for management of DUB. Aim of the procedure is to produce a therapeutic Asherman's syndrome and produce amenorrhea. It destroys the endometrium --4 formation of synchea Asherman syndrome --) amenorrhea. It is essential to destroy endometrial functionalis and basalis as well as 3mm of rnyometrial depth. Procedure : After appropriate inspection of the landmarks and endometrial cavity, a wire loop electrode is used to resect several strips of endornyometrium, to a depth of 4mm. Resected tissue is used for pathologic examination and documentation of the absence of cellular atypia. After a few strips are resected initially from the posterior uterine wall, resection of almost all the remaining surface with loop electrode by vaporisation is performed. The procedure should be performed soon after menstruation or the woman should be given progesterone. danazol or GnRH to suppress the endometrium. Result : Sho term and long term studies show amenorrhea rates of 20 - 50%, overall improved bleeding patterns (including amenorrhea) in 85 - 95%, with failure rates of 5 - 10% which requires additional surgery i.e. hysterectomy.

Medroxy progesterone acetate is given until bleeding stops. Progesterone and oral contraceptive pills both are used during episodes of bleeding and later to regularize and control menstrual bleeding. Oestrogen therapy alone yields very good results but is not recommended due to its high dose and side effects and is reserved only for emergency situations. Danazol is contraindicated in young girls as it causes hirsutism. In case hormone therapy fails, curettage of endometrium ican be done to rule out genital TB, (seen in 4% of these young girls) or presence of intrauterine clots. Use of GnRH analogues : 'For adolescent patients with coagulopathies or malignancy requiring chemotherapy, long term therapeutic amenorrhea with menstrual suppression using GnRH analogues can be achieved.' Other therapies : Desmopressin - synthetic analogue of vasopressin is given in case of Von Willebrand disease. In patients not responding to medical therapy - Mirena IUCD is inseed.

A 26-year old primigravida at 32 weeks of gestation experienced faintness and nausea in lying down and recovers after turning on her side or getting up. These symptoms can be attributed to which of the following,Reduced placental flow,Increased intragastric pressure,Increased intracranial pressure,Inferior vena caval compression,"Ans. d. Inferior vena caval compression Symptoms of faintness and nausea in lying down position and recovery after turning on the side or getting up in a 26-year old primigravida at 32 weeks of gestation can be attributed to inferior vena caval compression. 'Supine hypotensive syndrome is caused when the inferior vena cava is compressed by the weight of a pregnant female uterus, fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid while lying in the supine position. The condition can develop as early as the second trimester but is maximum during the third trimester. The patient experiences reduced blood pressure signs of shock such as cool, moist and clammy skin, tachycardia (early sign), bradycardia (very late sign), dizziness, syncope or near syncope, pedal edema, nausea, decreased femoral pulse and signs offetal distress. Supine hypotensive syndrome is easily managed by placing the patient in left lateral position Supine Hypotension Syndrome (Postural Hypotension) During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position.Q This, however, results in opening up of collateral circulation by means of paraveebral and azygous veins. In some cases (10%) when collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return to hea is seriously cuailed.Q This results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope.Q Turning patient to lateral position quickly restores the normal blood pressureQ. Can cause severe fetal distressQ The augmentation of venous return during uterine contraction prevents the manifestation from developing during labourQ.",D

"True statements regarding rape, incest, and abuse include which of the following?",Most rape victims are attractive women between 20 and 30 years of age,The chance that pregnancy will occur as a result of a rape is estimated to be about 25%,Approximately 2 to 4% of children are involved in incestual activity,Most cases of sexual abuse of a child involve family members,"Sexual assault happens to people of all ages. The mentally and physically handicapped and the very old are particularly susceptible. Victims of rape should always be treated as victims and at no time should the implication of guilt be applied to them. Psychological reaction to rape includes two phases: an immediate phase of paralysis of the coping mechanisms, usually lasting hours or days, followed by a more prolonged period of reorganization that may last months to years. The victim's menstrual history, birth control regimen, and known pregnancy status should be assessed at the initial examination. In the experience of most sexual assault centers, the chance that pregnancy will occur as a result of sexual assault is quite small and has been estimated to be approximately 2 to 4% for victims having a single unprotected coitus. If the patient has been exposed at midcycle, the risk would obviously be higher. 'Morning-after' prophylaxis using high-dose estrogens or oral contraceptives should be offered to unprotected rape victims. About 10% of all physically abused children are also sexually abused. Although the crime is underreported, it is estimated that about 336,000 children are sexually abused each year in the United States. Incestual activity may be experienced by as many as 15 to 25% of women and 12% of men. A family member is the sexual abuser of a child in about 80% of cases. Father-daughter incest accounts for about 75% of reported cases. A brother-sister relationship may be the most common type of incest but is reported less frequently.",D

For which of the following conditions screening for GDM is not required -,Previous macrosomia,Previous congenital malformation,Previous still born,Previous pre-eclampsia,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Previous preeclampsia Gestational diabetes mellitus It is defined as carbohydrate intolerance of varying severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Pregnancy is a form of stress that can cause latent diabetes to manifest just as do surgical operations or acute infections.In most of these cases the carbohydrate intolerance will revert by the end of puerperium but this manifestation may be the first indication of diabetes yet to come.More than half of the women with gestational diabetes will develop frank diabetes within the next 20 years.Screening and diagnosis for gestational diabetes mellitusHistorical risk factors suggestive of gestational diabetes have been known for a long timeUnexplained still birth, macrosomia. preterm birth Unexplained still birth, macrosomia and preterm birth have been consistently found to be significantly increased in both gestational and progestational diabetic pregnancies.H/O gestational diabetes in previous pregnancyH/O gestational diabetes in previous pregnancy or diabetes in a first degree relative also increase the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in subsequent pregnancies.Congenital malformationsCongenital malformations are associated with true diabetes. Congenital malformations are increased much more in known diabetics for obvious reasons because true gestational diabetes usually manifests in the second half of pregnancy by which time fetal organogenesis is nearly complete.The incidence of gestational diabetes can be stratified and shows good correlation with risk factors which can be utilized to characterize women into low average and high risk of developing gestational diabetes. Low risk categoryHigh risk category* <25 years of age* Markedly obese* Normal baby weight* H/o diabetes in first degree relative* No family history of diabetes * Previous abnormal glucose tolerance test* No history of abnormal glucose metabolism* Previous large baby >4 kg* No history of poor obstetric outcome* Previous bad obstetric history unexplained still birth or congenital malformed babies* Not members of an ethnic/racial group with a high prevalence of diabetes* Those with persistent glycosuria There has been a debate whether screening for diabetes should be universal or selective based on risk factors, or whether it is required at allAlthough there is ample evidence to demonstrate increased pregnancy and neonatal complications with increasing maternal glycemic levels there is not enough quality data to ascertain the impact of screening on maternal and neonatal health outcomes.In such a scenario the best policy seems to be is to offer selective screening based on race, personal and obstetric risk factors and the background prevalence of type 2 diabetics in the community.Also knowThe screening for gestational diabetes mellitus is routinely done at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy.Best screening test is 50 g glucose challenge test.",D

Some patients show hematuria and hypeension. Heavy proteinuria( more than 1g/metre square/day) is the underlying abnormality leading to hypoalbuminemia ( serum albumin below 2.5g/dl). The resultant fall in plasma oncotic pressure leads to interstitial edema and hypovolemia. This stimulates the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis and ADH secretion that enhances sodium and water retention. Hypoalbuminemia also induces hepatic synthesis of beta lipoproteins resulting in hypercholesterolemia. Main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is associated with minimal change disease. Other causes include amyloidosis, vasculitis, SLE, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and hepatitis B nephropathy. Steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome:- MCNS accounts for 80% cases of nephrotic syndrome. Electron microscopy shows non specific obliteration of epithelial foot processes.

Central apnea occurs when there is a lack of respiratory effort. This may result from central nervous system immaturity, or from the effects of medications or illness. Many episodes of apnea of prematurity may start as either obstructive or central, but then involve elements of both, becoming mixed in nature",A

Oral contraceptive acts by,Aseptic inflammation,Change in endometrial fluid,Foreign body reaction,Prevent ovulation,"Neither estrogen nor progestin hormone dose used in combination hormonal oral contraceptives alone would be able to suppress ovulation but together the estrogen and progestin hormones work synergistically to suppress ovulation 'successfully'. The synergistic antiovulatory effect from the combined use of estrogen and progestin directly decreases the secretion of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus and is considered the main action. This negative feedback mechanism disrupts ovulation by interfering with the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis and gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary. Specifically, the progestin component suppresses luteinizing hormone release and the LH surge, which is necessary for ovulation, and the estrogen component suppresses the follicle stimulating hormone, which prevents the selection and maturation of the dominant follicle.",D

An absence of diastolic flow is indicative of severe fetal compromise and requires intensive fetal monitoring with NST and frequent doppler upto 34 weeks or occurence of reversal of flow (whichever is earlier) after which pregnancy should be terminated. A reversal of diastolic flow is indicative of imminent fetal death (fetus is expected to die within 24-48 hours) requiring urgent termination, and therefore reversal occuring before lung maturity carries poor chances of fetal survival",D

Sacrospinous fixation is for strengthening:,Apical defect,Posterior defect,Lateral defect,Anterior defect,"Ans. A. Apical defecta. Sacrospinous ligament fixation: - The main indication for sacrospinous ligament fixation is to correct total procidentia or post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse with an associated weak cardinal uterosacral ligament complex and to correct post hysterectomy enterocele. The contraindication for the procedure is a short vagina.b. The principle of this procedure is the fixation of the vaginal vault to the sacrospinous ligament with nonabsorbable sutures. The fixation site is typically the right sacrospinous ligament. However, bilateral fixation is performed in patients with recurrent vault prolapse and with the goal of restoring a vaginal axis and sexual life. The routes of entry to the sacrospinous ligament may be posterior and anterior. Usually, a unilateral, right-sided, posterior approach is preferred.c. This procedure has advantages, including success rates comparable to abdominal procedures, the ability to repair concomitant pelvic floor defects, the absence of laparotomy, shorter hospital stays, and the preservation of vaginal length and function.d. The most common problem after this procedure is the high rate of postoperative cystocele, which approaches 20% to 33%, resulting from the deviation of the vaginal axis. Recurrent cystoceles have been reported in 6% to 92% of patients.e. Other disadvantages include difficulty in exposing the ligament, the potential need for excessive tensioning during tying, injury risk to the pudendal or inferior gluteal vessels and sciatic or pudendal nerve, alterations in the vaginal axis, and vaginal narrowing.f. Thomson et al have reported that by placing the sutures through the sacrospinous ligament 2.5cm more medially from the ischial spine along the superior border of the ligament and not through the full thickness of the ligament, the risk of complications is minimal.",A

Which among the following is the Most Common tumour associated with Neurofibromatosis in a child ?,Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Acute monocytic leukemia,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare form of blood cancer. JMML predominately affects young children, most often developing in children under the age of 4. The male/female ratio of affected children is 2-3:1. The disorder is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of an immature form of a specific type of white blood cell known as monocytes. These abnormal cells accumulate in the bone marrow crowding out other healthy cells. The bone marrow produces specialized cells (hematopoietic stem cells) that grow and eventually develop into red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. These cells are released into the bloodstream to travel throughout the body and perform specific functions. Red blood cells deliver oxygen to the body; white blood cells help the body to fight infection; and platelets allow the body to form clots to stop bleeding. When abnormal cells accumulate in the bone marrow, they can affect the production and function of these healthy blood cells. JMML cells can accumulate in other organs of the body including the lungs, skin, liver, and intestines. JMML is an aggressive and difficult to treat disease but is currently cured in about 50% of cases. Currently, the only effective treatment for most patients is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The exact, underlying causes of JMML are unknown, but nearly all patients will have a mutation that changes the DNA inside their blood cells in a RAS gene or in a gene that controls the activation levels of Ras proteins. With an incidence of 1 in 3000, NF1 is the most common familial cancer syndrome. Affected persons develop multiple noncancerous (benign) tumors of the nerves and skin (neurofibromas) and areas of decreased or increased coloration of the skin. Cafe-au-lait spots are common in neurofibromatosis type 1. However, many of these findings may not be present in very young children. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

The coagulation profile in a 13-year old girl with Menorrhagia having von Willebrands disease is ?,Isolated prolonged PTT with a normal PT,Isolated prolonged PT with a normal PTT,Prolongation of both PT and PTT,Prolongation of thrombin time,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Isolated prolonged PTT with a normal PT Von Willebrand's factor acts as a plasma carrier of factor VIII and circulates in the blood as factor VIII-VWF complex. Its deficiency therefore impairs the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and prolongs the PTT as the intrinsic pathway of coagulation remains unimpaired, PT is not altered. i) Bleeding time It is a not a test for coagulation rather it tests the ability of the vessels to vasoconstrict and the platelets to form a hemostatic plug. o It is the time taken for a standardized skin puncture to stop bleeding. o Normal reference value is between 2-9 minutes. Prolongation generally indicates the defect in platelet number or function. ii) Prothrombin time (PT) o This assay tests the extrinsic and common coagulation pathway. So, a prolonged PT can result from deficiency of factor V, VII, X, prothrombin or fibrinogen. iii) Paial thromboplastin time (PTT) o This assay tests the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways. So, a prolonged PTT. Can results from the deficiency of factor V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, prothrombin or fibrinogen. iv) Thrombin time It is the time taken for clotting to occur when thrombin is added to the plasma. o It tests the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and depends on adequate fibrinogen level. o Prolonged thrombin time results from decreased level of fibrinogen.",A

True about Meig's syndrome ;,Lymphatic dysplasia,2 - 30 years age,Associated with ascites and pleural effusion and No treatment required,None.,"Ans. is c i.e. Associated with ascites and pleural effusion; and No treatment required Ascites and right sided hydrothorax in association with fibroma of ovary is called as Meig's syndrome. It can also be seen in Brenner's tumour and Granulosa cell tumour where it is called as Pseudomeig's syndrome. Hydrothorax can be bilateral also. True meig's syndrome is rare, occuring in < 5 per cent of fibromas. Ascites is caused by transudation of fluid from the ovarian fibroma. Hydrothorax develops secondary to flow of ascitic fluid into the pleural space lymphatics of the diaphragm. Ascites occurs (in 50% cases) when tumour size is > 6 cms. Tumours producing Meig's syndrome manifest in the late childbearing period i.e., 30 - 40 years. Both ascites and hydrothorax resolve spontaneously after removal of the tumour. Criteria for diagnosis of Meig's syndrome : Tumour must be ovarian, solid and benign. Both hydrothorax and ascites must be present. Removal of the tumour must result in their spontaneous and permanent cure. Pseduomeig syndrome : Can be seen in association with either benign or malignant tumour. Hydrothorax could be a manifestation of pulmonary metastasis. Syndrome can result from overstimulation of the ovaries with gonadotropins but, in such cases, the peritoneal exudate is more likely to be caused by an electrolyte imbalance rather than by ovarian tumour.",C

False about paial mole,Caused by triploidy,Can be diagnosed very early by USG,Can present as missed aboion,Rarely causes persistent GTD,"Ans. is b i.e. can be diagnosed very early by USG Paial moles Paial moles or incomplete molar pregnancy means that along with the hydatidiform changes some element of fetal tissue is present They have a triploid karyotype (69 chromosomes)deg, the extra haploid set of chromosomes usually is derived from the fatherdeg. Characteristic pathological features of paial mole Chorionic villi of varying sizes with focal hydatiform swelling, cavitation and trophoblastic hyperplasia Marked villous scalloping Prominent stromal trophoblastic inclusions Identifiable embryonic or fetal tissue. Clinical features -- hey generally do not have the dramatic clinical features characteristic of complete pt general these patients have the signs and symptoms of incomplete or missed aboion, and paial mole can be diagnosed after histologic review of tissue obtained by curettage'. Features like hyperemesis, hypehyroidism and Theca lutein cysts are rare in paial mole. Prognosis 'The risk of persistent trophoblastic disease after a paial mole is substancially lower than following a complete molar pregnancy. Moreover, persistent disease is seldom a choriocarcinoma.' The risk of persistent trophoblastic disease in a case of paial mole is 1-5% wherease with complete mole, it is 15-20% Hence option d i.e. it rarely causes persistent trophoblatic disease is paially correct Diagnosis -- of paial mole by USG is not that easy as is in the case of complete mole because it does not give the characteristic vesicular & ultrasonographic appearance like a complete mole. 'Sonographic features of a paial mole include a thickened, hydropic placenta with fetal tissue. Impoantly, in early pregnancy, sonographv will demon t te the rho raeristic appearance in as few as third of women with a paial mole' ... Williams Obs 23/ed pg-260 Hence Option b i.e. it can be diagnosed very early by USG is incorrect Remember - - The USG criteria for diagnosis of paial mole is Presence of focal cystic areas in the placental tissues . Increase in transverse diameter of gestational sac. The combination of above two criterias have a positive predictive value of 90% for paial moles . (This means USG can diagnose paial mole but not in early pregnancy) The nonble fetus associated with a triploid paial mole typically has multiple malformations, like syndactyly and hydrocephaly and have symmetrical growth retardation. 13 hcg levels > 200 m IU/rni, after evacuation of paial mole in the third through the eighth week are associated with a 35% risk of persistent trophoblastic disease. Extra edge The most significant recent development in the pathological analysis of H. mole is the use of P57kip2 immunostaining to make a definitive diagnosis of androgenetic complete H. Mole as opposed to an hydropic aboion or a paial mole. P57kip2 is a paternally imprinted gene. which is maternally expressed. The absence of maternal genes in androgenetic complete mole means that the gene cannot be expressed in a complete mole cytotrophoblast Hence V kip2 staining is negative in complete mole in contrast to paial moles, hydropic aboion & normal placenta. This technique is well validated, easy and inexpensive to perform.",B

In familial cases of ovarian cancer, the cancers tend to appear at a younger age, but are thought to possibly have, on an average, a slightly better prognosis than do isolated cases. Families with multiple cases of breast cancer due to genetic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 also have an increased incidence of ovarian cancers. The BRCA1 mutation is paicularly virulent, and up to 30-40% of women with this mutation develop ovarian cancer. (There are also families in which the women have a BRCA1 mutation and develop ovarian, but not breast cancer at an increased rate). Another cancer syndrome, the Lynch II syndrome (also known as the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome), is also associated with ovarian cancer (and cancers of the uterus, breast, stomach, and pancreas). In both the breast cancer families and the Lynch II families, the genetic pattern seen is usually autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Prophylactic oophorectomy is often offered women in cancer families who have reached the age of 35 and have had their children.

Benefits of breast milk are –,Better nutrition,Less infection,Less allergy,All of these,"Breast feeding

Breast feeding is feeding an infant or young child with breast milk directly from breast and not from a baby bottle or other container.
Under any circumstances, breast milk is the ideal food for the infant —> Human breast milk is the best source of nourishment for human infants.
No other food is required by the baby until the age of 6 months after birth.
So, exclusive breast feeding should be given to infant for first 6 months of life.

Benefits of breast feeding

Among the benefits of breast feeding are the following -

Superior nutrition
Carbohydrates

Lactose is in a high concentration in breast milk which helps in the absorption of calcium and enhances the growth of lactobacilli in the intestine.

Proteins

The protein content of breast milk is low which causes lower solute load on the kidney.
Most of the protein is whey proteins (lactalbumin and lactoglobulin), which can be digested easily (In contrast cow milk contains more casein).
Breast milk contains the ideal ratio of the amino acids cysteine, taurine and methionine to support the development of the central and peripheral nervous system.

Fats


Breast milk is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, necessary for the myelination of the nervous system and brain growth.
Active lipase in the breast milk promotes digestion of fats and provides FFA.
The pattern of fats facilitates the absorption of calcium.

Minerals

Breast milk protects against neonatal hypocalcemia and tetany due to ideal calcium phosphorus ratio (2:1) and better calcium absorption.
Iron of breast milk is very well absorbed → breast feeding prevents against iron deficiency anemia.
Breast milk also prevents deficiencies of vitamin A, C, D, E and zinc.
Breast milk has a water content of 88% and hence a breastfed baby does not require additional water in the first 6 months of life even in summer months.
Breast milk has a low mineral and sodium content → low osmolality presents a low solute load to the kidney.

Lower risk of infection

The breast milk is clean and uncontaminated with several anti-infective factors → protect the baby from infection and diarrhoea

Protection from allergy (atopy)

Low protein contents of breast milk along with a higher concentration of secretory IgA decreases the absorption of protein macromolecules → less chances of allergy and asthma.

Emotional bonding

Breast feeding promotes close physical and emotional bonds between the mother and the baby.

Others

Breast feeding lowers the risk of ovarian and breast cancer in mother.
Breastfed babies have a higher IQ and have less chances of developing hypertension, obesity, coronary artery disease and diabetes in their adulthood.
The other diseases which are less common in breastfed babies include inflammatory bowel disease, Hodgkin's lymphoma, necrotizing enterocolitis and sudden infant death syndrome.",D

Which of the following is consistent with a diagnosis of delayed puberty?,Breast budding in a 10-year-old girl,Menarche delayed beyond 16 years of age,Menarche 1 year after breast budding,FSH values less than 20 mIU/mL,"Significant emotional concerns develop when puberty is delayed. By definition, if breast development has not begun by age 13, delayed puberty should be suspected. Menarche usually follows about 1 to 2 years after the beginning of breast development; if menarche is delayed beyond age 16, delayed puberty should be investigated. Appropriate laboratory tests include circulating pituitary and steroid hormone levels, karyotypic analysis, and central nervous system (CNS) imaging when indicated. An FSH value greater than 40 mIU/mL defines hypergonadotropic hypogonadism as a cause of delayed pubertal maturation. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is seen in girls with gonadal dysgenesis, such as occurs with Turner syndrome. Since gonadal dysgenesis is such a common cause of absent pubertal development, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is frequently but not invariably found in these patients.",B

The adolescent shown presents with a 14-day history of multiple oval lesions over his back. The rash began with a single lesion over the lower abdomen (A); the other lesions developed over the next days (B). These lesions are slightly pruritic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Contact dermatitis,Pityriasis rosea,Seborrheic dermatitis,Lichen planus,"(b) Source: (Hay et al, p 397. Kliegman et al, p 2262. McMillan et al, pp 839-840. Rudolph et al, p 1262.) Pityriasis rosea is a benign condition that usually presents with a herald patch, a single round or oval lesion appearing anywhere on the body. Usually about 5 to 10 days after the appearance of the herald patch, a more diffuse rash involving the upper extremities and trunk appears. These lesions are oval or round, slightly raised, and pink to brown in color. The lesion is covered in a fine scale with some central clearing possible. The rash can appear in a Christmas tree pattern on the back, identified by the aligning of the long axis of the lesions with the cutaneous cleavage lines. The rash lasts 2 to 12 weeks and can be pruritic. This rash is commonly mistaken for tinea corporis, and the consideration of secondary syphilis is important.Treatment is usually unnecessary but can consist of topical emollients and oral antihistamines, as needed. More uncommonly, topical steroids can be helpful if the itching is severe. Lichen planus is rare in children. It is intensely pruritic, and additional lesions can be induced with scratching. The lesion is commonly found on the flexor surfaces of the wrists, forearms, inner thighs, and occasionally on the oral mucosa. Seborrheic dermatitis can begin anytime during life; it frequently presents as cradle cap in the newborn period. This rash is commonly greasy, scaly, and erythematous and, in smaller children, involves the face, neck, axilla, and diaper area. In older children, the rash can be localized to the scalp and intertriginous areas. Pruritus can be marked. Contact dermatitis is characterized by redness, weeping, and oozing of the affected skin. The pattern of distribution can be helpful in identification of the offending agent. The rash can be pruritic; removal of the causative agent and use of topical emollients or steroids is curative. Psoriasis consists of red papules that coalesce to form plaques with sharp edges. A thick, silvery scale develops on the surface and leaves a drop of blood upon its removal (Auspitz sign). Additional lesions develop upon scratching older lesions. Commonly affected sites include scalp, knees, elbows, umbilicus, and genitalia.",B

"In a small child diagnosed with H.influenza meningitis, what investigation must be done before discharging him from the hospital ?",BERA,MBI,CT scan,X-ray skull,"Clinical description : Bacterial meningitis is characterized by acute onset of fever (usually > 38.5 degC rectal or 38.0 degC axillary), headache and one of the following signs: neck stiffness, altered consciousness or other meningeal signs. Hib, meningococcal meningitis and pneumococcal meningitis cannot be differentiated on clinical grounds alone Laboratory criteria for diagnosis Bacterial meningitis can be confirmed by three methods. (1) Culture method: isolation of a bacterial pathogen from a normally sterile clinical specimen such as CSF or blood. (2) Antigen detection methods: identification of a bacterial antigen in normally sterile fluids (i.e. CSF or blood) by such methods as latex agglutination or counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE). (3) Gram stain results Case classification Suspected: Any person with sudden onset of fever (> 38.5 degC rectal or 38.0 degC axillary) and one of the following signs: neck stiffness, altered consciousness or other meningeal sign Probable: A suspected case with CSF examination showing at least one of the following: - turbid appearance; - leukocytosis (> 100 cells/mm3); - leukocytosis (10-100 cells/ mm3) AND either an elevated protein (> 100 mg/dl) or decreased glucose (< 40) Confirmed: A case that is laboratory-confirmed by growing (i.e. culturing) or identifying (i.e. by Gram stain or antigen detection methods) a bacterial pathogen (Hib, pneumococcus or meningococcus) in the CSF or from the blood in a child with a clinical syndrome consistent with bacterial meningitis. Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) constitutes 1.5% of all admissions in the pediatric ward with a mean case fatality of 16%. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common neuropsychological sequel of ABM. It occurs in as many as 30% of patients with pneumococcal meningitis, 10% with meningococcal meningitis and 5-20% with Haemophilus influenzae type &;b&; meningitis.The effect of SNHL on language is well-recognized and therefore early detection is mandatory. However, hearing assessment is difficult in infants and young children. Brainstem evoked response audiometry (BERA) can help to assess hearing in this population. BERA is a helpful tool for screening of SNHL, especially in the young children and infants in whom other conventional methods may not be of much use. There is significantly increased risk of developing SNHL if the CSF has increased cells, paicularly polymorphs and proteins. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

Indicators of impending uterine rupture durine labour include all of the following except :,Fetal distress,Hematuria,Fresh bleeding per vaginum,Passage of meconium,"Ans. is d i.e. Passage of meconium Features of Rupture uterus Impending rupture : Abdominal pain Slight vaginal bleeding Fetal distress as evidenced by abnormal FHR, bradycardia and variable and late declerations. Tenderness in uterine palpation Complete rupture : Sense of something giving away Collapse, shock, dehydration Absent FHS Palpation of superficial pas Shoening of cord immediately following a difficult vaginal delivery is pathognomonic of uterine rupture. So it is clear that fetal distress and vaginal bleeding may be seen in impending uterine rupture. Now we are left with 2 options: Hematuria and passage of meconium 'There are no reliable signs of impending uterine rupture that occurs hpfnre labor, although the sudden appearance of gross hematuria is suggestive' ...COGDT 10/e p 340. Thus. hematuria can be seen in impending rupture. Though some of you may argue that passage of meconium is a sign of fetal distress, it should not be ruled out but here I would like to say--lets think as a clinician if we have a patient with previous LSCS in whom there is passage of meconium, obviously it will not mean that patient is going to have impending rupture. it means the fetus is in distress which can be due to any reason. Also remember: Spontaneous rupture of uterus during pregnancy occurs in upper segment. Spontaneous non obstructive rupture during labour occurs in upper segment - Fundus. Spontaneous obstructive rupture during labour occurs in lower segment. Most common sign of uterine rupture is non reassuring FHR pattern with variable hea rate decelerations that may evolve into late decelerations.

Most likely diagnosis is:",Concealed abruptio,Battledore placenta,Vasa previa,Placenta accreta,"Ans. is c, i.e. Vasa previaHere patient presents to labor room in labor. The moment ARM is done fresh bleeding is seen late declarations are seen (i.e. there is fetal distress) and fetus could not be saved.There is no placenta previa or abruptio. This points out towards vasa previa as diagnosis because in vasa previa, umbilical cord is attached to membranes. The moment ARM is done, along with membranes, cord is also ruptured which leads to fetal blood loss, fetal distress and ultimately fetal death.",C

The commonest cause of intestinal obstruction in children between 3 months to 6 years of age,Intussusception,Meckel's diverticulum,Intestinal polyp,Nonspecific cause,"Ans. a (Intussusception) (Ref. Nelson paediatrics, p. 1569)INTUSSUSCEPTION# Intussusception occurs when a portion of the alimentary tract is telescoped into an adjacent segment. It is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction between 3 mo and 5 yr of age.# Sixty percent of patients are younger than 1 yr, and 80% of the cases occur before 24 mo: it is rare in neonates.# The incidence varies from 1 to 4/1,000 live births.# The male:female ratio is 4:1. A few intussusceptions reduce spontaneously, but if left untreated, most will lead to intestinal infarction, perforation, peritonitis, and death.Etiology and Epidemiology# The cause of most intussusceptions is unknown.# The seasonal incidence has peaks in spring and autumn.# Correlation with prior or concurrent respiratory adenovirus (type C) infection has been noted, and the condition may complicate otitis media, gastroenteritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura.# The risk of intussusceptions in infants <1 yr of age after receiving a no longer available tetravalent rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine within 2 wk of immunization was increased.# Lymphoid nodular hyperplasia is another related risk factor. Prominent mounds of lymph tissue lead to mucosal prolapse of the ileum into the colon, thus causing an intussusception.# In 2-8% of patients, recognizable lead points for the intussusception are found, such as a Meckel diverticulum, intestinal polyp, neurofibroma, intestinal duplication, hemangioma, or malignant conditions such as lymphoma. Intussusception can complicate mucosal hemorrhage, as in Henoch-Schonlein purpura or hemophilia.# Cystic fibrosis is another risk factor.# Postoperative intussusception is ileoileal and usually occurs within 5 days of an abdominal operation.# Lead points are more common in children >2 yr of age.Pathology# Intussusceptions are most often ileocolic, less commonly cecocolic, and rarely exclusively ileal.Clinical manifestations# Spasmodic intermittent abdominal pain;# 'Red currant' jelly stools# Palpable lump.# Dance sign, n 'Empty RIF' signDiagnosis# Ultrasound is investigation of choice.# Ba enema is now 2nd line investigation# USG signs:- 'Doughnut or target' appearance in transverse images.- 'Sandwich or hamburger' sign in longitudinal images- Pseudokidney sign# Ba emema signs:- 'Claw'sign- 'Coiled-spring' signRx# Hydrostatic reduction# Air reduction is associated with fewer complications and lower radiation exposure than traditional contrast hydrostatic techniques.# The success rate of radiologic hydrostatic reduction under fluoroscopic or ultrasonic guidance is =50% if symptoms are present longer than 48 hr and 70-90% if reduction is done in the 1st 48 hr.# If manual operative reduction is impossible or the bowel is not viable, resection of the intussusceptions is necessary with end-to-end anastomosis.# Corticosteroids may reduce the frequency of recurrent intussusception.",A

"Shoulder dystocia is suspected during a delivery after the delivery of the head, obstetrician asks the assistants to sharply flex the legs towards the abdomen. What is this maneuver?",McRobes maneuver,Rubin's maneuver,Wood Corkscrew maneuver,Zavanelli's maneuver,"The McRobes maneuverThe maneuver consists of removing the legs from the stirrups and sharply flexing the thighs up toward the abdomen. The procedure caused straightening of the sacrum relative to the lumbar veebrae, rotation of the symphysis pubis toward the maternal head, and a decrease in the angle of pelvic inclination. Although this does not increase pelvic dimensions, pelvic rotation cephalad tends to free the impacted anterior shoulder.Of rotational maneuvers, Woods (1943) repoed that by progressively rotating the posterior shoulder 180 degrees in a corkscrew fashion, the impacted anterior shoulder could be released. This is frequently referred to as the Wood's corkscrew maneuver. Rubin (1964) recommended two maneuvers. First, the fetal shoulders are rocked from side to side by applying force to the maternal abdomen. If this is not successful, the pelvic hand reaches the most easily accessible fetal shoulder, which is then pushed toward the anterior surface of the chest. This maneuver most often abducts both shoulders, which in turn produces a smaller bisacromial diameter. This permits displacement of the anterior shoulder from behind the symphysis With an all- fours maneuver , also called the Gaskin maneuver, the paurient rolls onto her knees and hands. Here, downward traction against the head and neck attempts to free the posterior shoulder The Zavanelli maneuver involves replacement of the fetal head into the pelvis followed by cesarean delivery Reference: William's obstetrics; 25th edition",A

Friends, Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is an impoant and emerging topic for PGME exams. It is one of the least touched topic at undergraduate level. Therefore, I am explaining it in detail. Do go through it : Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome : It is a treatable, autoimune disorder associated with recurrent second trimester pregnancy loss.deg Antiphospholipid antibodies are acquired antibodies targeted against a phospholipid. They can be IgM, IgG or IgA isotopes. Most impoant antiphospholipid antibodies are : Lupus anticoagulant (LAC) -- It was named so because it was first found in patients with SLE & prolonged paial thromboplastin time -- But the name is a misomer as though it increases PTT (i.e., similar to anticoagulant) but functions as a procoagulant & causes thrombosis Anticardiolipin antibody - It is most commonly seen in patients with repetitive early pregnancy loss BFP - ST i.e. antibody which causes biologically false positive syphilis test -- Less common antiphospholipid antibody - Both anticardio lipin & BFPST antibodies measure the antibody against cardiotipin but they are not same. Diagnosis For diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome there should be two positive tests 6 weeks apa for lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibody. Mqrpclerrient 7 Treatment as proposed by ACOG is a combination of low dose aspirin (81 mg) daily and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in prophylactic doses (e.g. dalteparin 5000 units S/C twice daily), staed as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Aspirin can be initiated preconceptionaly and is usually discontinued at 36 weeks. LMWH is continued up to term and for 5 days postpaum. Women with previous history of thrombosis will usually already be on maintenance therapy with warfarin. In such cases as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, warfarin is changed to LMWH and aspirin. Although this treatment improves overall pregnancy success, these women remain at high risk for preterm labor, PROM. IUGR. preeclampsia and placental abruption.

Germinomas usually can be cured using chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Ninety percent of germ cell tumors are gonadal, which means they begin in the reproductive cells of the testes (testicular tumors) or ovaries (ovarian tumors). Germ cell tumors that appear in other pas of the body - including the abdomen, chest, neck, head and brain (the areas where the cells migrate within a developing embryo) - are called extragonadal germ cell tumors. The most common types of malignant germ cell tumors are dysgerminomas >immature teratomas>endodermal sinus tumors.

Treatment modalities: Medical treatment, antimicrobial Minimal invasive surgery Major surgery Management: Rest Intravenous fluids in the presence of dehydration or vomiting and correction of electrolyte imbalance Analgesics, once the diganosis is confirmed Antibiotics- Because of the damaging effect of gonococci and Chlamydia on the fallopian tubes and poly microbial nature of infection, it is mandatory to institute antibiotic therapy at the earliest and not wait for the culture results. First-line therapies: Cefoxitin (2 gm intravenously every 6 hours) or cefotetan (2gm IV every 12 hours) plus doxycycline (100mg orally every 12 hours) Because of the pain associated with intravenous infusion, doxycycline should be administered orally when possible. Oral and IV administration of doxycycline provide similar bioavailability. Placentrex (aqeous extract of thr fresh placenta) 1 ml intramuscularly daily or alternate days (total of 10 injections) has multipronged anti-inflammatory action. It also causes tissue regeneration, wound healing, and has significant immunotropic action involving both humoral and cellular immunity however it is outdated and not used currently. Paner should be investigated and treated There is no need to remove IUCD if the woman responds to antibiotics; failed response calls for its removal.

Cellulitis presents clinically as an area of edema, warmth, erythema, and tenderness. The lateral margins tend to be indistinct because the process is deep in the skin, primarily involving the subcutaneous tissues in addition to the dermis. Application of pressure may produce pitting. Although distinction cannot be made with ceainty in any paicular patient, cellulitis as a result of S. aureus tends to be more localized and may suppurate, whereas infections due to S. pyogenes (group A streptococcus) tend to spread more rapidly and may be associated with lymphangitis.

What is the ideal treatment for a 55-years-female with Simple hyperplasia of the endometrium with Atypia?,Simple hysterectomy,Medroxy progesterone acetate (MPA),Levonorgesterol (LNG),IUCD,"Management of Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia:
'Hysterectomy is the best treatment for women at any age with atypical endometrial hyperplasia because the risk of concurrent subclinical invasive disease is high.'
Williams Gynae 1st ed p 691
'In presence of atypia, response to progesterone therapy is poor and the relapse rate is high. Nearly one-third of them will progress to cancer and one-fourth may already have associated undiagnosed cancer. In women approaching or post menopause, hysterectomy is a safer choice in those with complex or atypical hyperplasia.'  
Jeffcoate 7th/ ed p 425
So Remember: Best management of atypical hyperplasia is hysterectomy.
Also, Know Management of Endometrial Hyperplasia:
Management depends on the patient's age and the presence or absence of cytological atypia.
Non-atypical hyperplasia:

Premenopausal women: Progesterone therapy-

options: - Medroxyprogesterone acetate for 21 days a month daily for 3 months.
Progesterone-containing IUCD.
Postmenopausal women

Simple hyperplasia without atypia - Generally followed without therapy.
Complex hyperplasia without atypia - Cyclical/continuous progesterone therapy.
These patients should be followed annually by endometrial biopsy.


Atypical hyperplasia:

The ideal treatment is a hysterectomy
Premenopausal women willing to preserve fertility - High dose progesterone therapy after full information of risk of undiagnosed cancer or progression to cancer. In these cases periodic TVS and endometrial biopsy is necessary.",A
Which of the following is dangerous placenta?,Type I,Type II anterior,Type II posterior,Type III,"Ans: c (Type II posterior) Ref:Dutta, 6th ed, p. 245Dangerous placenta is the name given to Type II posterior placenta praevia. In type II posterior placenta praevia the major thickness of placenta overlies the sacral promontory, thereby diminishing the anteroposterior diameter of inlet and prevents engagement of the presenting part. This hinders effective compression of the separated placenta to stop bleeding.Different types of placenta praeviaType 1 (low lying) - major part of placenta is attached to the upper segment and only the lower margin encroaches on to the lower segment but not upto the os.Type 2 (marginal) - The placenta reaches the margin of the internal os but does not cover it. It is divided into anterior and posterior.Type 3 (incomplete or partial centre) - placenta covers the internal os partially (covers the internal os) when the os is closed but does not entirely do when fully dilated.Type 4 (central or total) - placenta completely covers the internal os even after it is fully dilated.For clinical purpose placenta praevia are graded into mild degree which includes Type I and Type II anterior and major degree which include Type II posterior. Type III and Type IV.Stallworthy sign:Slowing of fetal heart rate on pressing the head down into the pelvis which soon recovers promptly as the pressure is released is suggestive of low lying placenta specially posterior typeDangerous placenta previa-Type IIBAt 20 wks - 30% of placenta are low lyingAt term - only 2% of placenta are low lyingPlacenta praeviaSymptoms- Painless bleeding Warning haemorrhagesO/E- Malpresentation- Floating head- FHS present - Stall Worthy signInvestigationUSG- (TVS)- Colour Doppler- MRIClinical confirmation - Double setup examination.

"Risk factors for the development of breast cancer include all of the following, EXCEPT:",Early menarche,Bearing first child after the age of 35,Positive family history of breast cance,Multiparous women,"The anti-estrogenic action produced by progesterone may be responsible for a reduction of the incidence of breast cancer in multiparous women. Hyperestrinism is the key factor that enhances predisposition of the development of breast cancer. Use of oral contraceptives or estrogen replacement therapy for postmenopausal symptoms for a period of 5-10 years does not significantly increase the chances of development of breast cancer. However, prolonged use of estrogen in excess of ten years may increase the chance of development of breast cancer. Chances are higher in women with other known risk factors such as a family history of breast cancer.",D

'Histopathology also reveals lobular panniculitis characterized by patchy infiltrates of lymphocytes, histiocytes and multinueleated giant cells'. (Panniculitis Inflammation of the subcutaneous, fat) Physical panniculitis Panniculitis that occurs. from physical factors Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn - It is a lobular panniculitis - It occurs in full term or post term healthy infants typically at 1-6 weeks of life or soon thereafter. - The lesion consists of one or small number of finn, nontender, erythematous nodules or plaques on the face buttocks, and or extremities. - The nodules may often break down and discharge oily material. - Over the next.few weeks or month the nodules resolve spontaneously. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is complicated by hypercalcemia - Hypercalcemia is the only significant complication and founately it occurs in minority of patients. - Manifestations of hypercalcemia include irritability. failure to thrive, hypeonia, nausea, vomiting. Pathogenesis is unknown with several hypotheses -The etiology of subcutaneous .fat necrosis is unknown but in some patients., bih trauma, asphyxia, difficult labour or hypothermia have been noted. - Perhaps diffuse tissue hypoxia predisposes to these conditions. Some believe that it occurs because of the differences in the composition of fatty acids. - In contrast to adult. fat, the subcutaneous fat of infants is thought to prone to crystal formation because of a higher content of saturated fatty acid including palmitic acid and stearic acid, and lower content of unsaturated fatty acid such as oleic acid. - The increased saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio results in higher melting point for stored fat and promotes crystallization. Treatment - Treatment will not he required as the lesion will resolve - Most infants have resolution of the lesion within 1-2 in - Parents should be reassured of the benign nature of this - They should be educated about the sign and symptoms o - Serum calcium should be measured whenever symptoms Post setorid panniculitis It is rare .form of panniculitis, occurs predominantly coicosteroids during rapid coicosteroid withdraw'. coicosteroid therapy. Firm subcutaneous nodules begin to appear within a month of tapering of the coicosteroids. Areas of abundant subcutaneous fat are oured i.e. cheek, trunks, proximal extremities. Most cases resolve spontaneously but if severe, the steroids must be reinstituted and tapered more slowly. Histologically the changes are identical to those seen in subcu- taneous fat necrosis of the newborn -There is a lobular panniculitis with necrosis of adipocytes and needle shaped clefts in both adipocytes and histiocytes. Foamy histiocytes are also present. - It was believed that the withdrawl of coicosteroids therapy leads to abnormal lipid metabolism resulting in the elevation of saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio. Sclerema Neonataram Sclerema neonatarum is much less common than subcutaneous fat necrosis but much serious and life threatening. It affects preteen and term baby. In this entity premature or term babies, develop, rapidly progressive diffuse nonedematous hardening of subcutaneous tissue beginning on the trunk or buttocks and extending to the entire body surface area. These infants have difficulty in maintaining body temperature with recurrent or persistent hypothermia. The newborns are usually sick. In most of the cases there is a history of complication during labor and delivery and the babies may be weak and cyanotic at bih.

Of the following, what is the most common cause of this condition?",Endometriosis,Psychological causes,Baholin's gland abscess,Vulvar atrophy,"This patient has vaginismus. Genito-Pelvic Penetration Pain Disorder: GPPPD Dyspareunia : Persistent or recurrent pain with attempted or complete vaginal entry and/or penile vaginal intercourse. This is frequently associated with pelvic pathology such as endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, or ovarian neoplasms. Vaginismus: Persistent or recurrent difficulty to allow vaginal entry of a penis or other object, often with phobic avoidance,anticipation/fear/experience of pain, plus variable and involuntary pelvic muscle contraction. Involuntary reflexive contraction of pelvic muscles and often thighs, abdomen, buttocks, and even jaw, fists, and other muscle groups. The term was only correct when no local or pelvic pathology was present. The diagnosis of vaginismus was provisional until a very careful introital and vaginal examination was done. It may be generalized--the woman is unable to place anything in her vagina, even her own finger or a tampon It may be situational, maybe she can use a tampon and can tolerate a pelvic examination but cannot have intercourse These 2 terms, Dysparunia and Vaginismus, are now combined as mentioned above and called GPPPD. Treatment of vaginismus is graded Psychotherapy. This involves gradual assistance in making the patient aware of her anatomy and encouragement to allow self examination for a few days first and then examination by a gynecologist.

"A 6-month-old comatose infant has multiple broken bones in various stages of healing, a bulging anterior fontanelle, and retinal hemorrhages. For the mentioned description of head injury that follows, select the major abnormality with which it is most likely to be associated.",Intraventricular hemorrhage,Caput succedaneum,Subdural hemorrhage,Subarachnoid hemorrhage,"A subgaleal or subaponeurotic hemorrhage can be life threatening; infants may lose a third or more of their blood volume into this potential space, leading to hypovolemic shock. A subgaleal hemorrhage will feel like a cephalohematoma that crosses the midline. Careful monitoring is essential.Subdural hematomas are commonly seen as part of abusive head trauma, formerly known as shaken baby syndrome. This lesion occurs when the bridging cortical veins that drain the cerebral cortex have been ruptured, leading to a collection of blood between the dura and the cerebral mantle. Repeated trauma can lead to additional collections of blood. In many children, additional findings of abuse such as broken bones, bruises, and retinal hemorrhages are found.Caput succedaneum is soft-tissue swelling of the scalp involving the presenting delivery portion of the head. This lesion is sometimes ecchymotic and can extend across the suture lines. The edema may be pitting, and resolves in the first few days of life.Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), also known as germinal matrix hemorrhage, is commonly seen in very small, preterm infants. The incidence of IVH increases with smaller-size infants and in those with perinatal complications. It occurs in the gelatinous subependymal germinal matrix of the brain and can lead to progressive posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus in these children can present with enlarging head circumference, apnea and bradycardia, lethargy, bulging fontanelle, widely split sutures, or no signs at all. Therapy can include ventricular- peritoneal shunting.Cephalohematomas do not cross the suture line, since they are subperiosteal hemorrhages. No discoloration of the scalp is seen, and the swelling usually progresses over the first few hours of life. Occasionally, skull fractures are present as well. Most cephalohematomas resolve within the first few weeks or months of life without residual findings.",C

A negative Mantoux test goes against active tuberculosis and a negative stool culture also rules out strongyloidiasis. Interpretation of Mantoux test: If the width of the induration is: >= 10 mm: Positive (tuberculin reactors) 6-9 mm: Equivocal/doubtful reaction <=5 mm: Negative reaction Hence, the obvious choice left is option '2', i.e. Crohn's disease.",B

"In a child presenting with obstructive Jaundice, all are seen except –",Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase,Alkaline phosphatase,Glutamate dehydrogenase,5' Nucleotidase,"Neonatal cholestasis 

Neonatal cholestasis is defined as prolonged elevation of serum levels of conjugated bilirubin beyond the first 14 days of life.
Neonatal cholestasis can be divided into extrahepatic and intrahepatic disease and clinical features of any form of cholestasis are more or less similar.
Neonatal hepatitis is the prototype of intrahepatic cholestasis
Biliary atresia is the prototype of extrahepatic biliary atresia

Enzymes that reflect cholestasis: There are three enzymes that are usually elevated in cholestasis

Alkaline phosphatase → Found in or near bile canalicular membrane of hepatocytes
5' nucleotidase
Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase → Located in the endoplasmic reticulum and in bile duct epithelial cells.


Because GGT is more diffusely localized in the liver, its elevation in serum is less specific than are the elevation of Alkaline phosphatase & 5' nucleotidase.
Nevertheless, the following distinction is worthwhile.

'GGT levels are commonly elevated to values more than 10 times normal in biliary atresia while in hepatic causes it is raised to about three times normal.'
Normal values for GGT is about 5-40 IU/L and thus a value of 600 IU/L in the patient in question reflects an elevation of more than ten times the normal value. The patient is thus likely suffering from `biliary atresia'.",C

Distended neck veins (Ref: Dutta 7/e p50, 51, 52, 53, 55: Williams Obstetrics 22/e p1019)Distended neck veins are seen in pregnancy with heart disease, but not seen in normal pregnancy.'Supine hypotension is found during late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces the compression effect on the IVC, when the patient is supine. This, however, results in opening of the collateral circulation by means of paravertebral azygous vein. In some cases (10%), when the collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return of the heart may be seriously curtailed. This results in production of hypotension.' - Dutta 7/e p53A state of hyperventilation occurs during pregnancy leading to increase in tidal volume and therefore respiratory minute volume by 40%. It is probably due to progesterone acting on the respiratory centre and also to increase in sensitivity of the centre to carbon dioxide. The woman feels shortness of breath.'- Dutta 7/e p55'The increased accumulation of fluid in the tissue spaces mainly below the uterus is due to:1. Diminished colloid osmotic tension due to hemodilution driving the fluid out of the vessel2. Increased venous pressure of the inferior extremities.

Neural tube defects are prevented by -,Pyridoxin,Folic acid,Thiamine,Iron,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Folic Acid Neural tube defect o Neural tube defects account for most congenital anamalies of the CNS. o It results from failure of neural tube to close spontaneously between the 3rd and 4th week of in utero development. o Lumbo-sacrol region is the most common site Etiology o NTDs have multiple etiological factors - Maternal diabetes Zinc and folate deficiency Maternal exposure to alcohol, radiation, valproate, carbamazepine Trisomy 13 and 15 o Maternal malnutrition is an impoant risk factor for development of NTD. There is decreased maternal folate levels in NTD affected pregnancies Periconceptional folic acid supplementation decreases the occurrence of NTD. Pathogenesis o The human nervous system develops from neuroectoderm. o During development, behind neuroectoderm lies the mesoderm that encloses the notochord which is derived from endoderm. o Veebral bodies develop from the mesoderm around the notochord. o Neuroectoderm forms invagination Neural groove. This neural groove separates from overlying surface ectoderm and becomes neural tube. o From developing veebral bodies, two dorsal projection extends, which grow around the neural tube and form veebral arch (pedicle and lamina). o Failure of these veebral arches to fuse give rise to Neural tube defect.",B

"A 31-year-old woman comes to the emergency depament because of abdominal pain and vaginal spotting. She states that the pain began 2 days ago and has been worsening since. The spotting occurred this morning. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. She has no medical problems. She takes no medications and has no known drug allergies. Her temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, pulse is 110/minute, and respirations are 14/minute. Abdominal examination reveals significant lower abdominal tenderness. Speculum examination shows scant blood in the vagina with a closed cervical os. Bimanual examination demonstrates significant left adnexal tenderness. Urine hCG is positive. Serum hCG is 5,000 mIU/mL. Pelvic ultrasound shows a normal uterus with a left adnexal mass surrounded by free fluid. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Appendicitis,Ectopic pregnancy,Ovarian cancer,Pelvic inflammatory disease,"This patient has a presentation that is most consistent with ectopic pregnancy. The most common presenting symptoms of patients with ectopic pregnancy are abdominal or pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding. However, many patients have ectopic pregnancies and are asymptomatic until they are discovered incidentally on ultrasound or until they rupture. Examination of a patient with ectopic pregnancy often demonstrates tenderness on the side of the ectopic pregnancy. Occasionally, a mass can be appreciated on that side. The keys to the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy are the serum hCG value and the ultrasound. This patient has a serum hCG level of 5,000 mIU/mL. At this hCG level, a pregnancy would be visualized if it were, in fact, in the uterus. This patient has an ultrasound showing nothing in the uterus with a mass in the left adnexa. This constellation of symptoms and findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Appendicitis can also present with abdominal pain. However, the pain and findings are most often on the right side of the patient's abdomen and this patient has a mass and tenderness on the left side. Fuhermore, vaginal bleeding and elevated hCG levels are not associated with appendicitis. Occasionally, a patient with ovarian cancer will have an hCG-secreting tumor. However, when a woman of childbearing age presents with abdominal pain and vaginal spotting and has a positive hCG value, the diagnosis is almost always pregnancy-related (either ectopic pregnancy, intrauterine pregnancy, or spontaneous aboion) and not ovarian cancer. Pelvic inflammatory disease is rare, but does sometime occur during pregnancy. This patient, however, has findings more consistent with ectopic pregnancy than pelvic inflammatory disease.",B

Under which of the following condition uterus shows both hyperophy and hyperplasia at the same time?,Pregnancy,Multiparity,Nulliparity,Pubey,"During pregnancy, the myometrium goes through a period of extensive growth involving both hyperplasia (increasing the number of smooth muscle cells), cell hyperophy, and increased collagen production by the muscle cells, which strengthens the uterine wall. This well-developed uterine myometrium contracts very forcefully during paurition to expel the infant from the uterus. After pregnancy, uterine smooth muscle cells shrink and many undergo apoptosis, with removal of unneeded collagen, and the uterus returns almost to its prepregnancy size. Ref: Mescher A.L. (2013).

Teenage pregnancy is associated with all except:,Caesarean Section is more common,Eclampsia more common,Post dated pregnancy,| Maternal moality rate,"Ans. is c i.e. Post dated pregnancy Friends- Teenage pregnancy is not only a new topic for PGME exams but has envolved as an emerging problem in our daily OPD'S Hence I am giving in detail about Teenage pregnancy. Defination Teenage pregnancy is defined as pregnancy occurring in a girl below the age of 19. It can be divided into two groups. (i) the 17-19 group and (ii) the below 17 group. All the complications are more in the later group. Incidence Teenage pregnancy accounts for about 10-12% of all bihs. There are two categories of teenage pregnancies, the unwed mothers and the married teenagers. The increasing incidence of the first category is due to changing social norms, permissive attitudes of society, influence of the media and poor access to contraception. The fast breaking down of the joint family system, increase in drug addiction and premarital sex are all responsible for the increase in unwed mothers in our society. However, another large contributing factor for teen pregnancies is child marriage, which still prevails in many Indian states like Rajasthan and Bihar. Complications Maternal In general , maternal moality and morbidity are more among teenage pregnancies especially in the below 15 group and the unwed mothers because there is lack of antenatal care and a tendency to conceal the pregnancy in many cases. Criminal and septic aboions are more in these girls in spite of aboion being liberalized in India. Antepaum complications like anaemia. malnutrition and pre- eclampsia are also much more in teenage pregnancy. Obstetric complications are also increased like, preterm labour, fetal prematurity and IUGR. Cephalopelvic dispropoion may be a problem in the very young teenagers. as they may not have attained complete skeletal maturity. Therefore. the incidence of caesarean section may be more in this group. Other labour complications are also increased if they present for the first time in labour, with out proper antenatal care. 4. Psychological problems. Pregnancy in a teenager is usually unplanned and the girl is undergoing severe mental and emotional trauma. Added to that , she may not be getting adequate family suppo. Depressive disorders and suicidal attempts are common in pregnancy. Even after delivery, maternal- fetal bonding may not be satisfactory. They are more prone to depressive problems and postpaum psychosis after delivery. Long-Term consequences Physical. Induced aboions may increase the risk of recurrent miscarriage, preterm labour and low bih weight babies in the subsequent pregnancy. There is also a higher chance of infeility later on due to infection and blocked tubes. Early age of onset of sexual intercourse and first pregnancy increases the risk of cancer cervix and preinvasive lesions of the cervix. There is also an increased chance of sexually transmitted diseases in unmarried mothers. Psychological - High suicide rates and depressive illness are common. Guilt feelings about a previous aboion or having given the baby for adoption, may occur, sometimes even years later. Social and educational problems. The girl may have to face social outracism which would definitely affect her life. Problems of child These mothers our not emotionally equipped to handle the responsibilities of motherhood. Hence there is poor maternal - child relationship, baby battering & behavioural disturbances in children of such mothers.",C

It has been used as uterine relaxant for threatened abortion and dysmenorrhoea, but efficacy is poor.Side effects: nausea, tachycardia, flushing, dizziness, and tremor. Isoxsuprine has been used in threatened abortion and dysmenorrhoea, but efficacy is doubtful.2Ritodrine (Selective b2 stimulants)infused i.v. have been successfully used to postpone labour but maternal morbidity and mortality may be increased due to their cardiac and metabolic actions and incidents of pulmonary edema.3Atosiban & nifedipineAlthough atosiban and nifedipine seem equally effective in delaying preterm labour, there is increasing concern in twin pregnancies about the adverse CVS effects of nifedipine. Nifedipine should not be used in multiple pregnancies due to fear of pul edema. However, atosiban, which is principally an AVP receptor antagonists is oxytocin receptor antagonist, used for the treatment of preterm labour.4Magnesium sulphateAlso acts as a tocolytic agent. With the withdrawal of sympathomimetic drugs and the failure of atosiban, an oxytocinantagonist, to obtain FDA approval, magnesium sulphate is therefore in commonly used tocolytic drug.Educational points:# Tolterodine is being developed as a vasicoselective antimuscarinic.# Tiotropiumbromide Congener of ipratropium bromide, which binds very tightly to bronchial M1/M3 muscarinic receptors producing long lasting bronchodilatation.

Deficiency of enzyme a-keto acid decarboxylase leading to a block in the metabolism of branch chain amino acids is observed in -,Maple syrup urine disease,Hanup's disease,Alkaptonuria,Phenylketonuria,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Maple Syrup urine diseaseMAPLE SYRUP URINE DISEASE In this disorder, the branched-chain keto acids derived from isoleucine, leucine, and valine appear in the urine, giving it a maple syrup-like odor.This condition results from a deficiency in the branched-chain -keto acid dehydrogenase.It is a mitochondrial, enzyme complex consisting of a-ketoacid decarboxylase , Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase and Transacylase The early steps in the metabolism of these three amino-acids are similar. One of the steps - decarboxylation is accomplished by a complex enzyme system i.e. branched chain oc-keto acid dehydrogenase using thiamine pyrophosphate (vitamin B1) as a coenzyme.The elevated keto acids cause severe brain damage, with death in the first year of life.The disease is characterized by feeding problems,vomiting, dehydration, severe metabolic acidosis, and a characteristic maple syrup odor to the urine.

Most common cause of post paum hemorrhage: September 2009,Trauma,Uterine atony,Tumours,Blood coagulopathy,"Ans. B: Uterine Atony The 4Ts of postpaum hemorrhage (PPH): tone, trauma, tissue, thrombosis, and traction. More than one of these can cause postpaum hemorrhage in any given patient. Uterine atony - 'Tone': Atony is by far the most common cause of postpaum hemorrhage. Uterine contraction is essential for appropriate hemostasis, and disruption of this process can lead to significant bleeding. Uterine atony is the typical cause of postpaum hemorrhage that occurs in the first 4 hours after delivery. Risk factors for atony include the following: Overdistended uterus (e.g., multiple gestation, fetal macrosomia, polyhydramnios) Fatigued uterus (e.g., augmented or prolonged labor, amnionitis, use of uterine tocolytics such as magnesium or calcium channel blockers) Obstructed uterus (e.g., retained placenta or fetal pas, placenta accreta, or an overly distended bladder) Trauma to the genital tract accounts for 20% of cases",B

Since the USG abdomen shows normal ovaries, PCOD and testosterone secreting tumours are ruled out. In idiopathic hirsutism, there is only a mild increase in facial hair and will have normal menstrual cycles. In this condition, levels of free serum testosterone levels are elevated but have normal total serum testosterone levels. So, this patient is most likely suffering from late onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Late onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia: It is a heterogenous group of mild disorder of coisol biosynthesis and is an impoant cause of adult onset hirsuitism. It is mostly caused by deficiency of 21 alpha hydroxylase which leads to increased production of 17 hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione with resultant hyperandrogenicity. These patients are not coisol deficient due to increased ACTH secretion.",C

Dutta obst. 6th ed460)RUPTURE UTERUSDefinition: Dissolution in the continuity of uterine wall anytime beyond 28 weeks of pregnancy.Etiology# Spontaneous rupture during pregnancy: Complete and involves upper segment of uterus. Obstructive rupture during labour: Involves lower segment.# Non-obstructive rupture during labour: Complete and involves fundus.# Incidence of scar rupture is 1-2 % in lower segment scar and 5-10 times more in classical scar.# Obstructive rupture which is an end result of obstructed labour due to neglect in intranatal care involves lower segment and usually extends through one lateral side of uterus to the upper segment. Additionally, oxytocin should not be used in women with prior classic cesarean section scars because the risk of uterine rupture is high (5%-10%).Features of Uterine rupture (during labour)a) Failure in progress of labour.b) Suprapubic pain.c) Slight bleeding PV and Hematuria.d) Alteration in fetal heart rate.e) Unexplained maternal tachycardia.f) Hypotension.g) Tenderness over scar.h) Bladder tenesmus.i) Ballooning of lower segment",A

Which of the following is the best indicator of longterm nutritional status?,Mid arm circumference,Height for age,Weight for age,Weight for height,"Height-for-age (or length-for-age for children <2 yr) is a measure of linear growth, and a deficit represents the cumulative impact of adverse events, usually in the first 1,000 days from conception, that result in stunting, or chronic malnutrition. A low height-for-age typically reflects socioeconomic disadvantage. A low weight-for-height, or wasting, usually indicates acute malnutrition. Conversely, a high weight-for-height indicates overweight. Weight-for-age is the most commonly used index of nutritional status, although a low value has limited clinical significance as it does not differentiate between wasting and stunting. Weight-for-age has the advantage of being somewhat easier to measure than indices that require height measurements.

"A young female presents with a history of dyspnoea on exertion. On examination, she has wide, fixed split S2 with ejection systolic murmur (III/VI) in left second intercostal space. Her ECG shows left axis deviation. The most probable diagnosis is –",Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainge.,Tricuspid atresia.,Ostium primum atrial septal defect.,Ventricular septal defect with pulmonary arterial hypertension.,"Wide fixed splitting of S2 in association with ejection systolic murmur suggests the diagnosis of Atrial septal defect.
Ideally, with hypertrophy of the right side of the heart, right axis deviation should be present, but sometimes left axis deviation is also seen in A.S.D.


The explanation for the presence of left axis deviation in A.S.D


Atrial septal defects are of two types


Ostium primum atrial septal defect
Ostium secundum atrial septal defect


This division depends upon the development of interatrial septum and related structures.
Ostiutn secundum type atrial septal defect is the classical atrial septum defect.
Presence of interatrial septum is the only developmental anomaly in ostium secundum type and associated with right axis deviation.
In contrast, the ostium primum defects are characterized by the presence of certain other developmental abnormalities, besides the interatrial septum.
Once such abnormality is the malformation or lack of development of the anterosuperior division of the left bundle branch.
Maldevelopment of antero superior division of the left bundle branch is responsible for abnormal left axis deviation.",C

In most of the books the criteria for diagosis of postmolar gestational trophoblastic tumor is given - Criteria for diagnosis of post molar gestational trophoblastic tumor as prescribed by FIGO oncology committee in 2002 Relapsed (Recurrent), high risk disease is defined by rising hCG after complete serological response to EMA/CO chemotherapy i.e. having atleast 6 weeks of normal hCG values post chemotherapy. Resistant, or refractory, cases are those that have a rising or plateaued hCG while on EMA/CO So by definition Plateau of hCG is seen in resistent and not relapsed cases hence I am chosing it as the option of choice Also know: Management of Recurrent Gestational Trohoblastic neoplasia Diagnosis Careful radiological assessment should be done in such patients to identify the sites of potentially resectable disease FDG -- PET may be used to locate sites of disease in cases showing serological relapse without visible abnormality on conventional imaging. Treatment Treatment is usually surgical resection followed by postoperative chemotherapy. If no site of relapse is identified. hysterectomy should be done as the most likely site of relapse is uterus .

"In a study it is observed that the right ovary ovulates more than the left, all are possible explanation for the cause except",Anatomical difference between right and left side,Difference in blood supply to both sides,Right handedness is more common in population,Some embryological basis,"Ans. c. Right handedness is more common in population It is believed that right sided predominance was either genetically determined or due to differences in vasculature of the ovaries. The anatomical asymmetry between the left and right side are also thought to be the reason. Ovulation In the primate, it is suggested that ovulations occur with equal frequency in the left and right ovary. In the humans, there is some controversy about the frequency of ovulation on either side It is believed that in normally menstruating women, ovulation was significantly higher in right ovary. It is believed that right sided predominance was either genetically determined or due to differences in vasculature of the ovaries. The anatomical asymmetry between the left and right side are also thought to be the reason. The left ovarian vein drains to the left renal vein and the right ovarian vein to the IVC. The left renal vein is thought to be under pressure than the right and therefore drain slower. Because the left ovary drain slower, the collapsed follicle (corpus leuteum) takes longer to clean and thereby diminishes the chances that ovulation will occur on that side the following month. No such condition exists on the right side, that's why successive right side ovulation is more common",C

It is detected by radioimmunoassay using antibodies to the b chain. HCG is not used as tumour marker because a unit of the FSH, LH and TSH are identical So there can be cross reactivity between a subunits of these hormone. That is why in case of testicular tumours the patients also undergo simultaneous assay of LH to be ceain that the marker detected is b HCG.",D

True about neuroblastoma:,Tumor of autonomic nervous system,Metastasis rarely present,Earliest detected in late childhood,All,"Ans is 'a' i.e., Tumor of autonomic nervous system o Neuroblastoma is a malignant tumor of autonomic nervous system. It is a neuroendocrine tumor, arising from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system. o Neuroblastoma is a disease of early childhood with approximately 90% of patients presenting before 5-years of age and almost 50% within the first 2-years of life. o In childhood, about 40% of neuroblastomas arise in the adrenal medulla0. The remainder occur anywhere along the sympathetic chain, with the most common locations being the paraveebral region of the abdomen (25%) and posterior mediastinum (15%). Tumours may arise in numerous other sites, including the pelvis and neck and within the brain (cerebral neuroblastomas). o It is the second most common solid malignancy of childhood. o In young children, under age 2 years, neuroblastomas generally present with large abdominal masses, fever, and possibly weight loss. In older children, they may not come to attention until metastases produce manifestations, such as bone pain, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. o Neuroblastomas may metastasize widely (Present in 60-70%- Ghai 7th/5990) through the hematogenous and lymphatic systems, paicularly to liver, lungs, and bones, in addition to the bone marrow. o Proptosis and ecchymosis may also be present because the periorbital region is a common metastatic site. Bladder and bowel dysfunction may be caused by paraspinal neuroblastomas that impinge on nerves. o In neonates, disseminated neuroblastomas may present with multiple cutaneous metastases with deep blue discoloration to the skin (earning the rather unfounate designation of 'blueberry muffin baby)' About 90% of neuroblastomas, regardless of location, produce catecholamines (similar to the catecholamines associated with pheochromocytomas), which are an impoant diagnostic feature (i.e., elevated blood levels of catecholamines and elevated urine levels of metabolites, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and homovanillic acid (HVA) Children older than age 5 years usually have extremely poor outcomes irrespective of stage (Robbins 7'/500-503) o NB can present as a parenoplastic syndrome of autoimmune origin manifesting as ataxia or opsomyoclonus ('dancing eye & dancing feet').",A
All are complication of formula fed baby over human milk fed baby except:,Necrotizing enterocolitis,Otitis media,Hypocalcemia,Vit K deficiency,"Formula feeds contain a host of vitamin and minerals, as well as trace elements (zinc, mangnese, copper, iodine) and electrolytes.
In formula feeds vitamin K is added in higher levels than in breast milk to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic diseases in new born. So, vitamin K deficiency can never be a complication of formula fed babies.
Now let’s see what Ghai 6/e, p 164, 331, 177 has to say on the rest of options.
Option “a” i.e. Necrotizing enterocolitis
“Almost all patients of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are artificially fed prior to the onset of illness. Breast milk is protective for NEC.”
—Ghai 6/e, p 164
Option “b” i.e. Otitis media
“Otitis media is one of the most common infections of early childhood. Anatomic features which make this age group particularly susceptible to ear infection include shorter, more horizontally
placed and compliant eustachian tube, which permits reflux of nasopharyngeal secretions into the middle year. A high incidence of bacterial carriage in the adenoids may also contribute to the frequency of otitis media in children. Other risk factors include exposure to cigarette smoke, over crowding, bottle feeding, cleft palate, allergic rhinitis, Down’s syndrome and disorders of mucocilliary transport.”
—Ghai 6/e, p 331
Option “c” i.e. Hypocalcemia
“In the neonatal period there is transient hypoparathyroidism. As a result, less phosphate is excreted in the urine. Human milk is low in phosphate, but cow’s milk is rich in phosphate. Immature parathyroid in the neonates can not easily cope with excess phosphate in cow’s milk leading to hypocalcemia in top fed babies”.

True statement regarding ectopic pregnancy:a) Pregnancy test positiveb) hCG levels should be >1000 mlU/ml for earliest detection of gestational sac by TVSc) hCG levels should be <1000 mlU/ml for earliest detection of gestational sac by TVSd) Methotrexate is used,abd,bcd,abc,ab,"Lets see each option separately-
Option a-
“Urine pregnancy test - ELISA is sensitive to 10-50 MIU/ml and are positive in 95% of ectopic pregnancies.”
Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 182
“Current serum and urine pregnancy test that use enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for -hcG are sensitive of levels of 10 to 20 MIU/ml and are positive in greater than 99% of ectopic pregnancies.”
Williams Obs. 23/e, p 242,
Thus option ‘a’ is correct.
“The lowest level of serum hCG at which a gestation sac is consistently visible using TVS (discriminatory zone) is 1500 IU/L. the corresponding value of serum hCG for TAS is 6000 IU/L. When the hCG value is greater than 1500 IU/L and there is an empty uterine cavity, ectopic pregnancy is more likely”.
Ref Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 183
“A number of investigation have described discriminatory hCG levels above which failure to visualize a uterine pregnancy indicates with high reliability that pregnancy is not alive or ectopic. Banhart and colleagues (1994) reported that an empty uterus with serum hCG concentration 1500 MIU/ml was 100% accurate in excluding a live pregnancy.''

HIV transmission in relation to pregnancy is maximum during:,Labor and delivery,First trimester,Second trimester,Breastfeeding,"Ans. A. Labor and deliverya. The maximum risk is at labor and delivery. A baby can become infected with HIV in the womb, during delivery or while breast-feeding. If the mother does not receive treatment, 25% of babies born to women with HIV will be infected by the virus.b. With treatment that percentage can be reduced to less than 2%. If no preventative steps are taken, the risk of HIV transmission during childbirth is estimated to be 10-20%.c. The chance of transmission is even greater if the baby is exposed to HIV-infected blood or fluids. Health care providers should avoid performing amniotomies (intentionally rupturing the amniotic sac to induce labor), episiotomies and other procedures that expose the baby to the mother's blood.d. The risk of transmission increases by 2% for every hour after membranes have been ruptured.e. Cesarean sections performed before labor and/or the rupture of membranes may significantly reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV.f. About 15% of newborns born to HIV-positive women will become infected if they breastfeed for 24 months or longer.",A

Most impoant manifestation of ureterovaginal fistula is: September 2009,Hydronephrosis,Overflow incontinence,Stress incontinence,Continuous incontenence,"Ans. D: Continuous Incontenence The uncontrolled leakage of urine into the vagina is the hallmark symptom of patients with vesicovaginal fistulas. Patients may complain of urinary incontinence or an increase in vaginal discharge following pelvic surgery or pelvic radiotherapy with or without antecedent surgery. The drainage may be continuous; however, in the presence of a very small vesicovaginal fistula, it may be intermittent. Recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis, abnormal urinary stream, and hematuria also should initiate a workup for vesicovaginal fistula. The time from initial insult to clinical presentation depends on the etiology of the vesicovaginal fistula. A vesicovaginal fistula secondary to a bladder laceration typically presents immediately. Approximately 90% of genitourinary fistulas associated with pelvic surgery are symptomatic within 7-30 days postoperatively. An a:lterior vaginal wall laceration associated with obstetric fistulas typically (75%) presents in the first 24 hours of delivery. In contrast, radiation-induced UGFs are associated with slowly progressive devascularization necrosis and may present 30 days to 30 years later.

single most sensitive marker of intrauterine growth restriction in USG is :,AC,AFI,FL,BPD,"USG is extremely useful not only to diagnose the growth retardation but also to identify a fetus of symmetrical or asymmetrical one. Sonographic predictive values that are commonly used are: * Head circumference (HC) and abdominal circumference (AC) ratios: In a normally growing fetus the HC/AC ratio > 1.0 before 32 weeks,= 1.0 at 32 to 34 weeks. After 34 weeks, it falls below 1.0. If the fetus is affected by asymmetric IUGR, the HC remains larger. The HC/AC is then elevated. In symmetric IUGR, both the HC and AC are reduced. The HC/AC ratio remains normal. Using HC/AC ratio, 85% of IUGR fetuses are detected. Transcerebellar diameter correlates well with the gestational age. AC is the single most sensitive parameter to detect IUGR. * Femur length (FL) is not affected in asymmetric IUGR. The FL/AC ratio is 22 at all gestational ages from 21 weeks to term. FL/AC ratio greater than 23.5 suggests IUGR. * Amniotic fluid volume--The reduced amniotic fluid volume is often associated with asymmetrical IUGR. A veical pocket of amniotic fluid < 1 cm suggests IUGR. An AFI between 5 and 25 cm is normal and an AFI less than 5 indicates oligohydramnios. * Anatomical survey: To exclude fetal anomalies by sonography Reference: Dutta,s Textbook of Obstetrics 7th edition page no 463.",A

The mechanism of action of emergency contraception includes the following except:,By Causing early ovulation,Degeneration of corpus leutum,Inhibition of fertilization,Prevention of implantation of fertilized egg.,"Ans. A. By Causing early ovulation.Methods of emergency contraceptionThere are two methods of emergency contraception:# emergency contraception pills (ECPs)# copper-bearing intrauterine devices (IUDs).When inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse, a copper-bearing IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception available.The emergency contraceptive pill regimen recommended by WHO is one dose of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg, taken within five days (120 hours) of unprotected intercourse.1. Emergency contraception pills# WHO recommends levonorgestrel for emergency contraceptive pill use. Ideally, this progestogen-only method should be taken as a single dose (1.5 mg) within five days (120 hours) of unprotected intercourse. Alternatively, a woman can take the levonorgestrel in two doses (0.75 mg each; 12 hours apart).# Mode of action :Levonorgestrel emergency pills prevent pregnancy by preventing or delaying ovulation. They may also prevent fertilization of an egg by affecting the cervical mucus or the ability of sperm to bind to the egg. They are not effective once the process of implantation has begun.# Effectiveness :levonorgestrel regimen is 52-94% effective in preventing pregnancy. The regimen is more effective the sooner after intercourse it is taken.2. Copper-bearing intrauterine devices (IUDs)# WHO recommends that a copper-bearing IUD, as an emergency contraceptive, be inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse. This may be an ideal emergency contraceptive for a woman who is hoping for an ongoing, highly effective contraceptive method.# Mode of action : As emergency contraception, the copper-bearing IUD primarily prevents fertilization by causing a chemical change that damages sperm and egg before they can meet.# Effectiveness: When inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse, a copper-bearing IUD is over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. This is the most effective form of emergency contraception available. Once inserted, she can continue to use the IUD as an ongoing method of contraception.# Postcoital contraceptivesDrugsDosePregnancy rate (%)Levonorgestrel0.75 mg stat and after 12 hours0-1Ethinyl estradiol 50 mg + Norgestrel 0.25 mg2 tab stat and 2 after 12 hrs0-2Conjugated estrogen15 mg BD x 5 days0-0.6Ethinyl estradiol2.5 mg BD x 5 days0-0.6Mifepristone10 mg single dose0-0.6Copper IUDsInsertion within 5 days0-0.1",A

Which of the following lesions may also be present in this patient?,Cafe-au-lait spots,Coical tubers,Hemangioblastoma,Lisch nodules,"This item tests your knowledge of neurocutaneous syndromes, a group of hereditary conditions characterized by concomitant neoplastic or hamaomatous lesions predominantly affecting the skin and nervous system. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma is a peculiar astrocytic tumor that grows from the walls of the lateral ventricles. It is pathognomonic of tuberous sclerosis, which is caused by mutations of TS1 or TS2 genes. Tuberous sclerosis manifests with multiple hamaomatous lesions in the skin, CNS, and visceral organs. Coical tubers are malformed (hamaomatous) nodules of the coex, probably resulting from faulty coical development. Other lesions include shagreen patches and ash-leaf spots on the skin, cardiac myxomas, and renal angiomyolipomas. Cafe-au-lait spots are found in both types of neurofibromatosis. Lisch nodules are small pigmented nodular lesions of hamaomatous nature that are present in the iris of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Hemangioblastoma is a vascular tumor of unknown histologic origin that frequently develops in the cerebellum of patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Renal cell carcinomas are also common in this disease. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is caused by autosomal dominant mutations of the VHL gene, a tumor suppressor gene. You may recall that mutations of VHL gene are also found in the majority of sporadic renal cell carcinomas. Ref: Bernard T.J., Knupp K., Yang M.L., Kedia S., Levisohn P.M., Moe P.G. (2012).

Which of the following type of pelvis is associated with a lack of single pelvic ala?,Robe's pelvis,Naegele's pelvis,Rachitic pelvis,Osteomalacic pelvis,"Naegele's pelvis: In this type of pelvis one of the ala of the sacrum fails to develop and the pelvis is tilted to one side resulting in an asymmetrical pelvis. Gynaecoid pelvis: Its a typical female pelvis with a well rounded or oval pelvic brim. The outlet is adequate with a pubic angle of 90 degree or more. Ischial spines are not prominent. 75% of women has gynecoid pelvis. Robe's pelvis: In this type both ala of the sacrum are missing resulting in marked reduction in the transverse diameter of the inlet, cavity and outlet. Rachitic pelvis: This pelvis cause brim contraction by the forward rotation of the sacrum. Tri radiate pelvis: It is seen in osteomalacia. This type of pelvis causes beaking of the pelvic inlet, collapse of the lateral walls and funnelling of the lower pelvis.

Which of the following statements is true regarding menorrhagia?,Heavy and regularly timed episodes of bleeding,Heavy and irregularly timed episodes of bleeding,Amount of bleeding greater than 50 ml,Duration of bleeding greater than 3 days,"Menorrhagia is defined as heavy but regular menstrual bleeding. Menorrhagia denotes regularly timed episodes of bleeding that are excessive in amount (>80mL) and/or duration of flow (>7 days) According to the recent update, the term heavy menstrual bleeding has replaced menorrhagia. Hemoglobin concentration below 12 g/dL increase the chance of identifying women with heavy menstrual bleeding. A normal level, however, doesnot exclude heavy menstrual bleeding, as many women with clinically significant bleeding have normal values. All patients should undergo a pelvic examination and, if the menstrual pattern has changed substantially or if anemia is present, a vaginal sonography should be carried out as the most impoant supplemental examination. Vaginal sonography combined with an endometrial biopsy is a reliable method for diagnosing endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, but it is insufficient for diagnosing endometrial polyps and fibroids; these can be diagnosed more reliably by sonohysterography or hysteroscopy. Appropriate treatment considerably improves the quality of life of the patients. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tranexamic acid reduce menstrual blood loss by 20-60% Drug treatment should be used and evaluated before surgical interventions are considered.

Hormones* Mefenamic Acid* Tranexamic acid* Progesterones* Estrogen* OCP's* Danazol/Gestrinone (androgen)* GNRH analoguesNSAID's* Rationale: Its use stems from the suspected role of prostaglandins in the pathogenesis of DUB.* Advantages:- It is required only during menstruation- It provides relief from dysmenorrhea* Tranexamic acid: It is an antifibrinolytic drug which exerts its effects by reversibly blocking lysine binding sites on plasminogen. The resulting decreased plasmin levels diminish fibrinolytic activity within endometrial vessels to prevent bleeding.'Clinically, the drug has been shown effective to reduce bleeding in upto half of the women with DUB related to menorrhagia.' - Ref Williams Gynae 1st/ed, p187According to latest RCOG guidelines tranexamic acid is the first line DOC for menorrhagiaProgesterone's'With the introduction of potent orally active progestins, they became the mainstay in the management of DUB in all age groups and practically replaced the isolated use of oestrogens and androgens.' - Ref Dutta Gynae 5th/ed, p187Estrogen: High dose estrogen therapy may be useful in controlling acute bleeding episodes because it promotes rapid endometrial growth to cover denuded surface. Conjugated equine estrogens are administered orally at dosages up to 10mg daily given in four divided doses. Similarly the drug can be given intravenously in 25mg doses every 4 hours for up to 3 doses. Once bleeding has slowed, patients can be transitioned to an oral taper using COCs.Androgens - Danazol - It is suitable for recurrent symptoms and in patients waiting for hysterectomy. A smaller dose tends to minimize the blood loss and higher dose produces amenorrhea.Gestrinone - can also be used like Danazol.Mifepristone - It is an antiprogesterone. It inhibits ovulation and induces amenorrhea but is not commonly used for DUB (this drug is not mentioned in Williams Gynae for management of DUB)Gonadotropin Releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonist) - Its subtherapeutic doses decrease the blood loss whereas therapeutic doses produce amenorrhea.It is valuable for short term use in severe DUB, particularly if the woman is infertile and wants pregnancy.* As far as ethamsylate is concerned:- It is an hemostatic agent but its action and efficacy is inconsistent.- Though in some books it is given ethamsylate may be used but Williams Gynae. specifically says:'Because of its inconsistent efficacy, in United States ethamsylate doesnot have a clinical role the treatment of menorrhagia.' - Ref Williams Gynae 1st/ed, p187",B

"Misoprostol is indicated in all of the following except: September 2005, 2010",Postpaum hemorrhage,Missed aboion,Induction of labour,Menorrhagia,"Ans. D: Menorrhagia Misoprostol is commonly used for labor induction. It causes uterine contractions and the ripening (effacement or thinning) of the cervix. Misoprostol is more effective in staing labor than other drugs used for labor induction. It is also significantly less expensive than the other commonly used agents. Misoprostol is one of the drugs used for medical aboions in lieu of surgical evacuation. The advantages of medical aboion over surgical aboion include reduced invasiveness of the procedure, lack of risks from general anesthesia (which is often used for surgical aboions), and lack of risk of secondary infeility due to scarring and intrauterine adhesions (Asherman's Syndrome). Misoprostol can also be used to dilate the cervix in preparation for a surgical aboion, paicularly in the second trimester (either alone or in combination with laminaria stents). Misoprostol is sometimes used to treat early fetal death in the absence of spontaneous miscarriage. Misoprostol is also used to prevent and treat post-paum hemorrhage, but it has more side effects and is less effective than oxytocin for this purpose.",D

Coming back to question -

The newborn baby in this question is preterm neonate (born before 37 weeks).
Diaphragmatic hernia may occur in term or preterm infants and may present as respiratory distress soon after birth.
Hyaline membrane disease (HMD) is a disease of preterm neonates and present as respiratory distress during first 6 hours of life.
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) occurs most commonly in neonate of HMD who have been treated with oxygen and positive pressure ventilation ---> Instead of showing improvement on 3rd-4th day, some infants of HMD develop an increased need of oxygen and ventilatory support. So, BPD is not a differential diagnosis of respiratory distress at 2-3 hours after birth.",D

Congenital variety may be associated with urinary tract and may of the same side. The pelvis is obliquely contracted at all levels but more marked in the outlet. Ilio-pectineal line on the affected side is almost straight. Scoliosis involving only the lumbar region will cause deformity of the pelvis. The acetabulum is pushed inwards on the weight bearing side. This may be pronounced if the disease occurs during early life. Oblique asymmetry of the pelvis results in contraction of one of the oblique diameters. Cesarean section is the only safe method of delivery. Robe's pelvis (transversely contracted pelvis): This is an extremely rare abnormality. Ala of both the sides are absent and the sacrum is fused with the innominate bones. Delivery is done by cesarean section. Kyphotic pelvis: It is secondary to the kyphotic changes of the veebral column either following tuberculosis or rickets.The sacrum is tilted backwards in the upper pa and forwards in the lower pa. It is narrow and straight. The anteroposterior diameter of inlet is increased but is diminished at the outlet. Subpubic angle is narrow. Thus, the feature is an extreme funnelling of the pelvis.Abdomen becomes pendulous due to the shoened distance between the symphysis pubis and xiphisternum. Malpresentation is common. Mechanical distress is evident. Cesarean section is ideal and one may have to do the classical operation because of poor formation of the lower segment or for technical reasons. RACHITIC FLAT PELVIS: Rickets is predominantly a disease of early childhood when the bones remain soft and unossified. In childhood changes occur in the bony pelvis due to weight bearing. Inlet: Sacral promontory is pushed downwards and forwards producing a 'reniform' shape of the inlet with marked shoening of the antero-posterior diameter without affecting the transverse diameter, which is often increased. Cavity: Sacrum is flat and tilted backwards. There may be sharp angulation at the sacrococcygeal joint. Outlet: Body weight transmitted through the ischium in sitting position results in widening of the transverse diameter of the outlet and the pubic arch. OSTEOMALACIC PELVIS: The deformity is caused by softening of the pubic bones due to deficiency of calcium and vitamin D and lack of exposure to sunrays. It usually affects women after they have reached maturity. The promontory is pushed downwards and forwards and the lateral pelvic walls are pushed inwards causing the anterior wall to form a beak. The shape of the inlet thus becomes triradiate. Approximation of the two ischial tuberosities occurs. Sacrum is markedly shoened, Coccyx is pushed forward.Cesarean section is ideal.

"A 19-year-old patient presents to your office with primary amenorrhea. She has normal breast and pubic hair development, but the uterus and vagina are absent. Diagnostic possibility includes:",Testicular feminization syndrome,Gonadal dysgenesis,Mullerian agenesis,Klinefelter syndrome,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Mullerian agenesis * Since this patient has other signs of pubertal development that are sex steroid- dependent, we can conclude that some ovarian function is present. This excludes conditions such as gonadal dysgenesis and hypothalamic pituitary failure as possible causes of her primary amenorrhea. Mullerian defects are the only plausible cause, and the diagnostic evaluation in this patient would be directed toward both confirmation of this diagnosis and establishment of the exact nature of the Mullerian defect. Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky- Kuster-Hauser syndrome, presents as amenorrhea with absence of a vagina. The incidence is approximately 1 in 10,000 female births. The karyotype is 46 XX. There is normal development of breasts, sexual hair, ovaries, and external genitalia. There are associated urinary tract (33%) and skeletal (12%) anomalies.* Testicular feminization, or congenital androgen insensitivity syndrome, is an X-linked recessive disorder with a karyotype of 46 X Y. The patient presents with an absent uterus and blind vaginal canal. However, in these patients the amount of sexual hair is significantly decreased/absent.* Patients with gonadal dysgenesis present with lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome typically have a karyotype of 47 XXY and a male phenotype.Note: In patients of Mullerian agenesis (RMKH syndrome) ovary is present and it functions normally",C

Which mutation is seen in Down’s syndrome -,Monosomy X,Trisomy 21,Trisomy 22,Trisomy 22,"The basic molecular defect in Down's syndrome is the extra genetic material of chromosome 21. It may be due to :

1) Trisomy 21

This is the most common cause (95%). There is an extra chromosome 21 (i.e. three 21 chromosomes) which is due to meiotic nondisjunction in the ovum. The extra chromosome is of maternal origin. The most important risk factor is advanced maternal age (> 35 years).

2) Roberston translocation

This accounts for 3% of cases. Extra material of 21 chromosomes comes from Robertson translocation of the long arm of chromosome 21 to another acrocentric chromosome (22, or 14 or 15), i.e. t (22: 21), t (14:21), or t (15:21). It has no relation with maternal age.

3) Mosaicism (Mosaic 21)

In 2% of patients, there is mosaicism, i.e. occurrence of two or more different types of the cell population (46 XX / 47 XX + 21) in the same individual, due to mitotic nondisjunction of chromosome 21. There is no correlation with maternal age.

4) Partial trisomy

Alternately, VUR may be suspected when a prenatal ultrasound reveals that the fetus has dilated kidneys, Voiding cystourethogram (VCUG). During this exam, a doctor use a thin, plastic tube to inject a fluid with an X-ray dye into your bladder. Then an X-ray machine takes a video during while you pee to see whether the fluid goes backward from the bladder to reach one or both kidneys. Children may become upset during this test, so it can be done with medicines that help keep them calm. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

Which of the following parameter can be measured any time during the menstrual cycle to test ovarian reserve?,Serum FSH,Serum estradiol,Serum Anti Mullerian hormone,Antral follicular count,"Ovarian ReserveOvarian reserve refers to the size of the nongrowing, or resting, primordial follicle population in the ovaries. This, in turn, presumably determines the number of growing follicles and the 'quality' or reproductive potential of their oocytes.Serum Day 3 Follicle Stimulating HormoneAs women age, FSH physiologically rises in the early follicular phase (cycle day 3), with levels of 5.74 IU/L at age 35 to 39 and 14.34 IU/L at age 45 to 59.In women in their 40s, levels greater than 20 IU/L are predictive of menopause. Basal Estradiol LevelBasal day 3 FSH is often combined with estradiol (E2) testing. Estradiol levels on day 3 of the menstrual cycle reflect follicular growth rather than the number of antral follicles.Clomiphene Citrate Challenge TestClomiphene citrate is thought to have antiestrogenic effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, resulting in a decrease in E2-mediated suppression of FSH production by the pituitary. The clomiphene citrate challenge test (CCCT) involves the measurement of serum FSH and estradiol on day 3 of the menstrual cycle, and again on day 10 after administration of clomiphene citrate (100 mg orally each day) from days 5 to 9.Serum Inhibin BSerum inhibin B is secreted by ovarian granulosa cells staing at the preantral follicle stage and therefore reflects the size of the growing follicular cohoInhibin B alone has poor predictive value for ovarian response but improves the predictive value when added to the CCCT.Unlike basal testing, levels of inhibin B measured on the 5th day of ovarian Serum Antimullerian Hormone Antimullerian hormone (AMH) is produced by the granulosa cells of preantral and small antral follicles.The serum level of AMH in women with normal cycles declines with age and becomes undetectable after menopause.AMH appears to be a good predictor of both stimulation and were predictive of live bih following IVF/ICSI.excessive (>3.5 ng/mL) and poor (<1 ng/mL) IVF stimulation response and is strongly correlated to the antral follicle count (111,116,117). Unlike other serum markers, AMH can be measured at any time in the menstrual cycleAntral Follicular countUsing transvaginal ultrasound in the early follicular phase, all ovarian follicles 2 to 10 mm are counted and the total for both ovaries is called the basal antral follicle count (AFC). The AFC correlates well with chronologic age in normal feile women and appears to reflect what remains of the primordial follicular pool (104). Decreases in AFC with age are gradual rather than sudden (118). A total AFC less than 4 is predictive of poor response and higher cancellation rates with IVF.Reference: Novak's Gynecology; 14th edition; Chapter 32; Infeility and Assisted Reproductive Technology",C

Such risk factors include a history of uterine or cervical surgery, infections related to use of an intrauterine device, and severe pelvic inflammatory disease. Asherman syndrome is found in 39% of patients undergoing hysterosalpingography who previously underwent postpaum curettage.

Twin pregnancy
Molar pregnancy
Concealed variety of Abruptio placenta
Polyhydramnios.


Twin pregnancy can be ruled out because it doenot explain persistent vaginal bleeding and moreover in twin/multiple pregnancy fetal heart tones are not absent…2 or more FHS are heard depending on the number of fetuses.
Concealed variety of APH doesnot occur in late first trimester. APH by definition means any bleeding which occurs after 28 weeks of pregnancy and uptil the birth of the child and hence it can be ruled out although absent fetal tones and Fundal height more than the gestational age are seen.
Polyhydramnios again can be ruled out since bleeding cannot be explained by it …so we are left with molar pregnancy which explainds all the findings.",A
Most useful maternal serum test used for distinguishing open neural tube defects and ventral wall defect in a fetus?,Carcinoembryogenic antigen,Sphingomyelin,Alpha-feto protein,Acetylcholinesterase,"Acetylcholinesterase is derived mostly from the tissues of the fetal nervous system. Amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase is a biochemical marker that is positive in 95% fetuses with open neural tube defects.

A new born infant is diagnosed with phenylketonuria. The enzyme that is deficient is,Phenylamine oxidase,Tyrosine hydroxylase,Phenylalanine hydroxylase,Dihydropteridine reductase,"Phenylketonuria is a disorder of phenylalanine metabolism and occurs due to deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase.It is a recessive condition.Here,phenylalanine could not be conveed to tyrosine,so phenylalanine accumulates and alternate minor pathways are opened to produce and excrete phenylketone(phenyl pyruvate),phenyl lactate and phenyl acetate in urine. Phenylalanine hydroxylase is an enzyme your body uses to conve phenylalanine into tyrosine, which your body needs to create neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. PKU is caused by a defect in the gene that helps create phenylalanine hydroxylase. When this enzyme is missing, your body can't break down phenylalanine. This causes a buildup of phenylalanine in your body. Reference:Essential pediatrics-Ghai,8th edition,page no:652;Textbook of biochemistry-DM Vasudevan,6th edition,page no:207",C
Which organ is the primary site of hematopoiesis in the fetus before mid-pregnancy –,Bone,Liver,Spleen,Lung,"In fetus, hematopoiesis occurs in three anatomic stages.
Mesoblastic stage 

This stage of hematopoiesis begins between 10th and 14th days of gestation
It occurs in the extraembryonic structures principally in the yolk sac.
This stage of hematopoiesis essentially ceases by 10-12 week of gestation.

Hepatitis stage

By 6-8 weeks of gestation, the liver replaces the yolk sac as the primary site of gestation.
Hematopoiesis occurs in the liver throughout the remainder of the gestation and the liver remains the predominant hematopoietic organ, till 20-24 weeks of the gestation.
After this, the hematopoiesis begins to decrease in liver and in full-term infant hepatic hematopoiesis is seen only in widely scattered small foci which soon become inactive after birth.

Myeloid stage

Hematopoiesis in the marrow starts by the 4th month of gestation.
By birth, marrow throughout the skeleton is hematopoietically active and virtually the sole source of blood cells.

Hematopoiesis after birth
Upto puberty - Hematopoiesis occurs throughout the skeleton
After puberty (By the age of 18) - Only the vertebrae, ribs, sternum, skull, pelvis and proximal epiphyseal regions of the humerus and femur retain red marrow, the remaining marrow becomes yellow, fatty an inactive. Thus, in adults only about half of the marrow space is active-in hematopoiesis.",B

Common to both acute and chronic malnutrition is –,Weight for age,Weight for height,Height for age,BMI,"Weight for height is decreased in both acute as well as chronic malnutrition. However, it cannot distinguish between acute and chronic malnutrition.
Therefore, weight for age is a common indicator to reflect both acute and chronic malnutrition. However, it is not the best indicator for this (as weight for age cannot differentiate acute from chronic malnutrition).
Best indicator for this purpose( to differentiate acute from chronic malnutrition) is the simultaneous measurement of 'weight for height (wasting)' and 'height for age' (stunting)'which is useful to understand the dynamics of malnutrition, distinguishing between current ( acute) malnutrition and long term (chronic)malnutrition.
So, for both acute and chronic malnutrition: -

i) Single common indicator → weight for age
ii) Best indicator is simultaneous measurement for stunting (deficit in height for age) and wasting (deficit in weight for height)",A

Fern test is due to :,Presence of NaCI under progesterone effect,Presence of NaCI under estrogenic effect,LH/FSH,Mucus secretion by Glands,"Ans. is b i.e. Presence of NaCI under estrogenic effect Fern test is for documenting ovulation. Procedure : A specimen of cervical mucus is obtained and is spread on a clean Glass slide and allowed to dry. It is then viewed under the low power microscope. Result and interpretation : Under the influence of estrogen on Day12-Day 14 cervical mucus shows characteristic pattern of fern formation. The ferning is due to the presence of sodium chloride in the mucus secreted under estrogen effect. After ovulation on Day 21-23, ferning disappears because protein content increases and Sodium chloride decreases under the effect of progesterone. Disappearance of ferning after ovulation and if previously present its disappearance is presumptive evidence of corpus luteum activity.

Most common cause of per rectal bleeding in infant is -,Anal fissure,Rectal polyp,Intussusception,Hypertension,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Anal fissure Anal fissure :-o Anal fissure is a laceration of the anal mucocutaneous junction. It is an acquired lesion of unknown etiology thought to be secondary to the forceful passage of a hard stool, mainly seen in infants < 1 yr of age. Fissures may be the consequence and not the cause of constipation.o A histoiy of constipation is often noted. A patient may have a painful bowel movement, which may correspond to the fissure formation after passing of hard stool. The patient then voluntarily retains stool to avoid another painful bowel movement. This exacerbates the constipation, and, eventually, the passing of harder stools. Pain on defecation and bright red blood on the surface of the stool may be observed. The diagnosis is established by inspection of the perineal area. The infant's hips are held in acute flexion, the buttocks are separated to expand the folds of the perianal skin, and the fissure becomes evident as a minor laceration. Sometimes, peripheral to the laceration, the patient has a little skin appendage that actually represents epithelialized granulomatous tissue, secondary to the chronic inflammation; this is usually known as a ''tag.'

Increase seen in plasma volume in pregnancy: March 2010,10-20%,20-30%,30-40%,40-50%,"Ans. D: 40-50% The most striking maternal physiologic alteration occuring during pregnancy is the increase in the blood volume. The magnitude of the increases varies according to the size of woman, the number of pregnancies she has had, the number of infants she has delivered, and whether there is one or multiple fetuses. The increases in blood volume progress until term; the average increase in volume at term is 45-50%. The increase is needed for extra blood flow to the uterus, extra metabolic needs of fetus and increased perfusion of others organs, especially kidneys. Extra volume also compensate for maternal blood loss delivery. Plasma volume increases during pregnancy. The rate of increase almost parallels to that of blood volume but the maximum is reached to the extent of 50%.Total plasma volume increases to the extent of 1.25 litres.",D

The greatest protection is offered, if it is taken within 12 hours, as postponing the dose by 12 hours raises the chances of pregnancy by almost 50%.For this reason, the treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after sexual exposure.Note: But here the question says - till how long are ECs effective or till how long can they be administered. - Ref: Shaw 14th/ed, p213 says'The tables can be offered up to 120 hours, but its efficacy decreases with the longer coital - drug interval.''Treatment should be initiated as soon after exposure as possible, and the standard recommendation is that it be no later than 120 h.' - Ref: Leon Speroff 8th/ed, p1042 According to current concepts in contraception's and women health alsoEmergency contraception can be given up to 5 days.This is because'Emergency contraception is not an abortifacient i.e. it will not act after implantation has occured.

A new bom child developed respiratory depression in neonatal ward. Which of the following drug is the cause -,Opioids,Barbiturates,Diazepam,Propofol,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Opioids Epidural opioid (fentanyl) analgesia is commonly employed as a therapeutic modality in the management of pain during labour.The general perception is that administered drugs remain in the maternal epidural space and do not compromise the respiratory status of the newborn.Contrary to the widely held belief fentanyl diffuses freely from the epidural space into the maternal blood because of its high lipid solubility.Equilibrium is reached within 10-30 min. The drug is freely transported across the placenta with a slightly higher concentration in the fetal compartment because of a comparative acidic pH.There is no consensus on the dose of fentanyl causing respiratory depression in the newborn period.However, it appears that neonates are prone to respiratory depression at a lower concentration because of the immaturity of the respiratory centre.According to the Cochrane analysisMorphine, meperidine and fentanyl are the opioids that have been studied the most in labour analgesia research.These opioids as well as newer alternatives, such as nalbuphine have been associated with newborn respiratory depression at birth. Opioids are known for their high lipid solubility which allows rapid transfer of the drug through the placenta and into the fetus. The risk of respiratory depression is highest if birth occurs at the time of peak fetal uptake between 1-4 hours after administration of drug to the mother. Repeated doses of opioids results in significant fetal exposure and neonatal respiratory depression.Opioids are also used in neonates for pain managementThey are the mainstay of pain management in newborn.In newborns the clearance is diminished and elimination half-lives are prolonged as compared to adults because of the immaturity of hepatic cytochrome system of the neonates.Therefore opioid administration may result in opioid accumulation and respiratory depression.",A

Beginning in childhood, affected individuals develop an insatiable appetite, which leads to chronic overeating (hyperphagia) and obesity.o Some people with Prader-Willi syndrome, particularly those with obesity, also develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (the most common form of diabetes).o People with Prader-Willi syndrome typically have mild to moderate intellectual impairment and learning disabilities,o Behavioral problems are common, including temper outbursts, stubbornness, and compulsive behavior such as picking at the skin. Sleep abnormalities can also occur.o Additional features of this condition include distinctive facia! features such as a narrow forehead, almond-shaped eyes, and a triangular mouth; short stature; and small hands and feet. Some people with Prader-Willi syndrome have unusually fair skin and light-colored hair.o Both affected males and affected females have underdeveloped genitals.

Controls bleedingII. Contraceptive benefit.In future, if she desires pregnancy, she may get mirena removed.Our answer is further supported by the following lines -'The LNG IUS can be used in all women as a first line of treatment of menorrhagia inplace of oral medications. It is particularly useful in reproductive aged women who desire contraception.' - Ref: Williams Gynae 1st/ed, p188'Heavy menstrual bleeding that doesnot respond to oral medication may be managed by endometrial ablation using coagulation, resection or vaporization provided that patient is willing to forgo future fertility.

The metabolic defect in HEREDITARY FRUCTOSE INTOLERANCE is due to deficiency of enzyme:,Fructokinase,Aldolase-B,Xylitol dehydrogenase,Phosphofructokinase,"Ans. (b) Aldolase-BRef : OP Ghai 8th ed./696* Hereditary fructose intolerance, or the presence of fructose in the blood (fructosemia), is caused by a deficiency of aldolase B, the second enzyme involved in the metabolism of fructose. This enzyme deficiency results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, which inhibits the production of glucose and results in diminished regeneration of adenosine triphosphate. Clinically, patients with hereditary fructose intolerance are much more severely affected than those with essential fructosuria, with elevated uric acid, growth abnormalities and can result in coma if untreated.Remember and Don't Confuse with:* Essential fructosuria caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hepatic fructokinase is a clinically benign condition characterized by the incomplete metabolism of fructose in the liver, leading to its excretion in urine.",B
A 23-year-old woman presents for evaluation of a 7-month history of amenorrhea. Examination discloses bilateral galactorrhea and normal breast and pelvic examinations. Pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following classes of medication is a possible cause of her condition?,Antiestrogens,Gonadotropins,Phenothiazines,Prostaglandins,"Amenorrhea and galactorrhea may be seen when something causes an increase in prolactin secretion or action. The differential diagnosis involves several possible causes. Excessive estrogens, such as with birth control pills, can reduce prolactin- inhibiting factor, thus raising serum prolactin level. Similarly, intensive suckling (during lactation and associated with sexual foreplay) can activate the reflex arc that results in hyperprolactinemia. Many antipsychotic medications, especially the phenothiazines, are also known to have mammotropic properties. Hypothyroidism appears to cause galactorrhea secondary to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation of prolactin release. When prolactin levels are persistently elevated without obvious cause (e.g., in breast-feeding), evaluation for pituitary adenoma becomes necessary.",C

Kernicterus has developed when bilirubin levels exceed 30 mg/dL, although the range is wide (21-50 mg/dL).Its onset is usually in the 1st wk of life, but it may.be delayed to the 2nd-3rd wk.Kernicterus develops at lower bilirubin levels in preterm infants and in the presence of asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage, hemolysis, or drugs that displace bilirubin from albumin. The exact serum bilirubin level that is harmful for VLBW infants is unclear. Kernicterus does occur in patients with breast milk jaundice but is very uncommon.The surface of the brain is usually pale yellow.

Clotting studies are likely to show which of the following?",Increased levels of factors V and VIII,A decreased prothrombin level,An increased fibrinogen level,The presence of fibrin split products,"The clinical history and blood smear findings (fragmented cells and few platelets) presented in the question are typical of DIC. The disorder, which can be triggered by endotoxin shock, results ultimately in the initiation of the intrinsic clotting mechanism and the generation of thrombin (prolonged PT and PTT, decreased fibrinogen concentration, and an increase in fibrin split products). Fibrin deposited in the microcirculatory system can lead to tissue ischemia and necrosis, further capillary damage, release of thromboplastic substances, and increased thrombin generation. Simultaneous activation of the fibrinolytic system produces increased amounts of fibrin split products, which inhibit thrombin activity. Of utmost importance in the treatment of children who have DIC is the management of the condition that precipitated the disorder.",D

Dutta 8th ed. / 212, Williams obst. 21st ed.l 892Diagnosis of Ectopic Pregnancy* Most definite diagnosis of pregnancy is by demonstrating intrauterine sac.* An absence of the intrauterine sac in a patient who is complaining of pain, bleeding and positive pregnancy test raise the suspicion of ectopic pregnancy.* By doing transvaginal UTZ, ectopic pregnancy can be ruled out. If the UTZ demonstrates live intrauterine fetus then ectopic pregnancy is very unlikely.* On the other hand, if the uterus is empty, an ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed based on the visualization of an adnexal mass separate from the ovaries.* Beta-HCG also helps in diagnosis of pregnancy. It is positive in virtually 100% of ectopic pregnancies.* A positive test only confirms pregnancy and does not indicate whether it is intrauterine or extrauterine (ectopic).* In normal pregnancy beta-HCG should double up every 2 days but in ectopic pregnancy the rate of increase of beta HCG is slow.CULDOCENTESIS* Culdocentesis is the transvaginal passage of a needle into the posterior cul-de-sac in order to determine whether free blood is present in the abdomen.* This procedure will reveal non-clotted blood if intra- abdominal bleeding has occurred.* Clotted bloods signify ruptured ectopic pregnancy.* If culdocentesis is positive, laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed immediately.",A

Newer progestational contraceptives primarily act by:,Oviductal motility,Uterine endometrium,Cervix,Inhibiting ovulation,"FOGSI is Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India and the highest governing body in Obs and Gynae in India.
Progesterone only pills act mainly by causing thickening of cervical mucus.
Progesterone only pills
Mechanism of action of POP's is mainly on cervical mucus -

'All Estrogen free pills except the newer desogesterel pill primarily rely on changes in cervical mucus as they do not inhibit ovulation consistently.'
The cervical mucus effect peaks within 3-4.hours after taking the tablet and lasts for about 22 hours. Hence the next tablet must be taken within 27 hours of the preceeding tablet or else the contraceptive benefit of the cervical mucus effect will decrease and finally subside.
Unlike COC's that almost always prevent ovulation, traditional POP's (progesterone only pills) inhibit ovulation in 40-50% of cycles. 'A randomized double blind study, performed over 13 cycles showed that 75 lig desogestrel daily was sufficient to inhibit ovulation in 97% of cycles. Hence for newer POP's containing desogestrel the primary mode of action is inhibition of ovulation'. - FOGSI Focus Jan 06 issue on Modern pill, Chapter Estrogen free pill p 41
Thus, for newer progestational agents main mechanism of action is by inhibition of ovulation.

Remember

Traditional POP's are also known as Low-dose progestogen only pills.                                                    
Main progesterone used are:  
 Norethisterone 350 mcg
Norgestrel 75 mcg
Levonorgesterel 30 mcg
Their main mechanism of action (as discussed earlier) is thickening of cervical mucus.Q

A child with acute myeloid leukemia presents with hyperleukocytosis. Treatment includes all of the following except –,IV fluid,Allopurinol,Ailcalinization,Immediately start induction chemotherapy,"Hyperleukocytosis and Leukostasis 

Hyperleukocytosis refers to condition in which patients with acute leukemia present with an extraordinary high leukocyte count usually greater than 100,000/ 1.
Leukostasis (Also known as symptomatic hyperleukocytosis) is a medical emergency most commonly seen in patients with AML or CML in blast crisis. There is sludging of leukemia blasts in the microcirculation (due to extremely elevated blast cells) leading to obstruction of small vessels especially in the cerebral and pulmonary circulation.



Treatment of hyperleukocytosis includes : -

1. Immediate leukoreduction (cytoreduction)

Immediate leukoreduction is required to lower the blast cells.
This can be achieved by leukopharesis or by administration of hydroxyurea.

2. Induction chemotherapy

Induction chemotherapy is initiated early, but only after attempts at leukoreduction (not immediately) as immediate administration of induction chemotherapy carries a high risk of acute tumor lysis syndrome.
So, early induction chemotherapy is advised but not immediately.

3. Supportive/Prevention of complications

Supportive therapy is given to prevent/reduce the metabolic complications of tumor lysis syndrome.
It includes IV hydration, allopurinol and alkalinization of urine.",D

True about breast feeding –,Best for both preterm & term,Promote lactobacillus growth in bowel,Decrease allergic disorder,All of these,"Breast milk is beneficial for both preterm and term infants because the composition of breast milk varies according to the needs and age of the infants. For example, preterm milk contains more protein `S', sodium, iron, immunoglobulins and calories as they are needed by the preterm baby.
Breast milk and energy by different constituents

Carbohydrate                                      30-40%
Protein                                                  7-10%
Fat                                                          45-60%

Breast milk contains N-acetyl-D glucose and lactose which promotes lactobacillus. On the other hand, high content of glucose and casein in formula feeds inhibits the growth of lactobacillus.
Breast milk appears to be protective for necrotizing enterocolitis. Almost all patients of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis are artificially fed.
Low protein contents of breast milk along with a higher concentration of secretory IgA decreases the absorption of protein macromolecules ---> Less chances of allergy and asthma",D

Karyotype of Sweyer syndrome,46XY,46XX,45XO,47XXY,"Sweyer syndrome is an uncommon form of gonadal dysgenesis, characterized by a 46, XY karyotype. Despite the presence of a Y chromosome, the phenotype is female because the dysgenetic (streak) gonads produce neither AMH nor androgens. Consequently, the vagina, cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes develop normally and the internal and external genitalia do not masculinize. In approximately 10-15% of patients, the disorder results from an inactivating mutation in the SRY gene, but in most, no cause can be identified. Patients with Swyer syndrome generally present after the expected time of pubey with delayed sexual maturation, primary amenorrhea, normal pubic hair, and normal female internal and external genital anatomy. Evaluation reveals hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, prompting a karyotype that establishes the diagnosis.

What is the most common cause of preload disorders in children?,Distributive shock,Hypovolemic shock from vomiting and diarrhea,Congestive hea failure,Severe anemia,"Preload is the amount of blood that the hea receives to distribute to the body. In addition to hea rate, afterload, and cardiac contractility, preload determines cardiac output. In children, the most common cause of decreased preload is hypovolemia, usually from vomiting and diarrhea. Distributive shock secondary to sepsis, neurogenic spinal shock, or anaphylaxis is a less common cause of preload reduction. Acute anemia may also be associated with decreased preload. Congestive hea failure is a frequent complication in children with congenital hea disease. Increased preload results in elevation of left atrial pressure leading to pulmonary edema and decreased oxygenation. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",B

All are mechanisms of IUCDs except:,Chronic endometrial inflammation,Increase the motility of tubes,Inducing endometrial atrophy,Inhibition of ovulation in >80% of the users,"Mechanism of Action: Several mechanisms are responsible for the contraceptive effect of an IUCD. The presence of a foreign body in the uterine cavity renders the migration of spermatozoa difficult. A foreign body within the uterus provokes uterine contractility through prostaglandin release and increases the tubal peristalsis so that the feilized egg is propelled down the fallopian tube and more rapidly than in normal and it reached the uterine cavity before the development of chorionic villi and thus is unable to implant. The device in situ causes leucocytic infiltration in the endometrium. The macrophage engulf the feilized egg if it enters the endometrial tissue which inimical to the implantation of the feilized ovum Progesterone-carrying device causes alteration in the cervical mucus which prevents penetration of sperm, in addition to its local action. It also causes endometrial atrophy. It prevents ovulation in about 40% Ref: Shaw&;s textbook of Gynaecology 17th edition Pgno: 261",D

What is the MOST probable diagnosis in this child?,Autism,ADHD,Mental retardation,Specific learning disability,"This child is most probably suffering from autism. Autism is a neurologic disorder characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction and communication and presence of restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Pervasive developmental disorder: Children with this disorder have impaired social interaction and shows repetitive behaviors. They do not have significant delays in cognitive, language or self-help skills. Childhood disintegrative disorder: Children have normal development for 2 years following which there will be regression in at least one of the following areas: social interaction, communication, and behavior.

X-ray Wrist joint is given. Comment on the diagnosis?,Hypophosphatemic rickets,Barter syndrome,Chronic renal failure,Polycystic kidneys,"Ans. (a) Hypophosphatemic rickets.* The X-ray wrist shows cupping and splaying of distal end of radius. However serum calcium is normal with normal SAP ruling out nutritional rickets.* However the radiological findings can be explained by low phosphate levels secondary to phosphate wasting. In hypophosphatemic rickets due to PHEX-1 gene phosphate depletion leads to depletion of hydroxyapatite in the bone which weakens the bone leading to rickets and bowing of legs.

Which of the following is generally not seen in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) –,More common in females,"Petechiae, ecchymosis and bleeding",Palpable splenomegaly,Increased megakaryocytes in bone marrow,"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura

There are two clinical subtypes of primary I.T.P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from the formation of antiplatelet antibodies.

Pathology

The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic.
The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in spleen the spleen size remains normal.  

Bone Marrow

Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes.
These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction.
The importance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure.
A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I.T.P.

Clinical Features

Chronic ITP occurs most commonly in adult women, younger than age 40 years.
Female to male ratio is 4: 1.
The clinical signs and symptoms associated with I.T.P are non-specific for this condition but they are rather reflective of thrombocytopenia.
The disease is often insidious in onset and is characterized by bleeding into the skin and mucosal surfaces.
Cutaneous bleeding occurs in the form of pinpoint haemorrhages, petechiae or ecchymoses. Often there will be a history of easy bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums and haemorrhages into soft tissues from relatively minor trauma.
Sometimes disease may first manifest with melena, hematuria or excessive menstrual flow.
Subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haemorrhage are serious consequences of thrombocytopenic purpura but fortunately are rare in treated patients.",C

Immediately after delivery (Ref: Dutta's 6/e p53)The highest volume overload in a parturient due to maximum cardiac output is seen immediately after delivery.'Peripheral vasodilation leading to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance is thought to be the first cardiovascular change associated with pregnancy (induced by progesterone). Cardiac output increases in response to this, by 20% at 8 weeks gestation and by up to 40-50% at 20-28 weeks gestation. Labour leads to further increases in cardiac output by 15% in the first stage and 50% in the second stage due to the combination of auto-transfusion of 300-500 ml of blood back into the circulation with each uterine contraction, and sympathetic stimulation caused by pain and anxiety. Cardiac output increases again immediately after delivery due to auto-transfusion of blood via uterine contraction and relief of aortocaval compression.

Most common genital prolapse is :,Cystocoele,Procidentia,Rectocoele,Enterocoele,"Ans. is a i.e. Cystocoele Genital prolapse : refers to protusion of the pelvic organ into or out of the vaginal wall. Classification of prolapse Anterior vaginal wall : upper two thirds - cystocoele Cytourethrocoele lower one third - urethrocoele Posterior vaginal wall : upper one third - enterocoele (pouch of Douglas Hernia) Grade I = Descent halfway to the hymen Grade II = Descent to the hymen Grade IIt = Descent halfway past the hymen Grade IV = Maximum possible descent for site Bader walker Halfway system : 11, Grade 0 = Normal postion for each reproesentative site Uterine descent : Shaw's classification (old classification) : 1deg- descent of the cervix to the vagina 2deg - descent of the cervix to the introitus 3deg - descent of the cervix outside the introitus. Procidentia : all of the uterus outside the introitus. Utero vaginal Prolapse : It is the commonest type of prolapse. Cystocoele occurs first followed by traction on the cervix causing retroversion of the uterus and then uterus is pushed into the vagina. Vault prolapse : it follows vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy, symptoms are-coital difficulty and difficulty in walking. Congenital Prolapse : There is no cystocoele. 'Data from Women's Health Initiative revealed anterior pelvic organ prolapse in 34.3%, posterior wall prolapse in 18.6% and uterine prolapse in 14.3% of women in the study.' Therefore, from the above data it is clear that cystocele (anterior organ prolapse) is the most common type of prolapse.

She is symptomatic with multiple gall stones For her management, she is planned for hysterectomy. Which of the following is true for the surgery?",A supracervical hysterectomy should be considered to preserve sexual function and pelvic suppo,Cholecystectomy should not be combined with hysterectomy as it increases post operative febrile morbidity and length of hospital stay,Thromboprophylaxis is required post operatively,"Since the age group is a likelihood for an endometrial malignancy, a radical Hysterectomy hence is a better option","All patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign disorders are at (at least) moderate risk for venous thromboembolism and require prophylaxis. Mechano-prophylaxis (intermittent pneumatic compression devices) or chemoprophylaxis (unfractionated heparin or low molecular-weight heparin) or a combination of chemoprophylaxis and mechano-prophylaxis are indicated, depending on the patient's risk. Pelvic surgeries are the maximum risk of DVT development and hence Thromboprophylaxis is required here. There is no evidence to suppo the concept that leaving the cervix improves sexual function or lower rates of incontinence or constipation. Gallbladder disease is about four times more common in women than men, and its highest incidence occurs between 50 and 70 years of age, when hysterectomy is most often performed.

It is characterized by adrenal insufficiency. The pathological examination of the adrenal gland reveals that:- This causes low coisol concentration because the zona fasciculata is primarily responsible for glucocoicoid production. Because the zona glomerulosa is well preserved mineralocoicoid action is usually unaffected. Low circulating serum coisol results in lack of feedback inhibition to the hypothalamus which results in increased ACTH secretion from pituitary. Clinical features Patients with .familial glucocoicoid deficiency generally presents with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency with the impoant distinction that mineralocoicoid production is always normal. The most common initial presenting sign is 'deep hyperm,ementation' of the skin, mucous membrane or both as a result of the action of adrenocoicotrophic hormone (ACTH) on cutaneous melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) receptors.

Which of the following is the least likely physiological change in pregnancy,Increase in intravascular volume,Increase in cardiac output,Increase in stroke volume,Increase in peripheral vascular resistance,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. increase in peripheral vascular resistance Hemodynamic changes during pregnancyThe most important point to remember about cardiovascular changes during pregnancy is that in normal pregnant patients, circulation is hyperdynamic and that a high cardiac output is present.The increase in cardiac output starts about 10 weeks into the pregnancy reaches the maximum at about 24-28 weeks and remains elevated until parturition.The rise in cardiac output is initially determined by increase in stroke volume and later on as the pregnancy advances the heart rate also increases.An increase in intravascular volume is one of the main determinants of the increased cardiac output of pregnancy.There is an increase in both red cell volume and plasma volume.A good clinical marker of the presence of an expanded I. V. volume during pregnancy is the presence of grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.This physiologic murmur appears at about 10-12 weeks into the pregnancy and disappears in the beginning of the postpartum period.The increase in the intravascular volume fulfills the needs of the developing uteroplacental circulation and protects the mother against the potentially harmful effects of the blood loss that occurs at parturition.The increase in blood volume of pregnancy does not alter the central venous pressure (CVP), which is the same as in the nonpregnant women.Another important hemodynamic change in pregnancy is decreased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR).PVR decreases during pregnancy on the arterial side and the venous side of the circulation. The cause of this change is not well understood, but is most likely a direct effect of placental hormones or vasodilator prostaglandins (prostacyclins) on blood vessels.The decreased peripheral vascular resistance is manifested clinically by a decrease in both mean and diastolic blood pressure. This decrease is clearly observed during second trimester.Because most of the intravascular volume is contained in the capacitance vessels, the decrease in venous resistance represents the adaptation of the vascular tree to the blood volume expansion. If this adaptation does not occur, thev. volume will not expand, thereby seriously compromising the uteroplacental circulation.Hemodynamic changes in normal pregnancy*Cardiac output- Increased*Heart rate- Increased*Systemic vascular resistance- Increased*Pulmonary vascular resistance- Increased*Mean arterial pressure- Increased*Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure- Increased*Central venous pressure- Normal*Left ventricular stroke volume- IncreasedAlso knowThere are several periods during pregnancy when the danger of cardiac decompensation is especially great.First is between 12 and 32 weeks of gestation, a time during which hemodynamic changes of pregnancy develops.The most critical period is between 28-32 weeks of gestation, when the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy peak and cardiac demands are maximum.The other dangerous time for pregnant cardiac patient is during labour and delivery.During labour every uterine contractions injects blood from the uteroplacental circulation into the maternal blood stream increasing the cardiac output by approximately 15% to 20%.This continuous demand on the heart may trigger congestive heart failure,During the second stage of labour, maternal pushing further compromises the venous return to the heart causing a decrease in cardiac output that may be critical for some cardiac patients.The final dangerous time for the pregnant cardiac patient is 4-5 days after delivery.Patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger's syndrome, Aortic stenosis and cyanotic heart disease may be able to go through pregnancy and labour and delivery without major complications.However, sudden death in the early postpartum period may occur. Decreased peripheral resistance with right to left shunting and pulmonary embolization from silent iliofemoral thrombus are two problems occurring at this time.",D

Viral hepatitis (HAV, HBV)
Eclampsia, preeclampsia (HELLP syndrome)
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
Budd-Chiari syndrome.

Let us discuss each option separately
Preeclampsia and eclampsia/HELLP syndrome:

It is the most common cause of abnormal liver function test in women.
Amniotransferases are modestly elevated.
But in these cases delivery of the fetus is followed by rapid normalization of the hepatic abnormalities.
Moreover the question does not mention any history of PIH, hemolysis and thrombocytopenia (HELLP syndrome).

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy:

Acute fatty liver develops in the third trimester.
Jaundice develops a few days after the onset. The serum bilirubin is rarely above 10 mg/dL.
Alkaline phosphate is markedly elevated.
Aminotransferases are moderately elevated.
A markedly raised serum ammonia is the most diagnostic finding in establishing the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and symptoms rapidly abate with parturition in most patients.

Fulminant hepatic failure:

The patient presents with features of severe acute hepatitis leading to the development of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks of onset.
The bilirubin increases to 20-30 mg/dL.
The aminotransferase levels are very high (>1000)
Alkaline phosphatase moderately elevated.
Delivery is usually the best treatment.

Budd-Chiari syndrome:

It is a disorder characterized by thrombotic occlusion of the hepatitis veins.
It is a rare complication of pregnancy.
Most of the cases presents within few weeks of delivery but in several cases onset occurs during pregnancy.
Clinical triad of Budd-Chiari syndrome includes sudden onset of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and ascites (ascites with high protein content is almost always present) near term or shortly after delivery.
Tender hepatomegaly is one of the hallmark of Budd-Chiari syndrome.
Aminotransferases are mildly elevated.

"In neonatal cholestasis, if the serum gamaglutamyl–transpeptidase (gamma GTP) is more than 600 IU/L the most likely diagnosis is –",Neonatal hepatitis,Choledochal cyst,Sclerosing cholangitis,Biliary atresia,"Neonatal cholestasis

Neonatal cholestasis is defined as prolonged elevation of serum levels of conjugated bilirubin beyond the first 14 days of life.
Neonatal cholestasis can be divided into extrahepatic and intrahepatic disease and clinical features of any form of cholestasis are more or less similar.
Neonatal hepatitis is the prototype of intrahepatic cholestasis
Biliary atresia is the prototype of extrahepatic biliary atresia

Enzymes that reflect cholestasis: There are three enzymes that are usually elevated in cholestasis

Alkaline phosphatase → Found in or near bile canalicular membrane of hepatocytes
5' nucleotidase
Gamma glutainyl transpeptidase → Located in the endoplasmic reticulum and in bile duct epithelial cells.


Because GGT is more diffusely localized in the liver, its elevation in serum is less specific than are the elevation of Alkaline phosphatase & 5' nucleotidase.
Nevertheless, the following distinction is worthwhile.

'GGT levels are commonly elevated to values more than 10 times normal in biliary atresia while in hepatic causes it is raised to about three times normal.'
Normal values for GGT is about 5-40 IU/L and thus a value of 600 IU/L in the patient in question reflects an elevation of more than ten times the normal value. The patient is thus likely suffering from `biliary atresia'.",D

Weight gain in pregnancy is related to all except:,Ethnicity,Smoking,Socio economic status,Pre conceptional weight,"Average maternal weight gain during pregnancy is 11-12 kg
Factors which affect maternal weight gain during pregnancy are:

Pre pregnancy weight: If the pre pregnancy weight is more than normal (obese), there is a tendency to gain excessive weight during pregnancy.
Race and ethnicity: American women tend to put on more weight during pregnancy as compared to Asians and Africans.
Socio economic status: Women from higher socio economic group have more weight gain as compared to women from lower socio economic group. This is because malnutrition prevents optimum weight gain.
Associated conditions like women with gestational/over diabetes mellitus, twins and polyhydramnios have higher weight gain during pregnancy
Parity: Multigravida females tend to gain less weigh than primigravida

Smoking does not affect maternal weight gain during pregnancy, Smoking affects fetal weight gain and is one of the causes of IUGR.
“Studies have, indicated a lack of relationship between smoking and maternal weight gain while demonstrating a direct relationship between smoking and fetal grown rate.” 
Remember:
Rapid weight gain, i.e. more than 0.5 kg a week or 2 kg per month is an early manifestation of preeclampsia.

Low grade squamous Intraepithelial leison of cervix in Bethseda system includes :,CIN 1,CIN 2,CIN 3,Squamous metaplasia,"Dysplasias are graded as: 1. Mild dysplasia (CIN-I). The undifferentiated cells are confined to the lower one-third of the epithelium. The cells are more differentiated towards the surface. Mild dysplasia due to infection is often seen in young women indulging in sexual activity. CIN-I is lately described as low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) according to the Bethesda classification. 'Ascus' is a term described in the Bethesda system as atypical cells of undetermined significance. The intermediate cells mostly display mild dysplasia with enlarged nuclei and irregular outline. One per cent progress to cancer over the years. 2. Moderate dysplasia (CIN-II). Undifferentiated cells occupy the lower 50-75% of the epithelial thickness. The cells are mostly intermediate with moderate nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia, irregular chromatin and multiple nucleation. Thiy per cent of CIN II regress, 40% persist and the rest progress to invasive cancer. 3. Severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (CIN-III). In this grade of dysplasia, the entire thickness of the epithelium is replaced by abnormal cells. There is no cornification and stratification is lost. The basement membrane, however, is intact and there is no stromal infiltration. Often, an abrupt change in histological appearance from normal to abnormal is apparent. The cytology cells are mostly parabasal with increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. The nuclei are irregular, with coarse chromatin material; mitosis and multinucleation are common. Almost all progress to invasive cancer over 10-15 years. 4. Tadpole cells are seen in invasive cancer. CIN-II and CIN-III are described as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) according to the latest Bethesda classification. HSIL have a propensity to progress and become invasive, and therefore need investigations and treatment.In cervix , low grade squamous Intraepithelial leison ( LSIL ) in 2001 Bethseda system includes cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I Reference: Textbook of Gynaecology; 16th edition; Pg no:486",A

"30-year-old G3P2 patient visits an antenatal clinic at 20 weeks. She reveals during history that her first baby was 4.6 kg delivered by cesarean section, second baby was 4-8 kg delivered by c/section. Gynaecologists suspects gestational diabetes and orders a GCT.

As discussed in the text – in gestational diabetes, blood sugar levels are raised beyond 20-24 weeks of pregnancy, due to insulin resistance and hence free radicals (responsible for causing congenital malformations) are formed after 20-24 weeks and therefore it does not lead to congenital malformation as organogenesis is already complete by this age.

Edema in nephrotic syndrome is due to ?,Sodium & water retention,Increased venous pressure,Hypoalbuminemia,Hyperlipidemia,"Ans.C.)Hypoalbuminemia Nephrotic syndrome It is a syndrome comprising signs of nephrosis, chiefly protein in the urine, low blood albumin levels, and swelling. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by large proteinuria (>3.5 g per 1.73 m2 body surface area per day, or > 40 mg per square meter body surface area per hour in children), hypoalbuminemia (< 2,5 g/dl), hyperlipidaemia, and edema (which is generalized and also known as anasarca or dropsy) that begins in the face. Lipiduria (lipids in urine) can also occur, but is not essential for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Hyponatremia also occurs with a low fractional sodium excretion. The most common sign is excess fluid in the body due to the serum hypoalbuminemia. Lower serum oncotic pressure causes fluid to accumulate in the interstitial tissues. Sodium and water retention aggravates the edema.",C
A new born child developed respiratory depression in neonatal ward. Which of the following drug is the cause aEUR',Opioids,Barbiturates,Diazepam,Propofol,"Opioids Epidural opioid (fentanyl) analgesia is commonly employed as a therapeutic modality in the management of pain during labour. The general perception is that administered drugs remain in the maternal epidural space and do not compromise the respiratory status of the newborn. Contrary to the widely held belief fentanyl diffuses freely from the epidural space into the maternal blood because of its high lipid solubility. Equilibrium is reached within 10-30 min. The drug is freely transpoed across the placenta with a slightly higher concentration in the, fetal compament because of a comparative acidic pH. There is no consensus on the dose of fentanyl causing respiratory depression in the newborn period. However, it appears that neonates are prone to respiratory depression at a lower concentration because of the immaturity of the respiratory centre. According to the Cochrane analysis Morphine, meperidine and fentanyl are the opioids that have been studied the most in labour analgesia research. These opioids as well as newer alternatives, such as nalbuphine have been associated with newborn respiratory depression at bih. - Opioids are known for their high lipid solubility which allows rapid transfer of the drug through the placenta and into the fetus. - The risk of respiratory depression is highest if bih occurs at the time of peak fetal uptake between 1-4 hours after administration of drug to the mother. - Repeated doses of opioids results in significant .fetal exposure and neonatal respiratory depression. Opioids are also used in neonates for pain management - They are the mainstay of pain management in newborn. - In newborns the clearance is diminished and elimination half lives are prolonged as compared to adults because of the immaturity of hepatic cytochrome system of the neonates. - Therefore opioid administration may result in opioid accumulation and respiratory depression.",A

The age and type of presentation depend on the tightness of the ring. About 75% with a double aoic arch, 55% with a right aoic arch & abberant left subclan aery and 95% with compression by an abberant innominate aery present in infancy with repiratory symptoms, including stridor, persistent cough and frequent respiratory illnesses. If the vascular ring produces compression of the trachea and esophagus, symptoms are frequently present during infancy. Chronic wheezing is exacerbated by crying, feeding, and flexion of the neck. Extension of the neck tends to relieve the noisy respiration. Vomiting may also be a component. Affected infants may have a brassy cough, pneumonia, or sudden death from aspiration. Others can present in later childhood or even as teenagers or young adults with a history of respiratory symptoms that mimic asthma or exercise-induced asthma. Some are diagnosed later in life after being asymptomatic during entire childhood. The later the presentation, the more chances of gastrointestinal symptoms being the presenting symptoms.

All of the following are associated with pathogenesis of acute hydrops fetalis except: September 2009,Hypoproteinemia,Anemia,Hypoplasia of placental tissue,Metabolic acidosis,"Ans. C: Hypoplasia of Placental Tissue Several hypotheses regarding the pathophysiologic events that lead to fetal hydrops have been suggested. The basic mechanism for the formation of fetal hydrops is an imbalance of interstitial fluid production and the lymphatic return. The fetus is paicularly susceptible to interstitial fluid accumulation because of its greater capillary permeability, compliant interstitial compaments, and vulnerability to venous pressure on lymphatic return. In Rh hemolytic disease, there is excessive destruction of RBC's leading to anemia, tissue anoxemia and metabolic acidosis. There is hyperplasia of placental tissue in an effo to increase the transfer of oxygen. As a result of anoxemai there is damage to liver resulting in hypoproteinemia. Fluid accumulation in the fetus can result from congestive hea failure, obstructed lymphatic flow, or decreased plasma osmotic pressure.",C

Which one of the following perinatal infections has the highest risk of fetal infection in the first trimester?,Hepatitis B virus,Syphilis,Toxoplasmosis,Rubella,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Rubella * Rubella is one of the most teratogenic agents known. Eighty percent of women with rubella infection and a history of rash during the first 12 weeks have a fetus with congenital infection. At 13-14 weeks, the incidence is about 54%, and it is 25% by the end of the second trimester. As the duration of pregnancy increases, fetal infections are less likely to cause congenital malformations.* In order to prevent rubella during pregnancy and congenital rubella syndrome, ACOG recommends that the MMR vaccine should be offered to women of childbearing age who do not have evidence of immunity whenever they make contact with the health-care system. Vaccination of susceptible women should-1) Be part of routine general medical and gynecological care, including college health services.2) Take place in all family planning settings.3) Be provided routinely to unimmunized women immediately after hospitalization, childbirth, or abortion, unless there are specific contraindications.* Vaccination of all susceptible hospital personnel who might be exposed to patients with rubella or who might have contact with pregnant women is recommended. Rubella vaccination should be avoided 1 month before or during pregnancy because the vaccine contains attenuated live virus.* In toxoplasmosis, the incidence and severity of congenital infection depend on the gestational age of the fetus at the time of maternal primary infection. Infection increases with duration of pregnancy, with the risk the fetal infection rising from 6% at 13 weeks to 72% at 36 weeks. Fetal infection is more virulent the earlier the infection is acquired. Treatment of pregnant women is thought to prevent and reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of congenital infection. Spiramycin, used alone, is thought to reduce the risk of congenital infection but not to treat established fetal infection. When fetal infection in diagnosed by prenatal testing, pyrimethamine, sulfonamides and folinic acid are added to spiramycin to eradicate parasites in the placenta and fetus.* Transmission of syphilis from a syphilitic mother to her fetus across the placenta may occur at any stage of pregnancy, but the lesions of congenital syphilis generally develop after the fourth month of gestation, when fetal immunologic competence begins to develop.* Perinatal transmission of hepatitis B occurs primarily in infants born to HbsAg carrier mothers or mothers with acute hepatitis B during the third trimester of pregnancy or during the early postpartum period. Most infections occur approximately at the time of delivery and are not related to breast feeding.",D
Myopathy is seen in all except,Myopathy is seen in all except,X-linked hypophatemic rickets,Oncogenic osteomalacia,Nutritional osteomalacia,".Myopathies in systemic disease results from several different disease processes including endocrine, inflammatory, paraneoplastic, infectious, drug- and toxin-induced, critical illness myopathy, metabolic, collagen related, and myopathies with other systemic disorders. Patients with systemic myopathies often present acutely or sub acutely. On the other hand, familial myopathies or dystrophies generally present in a chronic fashion with exceptions of metabolic myopathies where symptoms on occasion can be precipitated acutely. Most of the inflammatory myopathies can have a chance association with malignant lesion; the incidence appears to be specifically increased only in patients with dermatomyositis. There are many types of myopathy. ICD-10codes are provided here where available. Inherited formsEdit (G71.0) Dystrophies (or muscular dystrophies) are a subgroup of myopathies characterized by muscle degeneration and regeneration. Clinically, muscular dystrophies are typically progressive, because the muscles' ability to regenerate is eventually lost, leading to progressive weakness, often leading to use of a wheelchair, and eventually death, usually related to respiratory weakness. (G71.1) Myotonia Neuromyotonia (G71.2) The congenital myopathies do not show evidence for either a progressive dystrophic process (i.e., muscle death) or inflammation, but instead characteristic microscopic changes are seen in association with reduced contractile ability of the muscles. Congenital myopathies include, but are not limited to: (G71.2) nemaline myopathy(characterized by presence of 'nemaline rods' in the muscle), (G71.2) multi/minicore myopathy(characterized by multiple small 'cores' or areas of disruption in the muscle fibers), (G71.2) centronuclear myopathy (or myotubular myopathy) (in which the nuclei are abnormally found in the center of the muscle fibers), a rare muscle wasting disorder (G71.3) Mitochondrial myopathies, which are due to defects in mitochondria, which provide a critical source of energy for muscle (G72.3) Familial periodic paralysis (G72.4) Inflammatory myopathies, which are caused by problems with the immune system attacking components of the muscle, leading to signs of inflammationin the muscle (G73.6) Metabolic myopathies, which result from defects in biochemical metabolism that primarily affect muscle (G73.6/E74.0) Glycogen storage diseases, which may affect muscle (G73.6/E75) Lipid storage disorder (G72.89) Other myopathies Brody myopathy Congenital myopathy with abnormal subcellular organelles Fingerprint myopathy Inclusion body myopathy 2 Megaconial myopathy Myofibrillar myopathy Rimmed vacuolar myopathy AcquiredEdit (G72.0 - G72.2) External substance induced myopathy (G72.0) Drug-induced myopathy Glucocoicoid myopathy is caused by this class of steroids increasing the breakdown of the muscle proteins leading to muscle atrophy.

"A pregnant women, previous LSCS with hematuria. Diagnosis is?",Impending scar rupture of uterus,Prolonged labour,Uretreral injury,Cystitis,"Prolonged labour Make it clear once and for all:? 'Hematuria is not a feature of impending scar rupture'. How would an impending scar produce hematuria??? Hentaturia indicates bladder involvement - In some cases of uterine rupture, bladder rupture can also occur. These cases of utrine rupture presents with hematuria. 'So hematuria in a case of uterine rupture indicates that rupture has actually taken place, it is not impending'. 'Hematuria only occurs in uterine rupture when rupture has actually occurred and involved bladder too'. A common cause of hematuria during labour is obstructed labour. 'In obstructed labour the bladder becomes an abdominal organ and due to compression of urethra between the presenting pa and symphysis pubis, the patient .fails to empty the bladder. The transverse depression at the junction of the superior border of the bladder and the distended lower segment is often confused with the Bandls's ring. The bladder wall gets traumatized which may lead to blood stained urine, a common finding in obstructed labour'. Clinical features of impending scar rupture: ? Tenderness over the site of uterine scar. Uterine contractions become tetanic. Signs of extreme fetal distress or death. Maternal tachycardia. Slight elevation in maternal temperature.",B

"Side effect of Depot MPA are all, EXCEPT",Weight gain,Irregular bleeding,Amenorrhea,Hepatitis,Ans. is d i.e Hepatitis DMPA i.e. depot medroxy progesterone acetate (depot provera) and Net en are progesterone only injectable contraceptives DMPA-. It is administered as an intramuscular injection every 3 monthsdeg (150mg every 3month). Mechanism of action : Same as other progesterone contraceptive i.e. thickening of cervical mucus and endometrial atrophy making it less receptive to implantation and by inhibiting ovulation by blocking LH surge. Suited ideally for : -- Lactating womendeg In sickle cell diseasedeg (as it makes sickle cell crisis less frequent and less painful) -- In seizure disorder (as it raises seizure threshold). Other advantages : -- Has no cardiovascular risk -- No excess risk of breast cancer -- Has all benefits of progesterone component as in OCP's (see 0. No. 11). Side effect of DMPA include : Irregular bleeding / Poor cycle controldeg (Most common side effect) Occasional phase of amenorrheadeg Weight gaindeg Prolonged infeility after its usedeg (Ovulation begins 6 - 12 months after the last injection) Breast tenderness Decreased bone mass (after prolonged use) so women shold be advised to use calcium supplementation.

Commonest uterine anomaly is: March 2007,Uterus unicornis,Uterus bicornis,Uterus didelphys,Subseptate uterus,"Ans. B: Uterus Bicornis Uterine malformation is the result of an abnormal development of the Mullerian duct. Class I: Mullerian agenesis (absent uterus). - Uterus is not present, vagina only rudimentary or absent. - The condition is also called Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. - The patient with MRKH syndrome will have primary amenorrhoea. Class II: unicornuate uterus (a one-sided uterus). - Only one side of the Mullerian duct forms. - The uterus has a typical 'penis shape' on imaging systems. Class III: Uterus didelphys (double uterus). - Both Mullerian ducts develop but fail to fuse, thus the patient has a 'double uterus'. - This may be a condition with a double cervix and a vaginal paition (v.i.), or the lower Mullerian system fused into its unpaired condition. Class IV: Bicornuate uterus (uterus with two horns). - Only the upper pa of that pa of the Mullerian system that forms the uterus fails to fuse, thus the caudal pa of the uterus is normal, the cranial pa is bifurcated. - The uterus is 'hea-shaped'. Uterus bicornis unicolis is the most common. Class V: septated uterus (uterine septum or paition). The two Mullerian ducts have fused, but the paition between them is still present, splitting the system into two pas. - With a complete septum the vagina, cervix and the uterus can be paitioned. Usually the septum affects only the cranial pa of the uterus. - MRI is considered the preferred modality due to its multiplanar capabilities as well as its ability to evaluate the uterine contour, junctional zone, and other pelvic anatomy. - A hysterosalpingogram is not considered as useful due to the inability of the technique to evaluate the exterior contour of the uterus and distinguish between a bicornuate and septate uterus. - Class VI: DES uterus. The uterine cavity has a 'T-shape' as a result of fetal exposure to Diethylstilbestrol. Arcuate uterus where there is a concave dimple in the uterine fundus within the cavity. A rudimentary uterus is a uterine remnant not connected to cervix and vagina and may be found on the other side of an unicornuate uterus. Patients with uterine abnormalities may have associated renal abnormalities including unilateral renal agenesis.",B

Treatment with clomiphene citrate should be limited to ---- ovulatory cycles?,3,6,10,12,"Clomiphene citrate is a weak synthetic estrogen that mimics the activity of an estrogen antagonist when given at typical pharmacologic doses for the induction of ovulation.A functional hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is usually required for appropriate clomiphene citrate action. More specifically, clomiphene citrate is thought to bind and block estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus for prolonged periods, thereby decreasing the normal ovarian-hypothalamic estrogen feedback loop. This blockade increases GnRH pulsatility, leading to increased pituitary secretion of gonadotropins, which promote ovarian follicular development.Treatment should be limited to 6 ovulatory cycles or 12 total cycles.Reference: Novak's Gynecology; 14th edition; Chapter 32; Infeility and Assisted Reproductive Technology",B

PDA results in left to right shunt from the aoa to the pulmonary aery. The flow occurs both during systole and diastole as a pressure gradient is present throughout the cardiac cycle between the 2 great aeries. This flow of blood results in continuous murmur it is usually heard at 2nd left interspace. In patients with large left to right shunt a low pitched mitral mid diastolic murmur is audible at the apex, owing to the increased volume of blood flow across the mitral valve. o There are other conditions which can produce systolic and diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area such as Aoopulmonary window defect.",A

Red degeneration in uterine fibroid is most common in :,Second trimester,Third trimester,Puerperium,First trimester,"Ans. is a i.e. Second trimester Friends, answer to this question was quite obvious as each one of us have mugged it up; but finding an appropriate reference was a difficult task. Read for yourself whatDutta Obs. 6/e, p 309 has to say? 'Red Degeneration; It predominantly occurs in a large fibroid during the second half of pregnancy or puerperium.' From the above statement answer could be second trimester, third trimester or puerperium. 'Red degeneration; manifests typically about midpregnancy when the leiomyoma suddenly become acutely painful, enlarged and tender.' This clears the doubts and confirms our answer i.e Red degeneration is most common during second trimester (midpregnancy). Friends you should also keep in mind the following impoant points regarding - Fibroids and pregnancy. Effects of Fibroid on pregnancy : Infeility - Leiomyomas are a sole cause of infeility in less than 30/0 of cases.deg - It causes infeility by : Hindering the ascent of the spermatozoa by distoing the uterus and tubes. By disturbances in ovulation and By interfering with implantation of the feilized ovum. - Pregnancy rate following myomectomy = 40%deg Aboiondeg, Placental abruptiondeg and Premature labourdeg. Occurs when fibroid interferes with enlargement of uterus, initiates abnormal uterine contractions or prevents efficient placentation, Ma!positiondeg and Malpresentationdeg of Fetus : occur as fibroid can prevent engagement of head. Obstructed labour : It can be caused by cervicaldeg and broad ligament tumoursdeg which are fixed in the pelvis and by pedunculated subserous leiomyomas which become trapped in the pouch of Douglas. During labour - If fibroid is situated above the presenting pa - uneventful vaginal delivery. - If fibroid is situated below the presenting pa spontaneous vaginal delivery may occur; otherwise caesarean section is done. Thus chances of cesarean section are increased.deg Post Paum Hemorrhagedeg /Delayed Involutiondeg can occur if placenta is implanteddeg over the leiomyoma.

Management of necrotizing enterocolitis

Medical treatment of NEC include
Cessation of feeding
Nasogastric decompression
Administration of i.v. fluids
Systemic antibiotic against both gram +ve as well as gram -ye bacteria (after taking samples for blood culture).
Ventilation should be assisted if distention is contributing to hypoxia.
Early surgery consultation

Surgical interventions in NEC

Evidence of perforation is an indication for laparotomy and resection of necrotic bowel.
Failure to respond to medical management, a single fixed bowel loop, erythema of the abdominal wall and a palpable mass are additional indications of exploratory laparotomy, resection of necrotic bowel and external ostomy diversion.
Peritoneal drainage may be helpful for patients with peritonitis who are too unstable to withstand surgery. It is more successful in patients with isolated intestinal perforation. In many patients, no further surgical procedure is required.
Peritoneal drainage is performed under local anaesthesia. Alpenrose drain is placed in the right lower quadrant and permitted to drain peritoneal contents and decompress the abdomen. This procedure is employed predominantly in infants less than 1000g who have severe SIRS and are viewed as too unstable to be transported or to undergo laparotomy. In experienced hands, one-third of the patients require only drain placement.
A primary anastomosis at the time of initial surgery is indicated in patients with limited localized disease who have no distal bowel involvement and in patients who have demonstrated a walled-off perforation who are no longer manifesting the SIRS.

From this discussion, we choose the answer to be peritoneal drainage because:

Patients are on a ventilator (too unstable).
Surgery for NEC is resection and creation of an ileostomy, which is not given in the options.
Primary anastomosis is done only in stable patients with walled-off perforation.",D

The following are the fetures of ss thalassemia major except,Bone marrow hyperplasia,Hair-on-end appearance,Splenomegaly,Increased osmotic fragility,"In thalassemia major osmotic fragility is reduced. Patients with the beta thalassemia trait generally have no unusual physical findings. In patients with beta thalassemia major, the physical findings are related to severe anemia, ineffective erythropoiesis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and iron overload resulting from transfusion and increased iron absorption. The skin may show pallor from anemia and jaundice from hyperbilirubinemia, and the skull and other bones may be deformed secondary to erythroid hyperplasia with intramedullary expansion and coical bone thinning. Skin ulceration may be present on the extremities. Thalassemia can result in maxillary enlargement, leading to an appearance known as chipmunk face, along with increased spaces between teeth, overbite, and malocclusion. Painful swelling of salivary glands and a dry mouth may occur, which leads to reduced salivary protection and an increased rate of tooth decay. Cardiac examination may reveal hea failure and arrhythmia (eg, atrial fibrillation), related to either severe anemia or iron overload. Abdominal examination may reveal changes in the liver, gallbladder, and spleen. Hepatomegaly related to significant extramedullary hematopoiesis is typically found. Patients who have received blood transfusions may have hepatomegaly or chronic hepatitis due to iron overload. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",D

Best Investigation to assess tubal patency :,Rubin's test,HSG,Laparotomy,Laparoscopic chromtubation,"Ans. is d i.e. Laparoscopic chromotubation The Gold standard / Best Investigation to assess tubal patency is Laparoscopic chromotubation. Laparoscopy enables to look at the external condition of uterus, tubes and pelvis and at the same time the patency of tubes can be seen . Methylene Blue/Indigo carmine dye is injected through a cannula attached to the cervix to visualize the free spill or absence of spill. It can also demonstrate peritubal adhesions and unsuspected endometriosis. The greatest advantage of laparoscopy is therapeutic procedure can be performed if adhesions or fimbrial block is recognized in one sitting. Also know : Other questions frequently asked on Tuba! patency tests. - Time for performing Tuba! patency tests : Day 6 - Day 11 of cycledeg - No anesthesia is required for tube testingdeg - Obsolete method of testing Tubal patency - Rubins test / Insufflation testdeg - Contraindiactions of tubal Patency tests. HSG should not be performed during and immediately before menstruation and in the post ovulatory period. HSG should not be performed after curettage. In recently active salphingttis. In suspected Tuberculosis of Genital Tract. In infection of the lower Genital tract. Sonosalpingography is a method of assessing Tube Patency. It was popularized by G.Allahabadia and is also called as Sion test : Under USG guidance, a slow and deliberate injection of 200 ml of physiological saline into uterine cavity is accomplished a foley's catheter, the inflated bulb of which lies above the internal os and prevents leakage. It is possible to visualize the flow of saline along the tube and observe it is coming out as a shower at fimbrial end. USG shows the presence of free fluid in pouch of Douglas if tubes are patent. Falloscopy -The interstitial end of the fallopian tubes is visualised by falloscopy. Salpingoscopy-Studies the mucosa of the fallopian tube and helps in deciding whether IVF or tubal microsurgery should be performed.",D

Estrogen administration in a menopausal woman increases the,Gonadotrophin secretion,LDL -- cholesterol,Bone mass,Muscle mass,"Ans. is c i.e Bone mass Before seeing any Reference for the Question let's rule out some options. Estrogen administration will exe a negative feedback on gonadotropin secretion and decreases Gonadotropin secretion rather than increasing it (Option 'a' ruled out). As I have already discussed in previous Question -Estrogen decreases LDL and not increases it (ruling out Option `b). Now we are left with 2 options, Option 'c' i.e. Bone mass and Option 'rile. Muscle mass. Estrogen given as hormone replacement therapy is most beneficial in preventing osteoporosis i.e it must be increasing bone mass. So, Option 'c'seems to be correct. Now have a look what texts have to say : Estrogen helps to maintain bone mass and skeletal integrity thereby protecting against osteoporosis. Effect of estrogen on bones : Estrogen causes increased osteoblastic activity in the bones. It is impoant in maintaining bone mass primarily by retarding bone resorption. The major action of estrogen is directed at reducing the maturation and activity of osteoclasts, by modifying regulatory cytokine signals from osteoblasts. The action of estrogen and progesterone result in increased expression of bone matrix proteins such as osteonectin, osteocalcin, collagen and alkaline phosphatase.

BMD is expressed as a T score, which is the number of standard detions from the mean for a young healthy woman. A T score above --1 is considered normal, a value between --1 and --2.5 denotes osteopenia and a score below --2.5 indicates osteoporosis. Evaluation of BMD by DXA is recommended for all women aged 65 and older, regardless of risk factors and for younger postmenopausal women with 1 or more risk factors.

All are features of absence seizures except –,Usually seen in childhood,3–Hz spike wave in EEG,Postictal confusion,Precipitation by hyperventilation,"'Absence seizures are characterized by sudden brief lapse of consciousness without loss of postural control. The seizure typically lasts for only seconds, consciousness returns as suddenly as it was lost and there is no postural confusion'. - Harrison
Absence seizures: (Petitmal seizures)

Begin in childhood (4-8 years) or early adolescence and are the main seizure type in children with epilepsy.
There is sudden brief loss of consciousness, which lasts for a few seconds.
No loss of posture                                       
No breathing difficulty
No incontinence of urine or stool
May be accompanied by subtle bilateral motor signs such as
Rapid blinking of eyelids                        
Small amplitude clonic movements of the hands
Chewing movements
Absence seizures may occur in multiple every day (can occur hundreds of times per day)
The electrophysiological hallmark of typical absence seizure is a generalized symmetric 3 Hz spike and slow wave discharge that begins and ends suddenly on a normal EEG background.
Hyperventilation tends to provoke these electrographic discharge and even the seizure themselves and is routinely used when recording the EEG.
Hyperventilation often precipitates the attacks.
Drug of choice for absence seizures is Valproate (Previously it was ethosuxamide).",C

Following fetal tocographic finding was seen in a 30- year- old female patient in labor. What does it suggest?,Early cord compression,Fetal distress,Head compression,Fetal anemia,"Ans. b. Fetal distress (Ref: Williams Obstetrics 24/e p340) Late decelerations, typical of fetal distress can be seen in the given fetal tocography. Methods of Monitoring Fetal Heart Rate Fetal stethoscope (Pinard) & Hand-held Doppler (Sonicaid) Cardiotocograph (CTG) Cardiotocography (CTG) CTG: Technical means of recording (-graphy) fetal heartbeat (cardio-) & uterine contractions (-toco-) during pregnancy, typically in third trimester. The machine used to perform the monitoring is called a Cardiotocograph, more commonly known as an Electronic Fetal Monitor (EFM). Two separate transducers perform recordings, one for the measurement of fetal heart rate & second one for uterine contractions. Types of measurement: Each of the transducers may be either external or internal. External measurement means taping or strapping the two sensors to the abdominal wall. This is called an indirect measure. Internal measurement (direct) requires a certain degree of cervical dilatation, as it involves insetting a pressure catheter into the uterine cavity, as well as attaching a scalp electrode to the childs head to adequately measure the electric activity of the fetal heart. Interpretation: Includes description of uterine activity (contractions), baseline fetal heart rate, baseline FHR variability, presence of accelerations, periodic or episodic decelerations The 3 primary mechanisms by which uterine contractions can cause a decrease in fetal heart rate are compression of fetal head, umbilical cord & uterine myometrial vesselsQ. Variability Baseline variability refers to the variation of fetal heart rate from one beat to the next. Variability occurs as a result of the interaction between nervous system, chemoreceptors. baroreptors & cardiac responsiveness. This is because a healthy foetus will constantly be adapting it's heart rate to respond to changes in it's environment. Normal variability is between 10-25 bpm To calculate variability you look at how much the peaks & troughs of the heart rate deviate from baseline rate (in bpm) Variability can be categorised as: Reassuring > 5 bpmQ Non-reassuring <5 bpm for between 40-90 minutesQ Abnormal <5 bpm for >90 minutesQ Accelerations Abrupt increase in baseline heart rate of >15 bpm for >15 secondsQ The presence of accelerations is reassuring Antenatally there should be at least 2 accelerations every 15 minutesQ Accelerations occurring alongside uterine contractions is a sign of a healthy foetusQ Decelerations Decelerations: Abrupt decrease in baseline heart rate of >15 bpm for > 15 seconds Types of deceleration Early deceleration * Start when uterine contraction begins & recover when uterine contraction stops * Due to increased foetal intracranial pressure causing increased vagal tone * Resolves once the uterine contraction ends & intracranial pressure reduces * Considered to be physiological & not pathological Variable deceleration * Seen as a rapid fall in baseline rate with a variable recovery phase * Variable in their duration & may not have any relationship to uterine contractions * Seen during labour & in patients with reduced amniotic fluid volume * Variable decelerations are usually caused by umbilical cord compression * The umbilical vein is often occluded first causing an acceleration in response * Then the umbilical artery is occluded causing a subsequent rapid deceleration * When pressure on the cord is reduced another acceleration occurs & then the baseline rate returns * Accelerations before & after a variable deceleration are known as the 'shoulders of deceleration' * Variable decelerations can sometimes resolve if the mother changes position * The presence of persistent variable decelerations indicates the need for close monitoring Late deceleration * Begin at the peak of uterine contraction & recover after the contraction ends. * Indicates there is insufficient blood flow through the uterus & placenta, foetal hypoxia & acidosis due to reduced uteroplacental blood flow. * If foetal blood pH is acidotic it indicates significant foetal hypoxia & the need for emergency C-section Prolonged deceleration * A deceleration that last more than 2 minutes * If it lasts between 2-3 minutes it is classed as non-reassuring * It it lasts longer than 3 minutes it is immediately classed as abnormal * Action must be taken quickly,e.g.. Foetal blood sampling/emergency C-section Sinusoidal Pattern A smooth, regular, wave-like pattern, frequency of around 2-5 cycles a minute, stable baseline rate around 120-160 bpm, no beat to beat variability It indicates severe foetal hypoxia, severe foetal anaemia, foetal/ maternal haemorrhageQ Management: Immediate C-section is indicated for this kind of pattern. Significance: This type of pattern is rare, however if present it is very serious, it is associated with high rates of foetal morbidity & mortality. Outcome is usually poor.",B
A newborn presented severe respiratory distress. On examination he was found to have scaphoid abdomen and absent breath sounds on left side of chest. The most likely diagnosis is:,Transient tachypnea of newborn,Congenital adenomatoid lung disease,Congenital Diaphragmatic hernia,Sequestration of lung,"Ans: c Congenital Diaphragmatic hernia). (Ref: Radiology Review Manual, 5th ed., 478)CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA# It is most common intrathoracic fetal anomaly due to absence of closure of pleuroperitoneal canal by 9th week of gestation# Congenital diaphragmatic hernia occur in two locations:- Posterolateral pleuroperitoneal canal (Bochdalek hernia)--common- Anteromedial pleuroperitoneal canal (Morgagni hernia)--rare# Left sided (Bochdalek) hernias are much more frequent than right sided.# On USG, congenital diaphragmatic hernia can be detected as early as at 17th week of gestation.# Small intestine in 88%, stomach in 60%, colon in 56%, spleen in 45%, liver in 51% and kidney in 22% chances of herniation into chest in Bochdalek hernia.# Mediastinal deviation is often seen first and is the most obvious USG sign of CDH.# Absolute diagnostic sign is visualization of peristalsis in chest and paradoxical motion of the abdominal contents on fetal inspiration.0# In Morgagni hernia, omentum and colon are the most frequent hernial contents. It is known to be associated with trisomy syndromes.# Presents as respiratory distress in neonatal period due to life threatening deficiency of small airways and alveoli, and scaphoid abdomen.# CXR:- Bowel loops in chest- Contralateral mediastinal shift- Complete/partial absence of diaphragm- Absence of stomach/small bowel in abdomenCongenital cystic adenomatoid lung malformation (CCAM/CALD)# It is congenital cystic abnormality of lung characterized by a interlobar mass of disorganized pulmonary tissue# Presents with respiratory distress and severe cyanosis in first week of life (66%) or within first year of life (90%)# Equal frequency in all lobes seen# Three types are known: microcystic, macrocystic and mixed type.# CXR:- Unilateral expansile mass with well-defined margins (80%)- Multiple air/occasionally fluid-filled- Compression of adjacent lung cysts- Contralateral mediastinal shift (87%)- Hypoplastic ipsilateral lung- Proper position of abdominal viscera- Spontaneous Pneumothorax (late sign)",C
The definition of hypeension in children is,"Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=95th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=2 occasions","Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=95th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=3 occasions","Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=90th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=2 occasions","Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=90th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=3 occasions","The definition of hypeension in adults is BP >=140/90 mm Hg, regardless of body size, sex, or age. This is a functional definition that relates level of BP elevation with the likelihood of subsequent cardiovascular events. Because hypeension-associated cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke, usually do not occur in childhood, the definition of hypeension in children is statistical rather than functional. The National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents published the Fouh Repo on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents (Fouh Repo) in 2004. This repo established normal values based on the normative distribution of BP in healthy children and included tables with systolic and diastolic values for the 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile by age, sex, and height percentile. The Fouh Repo defined hypeension as average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=95th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=3 occasions. Prehypeension was defined as average SBP or diastolic BP that is >=90th percentile but <95th percentile. In adolescents beginning at age 12 yr, prehypeension is defined as BP between 120/80 mm Hg and the 95th percentile. A child with BP levels >=95th percentile in a medical setting but normal BP outside of the office has white coat hypeension. The Fouh Repo fuher recommended that if BP is >=95th percentile, then hypeension should be staged. Children with BP between the 95th and 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg are categorized as stage 1 hypeension, and children with BP above the 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg have stage 2 hypeension. Stage 1 hypeension, if asymptomatic and without target organ damage, allows time for evaluation before staing treatment, whereas stage 2 hypeension calls for more prompt evaluation and pharmacologic therapy.

Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis in children is diagnosed by?,"Heavy proteinuria, high cholesterol, high ASO titre","Heavy proteinuria, hematuria, low titre","Mild proteinuria, high hematuria, high ASO titre","Mild proteinuria, high cholesterol, normal ASO titre","Ans. C. Mild proteinuria, high hematuria, high ASO titreAcute glomerulonephritis is a disease characterized by the sudden appearance of edema, hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension. It is a representative disease of acute nephritic syndrome in which inflammation of the glomerulus is manifested by proliferation of cellular elements secondary to an immunologic mechanism. Most commonly it results due to a preceding infection (hence PIGN). Most common organism implicated being streptococcal hence (PSGN)Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) results from an antecedent infection of the skin (impetigo) or throat (pharyngitis) caused by nephritogenic strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. The disease is most common in children 4-12 years of age and rare before 2 years of age or in those individuals older than 18 years. The latency period from infection may vary from 1 to 2 weeks after pharyngitis to 3 to 6 weeks after skin infections. The classic triad of gross hematuria, edema, and hypertension are the most common presenting symptoms. Hematuria is almost a universal finding with about one third of patients having gross hematuria. The dark urine is due to the oxidation of hemoglobin that turns brown after a prolonged time in an acidic environment. Gross hematuria may last up to 10 days and recur after a febrile illness. Recent poststreptococcal infection is most commonly demonstrated by serologic markers for elevated antibodies to extracellular streptococcal antigens.",C

Capillary refill time in a child with shock is?,>1 second,>2 seconds,>3 seconds,>4 seconds,"Capillary refill is a simple test that assesses how quickly blood returns to the skin after pressure is applied.
It is carried out by applying pressure to the pink part of the nail bed of the thumb or big toe in a child and over the sternum or forehead in a young infant for 3 seconds.
The capillary refill time is the time from release of pressure to complete return of the pink colour. It should be less than 3 seconds.
If it is more than 3 seconds the child may be in shock. Lift the limb slightly above heart level to assess arteriolar capillary refill and not venous stasis.

A 2-month-old child of an HIV-positive mother is followed in your pediatric practice. Which of the following therapies should be considered for this child?,Monthly evaluation for Kaposi sarcoma,Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (Pneumocystis carinii),Vitamin C supplementation,Oral polio virus vaccine,"In certain situations, such as in an infant born to an HIV-positive mother, prophylaxis against P jiroveci (formerly known as P carinii) infection is instituted. While awaiting final determination of this infant's HIV status, which can take several months, prophylaxis with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole starting at 6 weeks is usually appropriate.Severe anemia can be associated with AIDS and can require blood transfusion, especially if there is evidence of respiratory compromise. Bone marrow transplants in AIDS patients have been unsuccessful thus far because of the persistence of virus in macrophages throughout the body. HIV-positive and AIDS patients should receive primary and booster immunization with diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine, measlesmumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine (unless severely immunocompromised), hepatitis B vaccine, and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugated vaccine (HibCV). Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is recommended in place of oral polio vaccine (OPV) for all patients now (not just immunosuppressed patients) because of the theoretical risk of paralytic polio. If children with HIV are exposed to measles, they should receive a protective dose of measles immunoglobulin regardless of their immunization history. Pneumovax at age 2 and influenza vaccine are recommended annually. Eventually, all patients infected with HIV will lose weight and fail to grow. The factors responsible include reduced caloric intake because of poor appetite, intestinal malabsorption, and increased resting energy expenditure associated with chronic infection. Maintaining adequate nutrition in AIDS patients is very difficult, but vitamin C supplementation, by itself, has no special benefits. Kaposi sarcoma is rare in children.",B

Most specific but late Radiographic feature of Scurvy is,Ground Glass appearance of Shaft of long bones,Pencil Outlining of Epiphysis,White line of Frankel,Trummerfeld Zone at the Metaphysis,"Laboratory Findings and Diagnosis of ScurvyThe diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency is usually based on the characteristic clinical picture, the radiographic appearance of the long bones, and a history of poor vitamin C intake. The typical radiographic changes occur at the distal ends of the long bones and are paicularly common at the knees. The shafts of the long bones have a ground-glass appearance because of trabecular atrophy. The coex is thin and dense, giving the appearance of pencil outlining of the diaphysis and epiphysis. The white line of Frankel, an irregular but thickened white line at the metaphysis, represents the zone of well-calcified cailage. The epiphyseal centers of ossification also have a ground-glass appearance and are surrounded by a sclerotic ring. The more specific but late radiologic feature of scurvy is a zone of rarefaction under the white line at the metaphysis. This zone of rarefaction (Trummerfeld zone), a linear break in the bone that is proximal and parallel to the white line, represents the area of debris of broken-down bone trabeculae and connective tissue. A Pelkan spur is a lateral prolongation of the white line and may be present at coical ends.Reference: Nelson Textbook of Paediatrics; 20th edition; Chapter 50; Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)",D
Lactiferous duct of breast contraction is due to:,Progesterone,Estrogen,Oxytocin,Prolactin,"Ans. C. Oxytocin* Oxytocin primarily results in stimulation of two specific types of muscular contraction:* Uterine muscular contraction during parturition* Breast lactiferous duct myoepithelial contraction during milk let down reflex.A Brief on Breast Functional Anatomy* The areola is central, pigmented portion of breast with a diameter of about 2.5cm.* Accessory glands located around the periphery of the areola are Montgomery glands (they can secrete milk).* The nipple accommodates about 15-20 lactiferous ducts and their openings.* Each milk duct (lactiferous duct) dilates to form lactiferous sinus at about 5-10mm away from its opening in the nipple. Lactiferous sinus acts as reservoir of milk.* The lining epithelium of the duct near the opening is stratified squamous. Each alveolus is lined by columnar epithelium where milk secretion occurs.* Myoepithelial cells are the network of branching longitudinal striated cells which surround the alveoli and the smaller ducts. There is a dense network of capillaries surrounding the alveoli. These are situated between the basement membrane and epithelial lining.* Contraction of these cells (in response to oxytocin) squeezes the alveoli and ejects the milk into the larger duct",C

Which one of the following is the most common problem associated with the use of condom:,Increased monilial infection of vagina,Premature ejaculation,Contact dermatitis,Retention of urine,"Directions for use of condom

The condom should be put on by unrolling it over the erect penis after pulling back the foreskin, before there is any contact between the male and female organs. An airfree space should be left by squeezing the tip and holding it up, till it is unrolled fully for better collection of semen.
It should be used only once.
It should not be inflated for testing.
Vaseline oils, skin lotions, cold creams, should not be used as they increase the chance of rupture. If lubrication is needed, glycerine, K-Y jelly or spermicidal jelly can be used.
Soon after discharge, the male should withdraw the penis holding the condom firmly against his body
To increase the effectiveness, a dose of spermicidal jelly or foam tablet may be used at the same time. In case of breakage, slippage, or defective use, women should report or use emergency contraceptive within 72 hours and a spermicidal agent should be quicldy inserted into the vagina.

Advantages of condom

Condoms gives very good protection against STDs. These includes syphilis gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, moniliasis, nongonococcal urethritis, and infection with Chlamydia and Herpes virus.
They are the only contraceptives to protect against HIV and against sexually transmitted hepatitis B Virus.
Condoms reduce the chances of developing cervical dysplasia and cancer cervix (by preventing HPV infection)

Disadvantages

It can lead to contact dermatitis in female partners.

Presentation of JIA occurs as either polyarthritis (five or more joints, systemic symptoms not so severe or persistent), pauciarticular (four or fewer joints, lower-extremity joints, extra-articular disease unusual), or systemic disease (severe constitutional disease, systemic symptoms prior to arthritis, rheumatoid rash, high spiking fevers, variable joint involvement, also known as Still's disease). This disorder can be associated with spiking high fevers and diffuse rash, which are not a feature of rheumatic fever, toxic synovitis, or osteoarthritis. Although septic arthritis can affect any joint, it would not be likely to affect finger joints by causing spindle-shaped swellings.

Symptoms develop within the first 2 months of life. In symptomatic infants, the most common physical finding, reported in almost 100% of cases, is hepatomegaly; biochemical evidence of liver dysfunction is usually observed.* The other common findings are skeletal abnormalities, rash, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Radiographic abnormalities, periostitis or osteitis, involve multiple bones and are seen in the vast majority of symptomatic infants, but they also can be found in a fifth of infants with no symptoms or relevant findings on physical examination. Sometimes, the lesion is painful and an infant will favor an extremity (pseudopalsy).* The rash is maculopapular and may involve palms and soles. In contrast to acquired syphilis, a vesicular rash and bullae may develop. These lesions are also highly contagious.* Mucosal involvement may present as rhinitis ('snuffles'). Nasal secretions are highly contagious.* Hematological abnormalities include anemia and thrombocytopenia. Some infants have leukocytosis. Abnormal CSF examination is seen in a half of symptomatic infants but also can be found in 10% of those who are asymptomatic.* Late-onset congenital syphilis (diagnosed >2 y)* Scarring from the early systemic disease causes late manifestations of congenital syphilis.

Prelabour pains are mediated through,Tit-T12,T2-L3,S1-S3,L3-L4,"T11-T12 Pain pathways during labour The pain of labour arises from - Contraction of myometrium, against the resistance of cervix and perineum - Progressive dilatation of the cervix and lower uterine segment - Stretching and compression of pelvic and perineal structures Pain during the, first stage of labour is mostly visceral pain resulting from uterine contractions and cervical dilatation. It is usually confined to the T11-T12 dermatomes during the latent phase but eventually involves the TIO-LI dermatomes as the labour enters the the active phase. The visceral afferent fibres responsible for labour pain travel with sympathetic nerve.fibres.first to the uterine and cervical plexes then through the hypogastric and aoic plexes before entering the spinal cord with the T10-L1 nerve roots. The onset of perineal pain at the end of fist stage signals the beginning of the fetal descent and the second stage of labour.

Patient is also having shock, so she requires treatment of shock and intussusception.

Diagnosis of intussusception 

The clinical history and physical findings are usually sufficiently typical for diagnosis. Plain abdominal radiographs may show a density in the area of the intussusception. A barium enema shows a filling defect or cupping in the head of barium where its advance is obstructed by the intussusceptum. A central linear column of barium may be visible in the compressed lumen of the intussusceptum, and a thin rim of barium may be seen traped around the invaginating intestine in the folds of mucosa within the intussuscipiens (coiled-spring sign), especially after evacuation.
Retrogression of the intussusceptum under the pressure of the enema and gaseous distention of the small intestine from obstruction are also useful radiographic signs.
Ileoileal intussusuception is usually not demonstrable by barium enema but is suspected because of gaseous disten­tion of the intestine above the lesion. The use of 'air' enemas in the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception has supplanted hydrostatic reduction. Reflux of air into the terminal ileum and the disappearance of the mass at the ileocecal valve document successful reduction. Air reduction is associated with fewer complications and lower radia­tion exposure than traditional hydrostatic techniques.
Ultrasonography is a sensitive diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of intussusception.

Treatment of Intussusception 

The child should be first stabilized. A tube should be passed into the stomach through nose (nasogastric tube). An intravenous line should be placed and fluids should be given to prevent dehydration.
Reduction of an acute intussusception is an emergency procedure and performed immediately after diagnosis in preparation for possible surgery. The reduction can be achieved by installation of barium, saline or air.

'In patients with prolonged intussusception with signs of shock, peritoneal irritation, intestinal perforation or pneumatosis intestinal, reduction (with barium, saline or air) should not be attempted'.

In the above cases and in cases where reduction by barium/saline/air fails, surgery is required, i.e., manual operative reduction.
If the manual operative reduction is not possible or the bowel is not viable, resection of the intussusception is necessary, with an end to end anastomosis.
Treatment of shock (e.g. O2 IV fluid etc) should be given first if it is present.

About option a & b

As the patient is in shock, reduction by air or barium is contraindicated. However, a barium enema can be used as a diagnostic modality.",D

Complete blood counts along with platelet count are done in case of recurrent pregnancy loss. VDRL-To test for syphilis Rubella-virus screening are not done because as discussed earlier, infections rarely lead to recurrent Toxoplasma serology pregnancy loss. 'Few infection are firmly associated with early pregnancy loss- moreover, if any of these infections are associated with miscarriage, they are even less likely to cause recurrent miscarriage because maternal antibodies usually develop with primary infection. Thus, there appears no concrete indication to screen for infection in asymptomatic women with recurrent miscarriage' 'Routine serological lests, cervical cultures and endometrial biopsy to detect genital infections in women with recurrent pregnancy loss cannot be justified. Evaluation should be limited to women with clinical cervicits, chronic or recurrent bacterial vaginosis or other symptoms of pelvic infections' As far as Blood glucose testing is concerned- Neither Novaks, Leon speroff, nor Williams- say that blood glucose levels should be tested in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss - Leon speroff says?

The treatment for a case of virilizing adrenal hyperplasia is :,Estrogens,Antiandrogens,ACTH,None of these,"Coisone In a case of virilising adrenal hyperplasia there is a block in the biosynthesis of coicosteroids which leads to increased ACTH. which inturn leads to increased androgen and therefore virilisation. This defect can be corrected by administering coisone ,hydrocoisone or synthetic coicosteroids (like prednisone or prednisolone) which will effectively control the excess production of ACTH. It is most satisfactory to begin treatment with relatively larger doses of hydrocoisone divided in three doses orally for 7-10 days to obtain rapid suppression of adrenal activity. In younger infants the initial dose is about 25mg/day, and in adults 100mg/day. In newborn with CAH with defect in electrolyte regulation, it is usually necessary to administer NaCI in amounts of 4-6gm/day either orally or parenterally in addition to coisone.

Primary (Spasmodic) There is no identifiable pelvic pathology Spasmodic dysmenorrhea manifests as cramping pain most pronounced on the first and second day of menstruation. It rarely lasts for more than 12 hoursdeg Pain is felt mainly in the hypogastriumdeg and is referred to inner and front of thigh (it never extends below the level of knee and back of leg). Area supplied by iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves (T12, Ll and L2) are affected. Mainly seen in girls between 18 - 24 yearsdeg and begins to decline beyond 30 yrs. of age It is nearly always cured by pregnancy Secondary (Congestive) Pain occurring in presence of pelvic pathology Congestive dysmenorrhea manifests as diffuse dullache in the pelvis, accompanied by backache. It is thought to be the result of increasing tension in the pelvic tissue associated with inflammation exacerbated by premenstrual engorgement. The pain is at its height during the 2 or 3 days proceeding menstruation and slowly relieved as congestion is reduced with the onset of menstruation. Causes : - Uterine or vaginal anomalies with obstruction of menstrual flow - imperforate hymendeg - transverse vaginal septumdeg - Congenital malformations - bicornuate uterusdeg - sepatate uterusdeg - Asherman's syndromedeg Endometrial polypdeg - Uterine fibroicf2 - IUCDdeg - Chronic PIOdeg - Pelvic congestion syndromedeg - Broad ligament varicocoeledeg - Endometriosisdeg Adenomyosisdeg In the question cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in a young female is asked - Adenomyosis is observed frequently in elderly woman (ruling out Options 'b') - Fibroid are seen in approximately 20% of women over 20 years of age.

"A 19-year-old female comes to the physician because of left lower quadrant pain for 2 months. She states that she first noticed the pain 2 months ago but now it seems to be growing worse. She has had no changes in bowel or bladder function. She has no fevers or chills and no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The pain is intermittent and sometimes feels like a dull pressure. Pelvic examination is significant for a left adnexal mass that is mildly tender. Urine hCG is negative. Pelvic ultrasound shows a 6 cm complex left adnexal mass with features consistent with a benign cystic teratoma. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",Repeat pelvic examination in 1 year,Repeat pelvic ultrasound in 6 weeks,Prescribe the oral contraceptive pill,Perform Laparotomy,"This patient has a presentation and findings that are most consistent with a benign cystic teratoma. Dermoids are a type of ovarian germ cell tumor. Germ cell tumors are the most common type of ovarian neoplasm in females under the age of 20 and dermoids are the most common benign ovarian neoplasm.Dermoids can range in size from small masses that are noted ncidentally on ultrasound and cause no symptoms, to large cysts that cause pain and pressure, as this patient has. Laparotomy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient because, as adnexal masses enlarge--especially when they become greater than 5 cm--the risk of ovarian torsion increases. Thus, laparotomy withremoval of the dermoid is indicated to prevent torsion. Also, this patient's mass is causing her symptoms of pain and pressure and, on that basis, should be removeD. Finally, while the mass most likely is a dermoid, this is not ceain without pathologic diagnosis and, therefore, the cyst should be removed and evaluated by a pathologist. At the time of surgery, close examination should be made of the other ovary because dermoids may be found bilaterally in more than 10% of cases. To repeat pelvic examination in 1 year (Choice A)would not be correct management. This patient is symptomatic with a 6 cm ovarian mass that is at risk for torsion. She should, therefore, be managed surgically. To repeat pelvic ultrasound in 6 weekschoice B. is appropriate for some adnexal masses. For example, in a young woman with a small complex cyst that appears consistent with a corpus luteum, it may be most prudent to recheck an ultrasound in 6 weeks to see if the cyst has resolveD. This patient, however, is symptomatic with a 6 cm cyst that appears to be adermoid, which will not resolve spontaneously. She, therefore, requires surgery. To prescribe the oral contraceptive pill (Choice C) may help to prevent future ovarian cysts but it will not resolve this cyst, which requires surgical management.",D

• The infection to uterus descends from the tube, i.e. if TB endometritis is present, invariably tubes are involved.
• Most common symptom of Genital TB: Infertility (35 – 60%). Infertility is either due to blockage of fallopian tube or due to loss of tubal function even if tubes are patent.
Tubercular endometritis causes uterine scarring which destroys the endometrium leading to synechia formation (Asherman syndrome) and infertility.

Causes of prolonged first stage of labor are all except: March 2009,Weak uterine contractions,CPD,Rigid perineum,Transverse presentation,"Ans. C: Rigid Perineum The first stage stas with uterine contractions leading to complete cervical dilation and is divided into latent and active phases. In the latent phase, irregular uterine contractions occur with slow and gradual cervical effacement and dilation. The active phase is demonstrated by an increased rate of cervical dilation and fetal descent. The active phase usually stas at 3-4 cm cervical dilation and is subdivided into the acceleration, maximum slope, and deceleration phases. The second stage of labor is defined as complete dilation of the cervix to the delivery of the infant. The third stage of labor involves delivery of the placenta. Prolonged first stage of labour Latent phase: Diagnosis of abnormal labor during the latent phase is uncommon and likely an incorrect diagnosis. Active phase: Around the time uterine contractions cause the cervix to become 3-4 cm dilated, the patient usually enters the active phase of the first stage of labor. There may be abnormalities of cervical dilation (protracted dilation and arrest of dilation) or descent abnormalities (protracted descent and arrest of descent).

C. Better in multiple gestationThe ultrasound nuchal translucency (NT) is now appreciated as a sensitive marker for Down syndrome and other aneuploidies between 10 and 13 weeks. Outside that range, the NT disappears. Although some centers have had superb results, others have not done well. Blood free -hCG and PAPP-A in the first trimester, and double (AFP and hCG) or triple (AFP, hCG, and estriol at 15 to 20 weeks) evaluations are statistically comparable. The combination of NT and first-trimester biochemistry will likely be the optimal approach. Biochemistry does not work well for multiple gestations. Ultrasound can also detect structural anomalies, but often high-quality ultrasound services require patients to travel long distances, whereas blood can be shipped from essentially anywhere to a competent lab.",C

What is the most likely cause for beaded appearance of fallopian tubes with clubbed ends of fimbriae on HSG?,Genital tuberculosis,Chlamydia,Neisseria gonorrhoea,Endometriosis,"Ans. a. Genital tuberculosis (Ref: Shaw's 16/e p111)Most likely cause for beaded appearance of fallopian tubes with clubbed ends of fimbriae on HSG is genital Tuberculosis.' Tubal occlusion in tuberculosis is considered the most common sign observed on an HSG and occurs most commonly in the region of isthmus and ampulla. Multiple constrictions along the course offallopian tube can also form from scarring and give rise to 'beaded' appearance to the tubes. Scarring can also lead to a 'rigid pipe stem' appearance of the tubes.'Hysterosalpingographic presentation of tubal TB vary from non-specific changes such as hydrosalpinx to specific- pattern such as 'beaded tube', 'golf club tube, 'pipestem tube', 'cobble stone tube' and the 'leopard skin tube'.Genital TuberculosisGenital tuberculosis is almost always a secondary infectionQMC primary sites: Lungs >Lymph nodes >AbdomenQMC Route of spread: HematogenousQSites of Genital TB% InvolvementTubes90-100%QUterus50-60%QOvaries20-30%QVagina & Vulva1-2%QPathology :MC site: Bilateral fallopian tubesQIn Fallopian tubes: MC affected part: Ampulla; MC encountered pathology is endosalpingitisQ2nd MC site of involvement: UterusQCornu of the uterus is MC affected as it is in continuation with the fallopian tube & infection descends from the tubesQClinical Features:MC age group: 20-30 years (28 years specifically)MC symptom: InfertilityQUterine TB can manifest in the form of:Ashermairs syndrome (destruction of the endometrial lining of uterine cavity with the formation of intrauterine synechiae or adhesions)QPyometra (pus-filled uterine cavity)If patient conceives spontaneously, ectopic pregnancy is the most likely outcome.Menstrual abnormalities: Hypomenorrhea or amenorrhea due to Asherman's syndrome & polymenorrhea menorrhagiaQDiagnosis:Hysterosalpingography in TBHSG is contraindicated in patients of genital TB as it can lead to reactivation or spreading of diseaseQ.If unknowingly HSG is done in patients of TB, characteristic findings are* Lead pipe appearance of tubeQ* Beaded appearance of tubeQ* HydrosalpinxQ* Corneal blockQ* Intravasation of dyeQ* Golf club tubeQ* Tobacco pouch appearance of the fimbrial end of tube Q* Uterus: Honeycomb appearance due toAsherman syndromeQEndometrial biopsy: Best time is 1-2 days before or 12 hours after onset of menses.

"Preterm baby with PDA, which is the least likely findings?",CO2 washout,Bounding pulses,Pulmonary hemorrhage,Necrotising enterocolitis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., CO2 washout PDA in preterm neonate o In previous explanations I have explained that chances of spontaneous closure of PDA are higher in premature infants as there is no structural abnormality. However, you should keep in mind that this fact is true when we are comparing the spontaneous closure of PDA between term and pre-term neonate. Overall, the percentage of spontaneous closure of PDA in preterm neonate is very low. To avoid confusion, I am explaining following facts in brief:? 1) Normal neonate :- Ductus aeriosus closes functionally within about 15 hours of bih. 2) PDA in term (mature) neonate :- The persistence of ductus aeriosus beyond 24 hours after bih is considered as PDA in term neonate. Spontaneous closure of PDA does not usually occur because PDA results from structural abnormality. 3) PDA in pre-term (pre-mature) neonate :- The ductus aeriosus in pre-term neonate is not as responsive to increased oxygen content as it is in term neonate. However, there is no structural abnormality. i) Chances of spontaneous closure are very less (compared to normal term neonate). ii)Chances of spontaneous closure are more than the term-neonate with PDA. However, in premature neonate, where hypoxic pulmonary disease is commonplace, the ductus being sensitive to hypoxia, remains open. o So, it is very unlikely that spontaneous closure of PDA will occur in pre-term neonate. But chances are more when compared to term neonate with PDA (not normal term neonate in which ductus aeriosus closes within 15 hours of bih). Manifestations of PDA in pre-term neonate 1) Apnea for unexplained reasons in an infant recovering from RDS; 2) A hyperdynamic precordium, bounding peripheral pulses, wide pulse pressure, and a continuous or systolic murmur with or without extension into diastole or an apical diastolic murmur, multiple clicks resembling the shaking of dice; 3) Carbon dioxide retention; 4) Increasing oxygen dependence; 5) X-ray evidence of cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings; and 6) Hepatomegaly o Increased pulmonary blood flow and compromised ventricular function accompanying dropping pulmonary resistance in the setting of a PDA is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hemorrhage. o The greatest risk factor for NEC is prematurity. Any etiology which leads on to hemodynamic or hypoxic insult predisposes to NEC. PDA is common in preterm infants and it definitely causes hemodynamic stress and is a risk factor for development of NEC.",A

Acyanotic congenital heart diseases 

Acyanotic heart disease may be of two types : -


Left to right shunts. (ASD, VSD, PDA)
Obstructive lesions (PS, AS, Coarctation of aorta).

A) Left to right shunts
Patients with a left to right shunts have following features: -

Frequent respiratory tract infection → Because pulmonary circulation is overloaded which may result in pulmonary edema, CHF and infection.
No cyanosis → Most of the blood is in pulmonary circulation. So there is no impairment in oxygenation of blood.
Pericardial bulge -4 Frequent chest infections with tachypnea causes the soft rib cage being drawn inward at the diaphragmetic attachments of the ribs. This combined with cardioamegaly gives them a precordial buldge.
Hyperkinetic precordium
Delayed diastolic murmur in tricuspid or mitral area → Due to increased flow through these areas depending on the type of CHDs.
Cardiomegaly with plethoric pulmonary vasculature on chest X-ray → Due to increased flow through pulmonary circulation (plethoric lung) there is increased volume overload to left side of heart → Cardiomegaly.

B) Obstructive Lesions

Obstructive congenital diseases have following features.


Absence offrequent chest infection → Pulmonary circulation is not overloaded.
The absence of cyanosis → No defect in pulmonary oxygenation and there is no shunt where arterial and venous blood can mix.
The absence of precordial buldge → There is no chest infection or Cardiomegaly.
Heaving (forcible) cardiac impulse → Obstructive lesions cause concentric hypertrophy of ventricles that produce forcible contraction.
Systolic thrill due to systolic ejection murmur → When hypertrophied ventricles forcibly pump the blood through stenotic pulmonary or aortic valve, systolic thrill and systolic ejection murmur are produced.
Absence of delayed diastolic murmur in mitral or tricuspid area → Blood flow through these area is not increased.
Presence of delayed corresponding second sound (A2 in AS and P2 in PS) → Because prolonged flow through these area results in delayed closure of that valve.
Normal sized heart and pulmonary vasculature in chest x-ray → There is concentric hypertrophy, i.e., hypertrophy without dilatation. So, heart size is normal on x-ray.",B

"After first meiotic division, the primary oocyte remains arrested in ?",Diplotene stage,Pachytene stage,Metaphase,Telophase,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Diplotene stage Oogenesis refers to the process of formation of ova from the primitive germ cells. Unlike fetal testis (in which spermatogenesis beings at pubey), the fetal ovary begins oogenesis by 10 weeks of gestation. The sequence of events in oogenesis are : The primitive germ cells undergo mitotic divisions to form oogonia (diploid cells). Oogonium is unique in that it is the only female cell in which both X' chromosomes are active. The oogonia proliferate by mitosis to form primary oocytes (diploid cells). Primary oocytes formed from the oogonia enter a prolonged prophase (diplotene stage) of the first meiotic division and remain in this stage until ovulation occurs after pubey. Primary oocytes completes the first meiotic division at pubey just before ovulation to form secondary oocyte (haploid cell) and 1st polor body. Secondary oocyte immediately begins second meiotic division but this division stops at metaphase and is completed only if the mature ovum (ootid) is feilized with sperm. At that time second polor body (polocyte) is extruded and the feilized ovum proceeds to form a new individual. Feilization normally occurs in the ampulla of fallopian tube.",A

Anatomical closure of ductus arteriosus occurs at –,Birth,3–4 day,10th day,30th day,"Circulatory adjustments at birth 

These are brought about because of a shift from placental dependance for gas exchange in the fetus to pulmonary gas exchange in the neonate.

1) Pulmonary circulation

Immediately after birth lungs expand due to the first few breaths of the neonate.
This causes a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (O2 causes pulmonary vasodilatation).
This results in increased flow into pulmonary trunk and arteries.
The pulmonary artery pressure falls due to lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance.
The pressure relations between the aorta and pulmonary trunk are reversed so that the blood flow through the ductus arteriosus is reversed → Instead of blood flowing from the pulmonary artery to aorta, the direction of flow through ductus, is from the aorta to pulmonary trunk.
Increasing oxygen saturation causes the muscle of ductus to constrict →

In full term neonates, the ductus  arteriosus closes within 10 to 25 days.
2) System circulation and circulation through the heart

Loss of placental circulation and clamping of the cord after birth results in an increase in systemic vascular resistance.
This tends to increase the aortic blood pressure and the left ventricular systolic pressure.
The loss of placental circulation results in a sudden reduction of flow through ductus venosus which closes off  → Flow through ductus venosus disappears by the 7th day of postnatal life.
The loss of placental flow results in a decrease in the volume of blood returning to right atrium → Right atrial pressure decreases.
The left atrial pressure becomes higher than right atrial pressure and the septum primum which ats as a valve of fossa ovalis, approximates with the septum secundum to close off formen ovale.
Functional closure of foramen ovale occurs very quickly.
Over a period of months, the septum primtun and septum secundum become firmly adherent resulting in anatomical closure of the foramen ovale.
After closure of ductus arteriosus, there is establishment of postnatal circulation : -
The blood reaching the right atrium through IVC and SVC is emptied into the right ventricle from where it is pumped into pulmonary trunk.
After coursing through lungs for gas exchange, it reaches the left atrium and ventricle.
The left ventricle pumps it out for distribution in the body for oxygenation of the tissues.
The venous return again comes back to right atrium through IVC and SVC.
All of the blood leaving the right ventricle, after coursing through lungs, reaches the left ventricle → The two ventricles are connected in series and therefore, the output of right and left ventricles are same (in contrast to fetal circulation, where right ventricular output is more).",C

Conceptus enters uterine cavity in which cell stage ?,4 cells,8 cells,16 cells,32 cells,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 16 cells Feilization and implantation Feilization refers to fusion of male and female gametes (i.e. spermatozoon and ovum). It takes place in the middle segment (ampulla) of fallopian tube. Before feilization, the ovum and sperms reach the ampulla for feilization. Fusion of spermatocyte and ovum leads to formation of zygote. First week of development begins immediately after feilization and includes :? i) Cleavage of zygote : Zygote (feilized ovum) stas dividing immediately and large zygote is subdivided into smaller daughter cells called blastomeres. Blastomeres are still surrounded by zona pellucida. Cleavage occurs in fallopian tube (uterine tube). ii) Formation of morula : At about 16 cells stage the blastomeres tightly align by the process of compaction to form a compact ball of cells called morula (mulberry). This process of compaction leads to segregation of cells into two groups (i) inner cells (inner cell mass), and (ii) outer cells (outer cell mass). Morula enters uterine cavity 4 days after feilization. iii) Formation of blastocyst : As the morula enters the uterine cavity, uterine fluid diffuses through zona pellucida and fills small intercellular gaps between blastomeres, and morula is conveed to blastocyst. Blastocyst consists of :? a) Zona pellucida : Outer covering. b) Embryoblast : A group of centerally located cells of inner cell mass and later give rise to tissues of embryo proper. c) Trophoblast : A thin outer layer of cells formed from outer cells mass and later give rise extraembryonic tissues. d) Blastocele : Cavity of blastocyst : The region of blastocyst containing embryoblast is known as embryonic pole and the opposite pole, the abembryonic pole. The trophoblasts overlying the embryoblast at embryonic pole is called polar trophoblast and that occupying the rest of wall called mural trophoblast. Between 5-6 days after feilization, blastocyst hatches from zona pellucida, and this naked blastocyst is ready for implantation",C

Which of the following are true for Bronchiolitis in children?,"Commonly seen in children between 1- 6 months of age, but can be seen upto 2 years",RSV is the most common causative organism,Disease usually occurs in winter and spring season.,All of the above,"Ans. D. All of the aboveBronchiolitis primarily affects young infants (1- 6 months some may be affected upto 2 years of age), clinical manifestations are initially subtle. Infants may become increasingly fussy and have difficulty feeding during the 2 to 5-day incubation period. A low-grade fever, usually less than 101.5degF, and increasing coryza and congestion usually follow the incubation period. In older children and adults, as well as in up to 60% of infants, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is generally confined to the upper airway and does not progress further. Over a period of 2-5 days, RSV infection progresses from the upper to the lower respiratory tract, and this progression leads to the development of cough, dyspnea, wheezing, and feeding difficulties.",D

The following are related to face presentation except:,The commonest position is LMA,Engaging diameter is submentobregmatic,The diameter distending the vulval outlet is mentovertical,"During moulding, there is elongation of occipitofrontal diameter","Face presentation:

The attitude of the fetus shows complete flexion of the limbs with extension of the spine. There is complete extension of the head so that the occiput is in contact with the back.
The denominator is mentum.
The commonest position is left mentoanterior (LMA).
Face presentation present during pregnancy (primary) is rare, while that developing after the onset of labor (secondary) is common. It occurs more frequently seen in multiparae (70%), like other malpresentations.
Most common maternal cause is platypelloid pelvis and most common fetal cause is anencephaly.
The diameter of engagement is the oblique diameter—right in LMA, left in RMA.
The engaging diameter of the head is submento-bregmatic 9.5 cm (3 3/4”) in fully extended head or submentovertical  11.5 cm (4 1/2”) in partially extended head.
Engagement is delayed because of long distance between the mentum and biparietal plane (7 cm).
The head is born by flexion: (11.5 cm).
Vaginal delivery is possible in nentoanterior positions but not in persistent mentoposterior.
In mentoposterior during early stages of labor the policy of wait and watch should be adopted, in hope of mentoposterior getting converted to mentoanterior spontanelously. Persistent mentoposterior position is an indication for doing cesarean section.",C
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a disease of –,Neuromuscular junction,Sarcolemmal proteins,Muscle contractile proteins,Disuse atrophy due to muscle weakness,"DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (PSEUDO HYPERTROPHIC MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY)

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common hereditary neuromuscular disease affecting all races and ethnic groups.
Inheritance: X linked recessive
Presentation occurs between ages 3 and 5 


Pathogenesis

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for producing dystrophin.
Dystrophin is `subsarcolemmal protein' localized to the inner surface of the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre.
Dystrophin is part of Dystrophin - Glycoprotein sarcolenzmal complex and this protein deficiency leads to secondary loss of sarcoglycans and dystroglycans resulting in weakness of sarcolemma, causing membrane tears and muscle fibre necrosis.

Clinical manifestations:

Gower's sign is positive
Pseudohypertrophy of the calf is seen (muscle is replaced by fat & connective tissue)
Loss of muscle strength is progressive.
Proximal muscles and neck flexors are involved more
Leg involvement is more severe than arm involvement.
Contractures of heel cords and iliotibial band occurs (by age of 6 years)
progressive scoliosis develops.

Complications:

Chest deformity (scoliosis): Impairs pulmonary function By age of 16 and 18 years patients are predisposed to serious pulmonary fatal infections.

The vein of Markowski actually drains into the vein of Galen.VGAM typically result in high-output congestive heart failure or may present with developmental delay, hydrocephalus, and seizures.The vein of Galen abnormality is the MOST COMMON arteriovenous malformation in neonates.Signs and symptomsIt commonly presents in the neonatal period, although it may present later, in early childhood.Typically, in the neonatal period. VGAM presents with congestive heart failure, a cranial bruit, hydrocephaly, subarachnoid hemorrhage and marked carotid pulses.The heart failure is due to the size of the arteriovenous shunt that can steal 80% or more of the cardiac output, w ith large volumes of blood under high pressure returning to the right heart and pulmonary circulation and sinus venosus atrial septal defects.CCF is also the most common cause of death in VGAM.Neonates may present with tachypnea, respiratory distress, and cyanosis.They often require ventilatory support and institution of aggressive management of heart failure.Hydrocephalus may be the presenting feature in older infants ('sunseting sign' in the eye).Developmental delay: Signs of hydrocephalus and congestive heart failure should be looked for in infants with developmental delay.In early childhood, symptoms include headache, convulsive seizures, hydrocephalus, and cardiac failure.TreatmentNeurosurgical procedures to relieve hydrocephalus (A ventriculoperitoneal shunt)Open surgery has a high morbidity and mortality.Recent advances over the past few decades have made endovascular embolization the preferred method of treatment.Another treatment option is Radiotherapy.

A 26-year old primigravida with severe rheumatic heart disease (mitral stenosis with mitral regurgitation) is in early labour. The obstetrician wants to try a normal labour. Which of the following is the ideal intervention for labour analgesia?,Parenteral opioids,Neuraxial analgesia,Inhalational analgesia,Spinal anaesthesia,"Ans. is Neuraxial analgesia Pain and anxiety during labour and delivery provoke catecholamine surge resulting in tachycardia, hypertension increased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance.This may prove to be catastrophic for patients with heart disease who may develop ischemia or heart failure.* This can be prevented by providing adequate labour analgesia.Earlier spinal neuraxial blockade was used for this purpose.It was believed that sympathetic neuraxial blockade will provide adequate analgesia. However, sympathetic blockade caused by standard neuraxial techniques can produce dramatic cardiovascular changes with decrease in cardiac output secondary to a reduction in preload following sympathetic blockade.Standard spinal blockade is considered a cardiovascular risk due to the sympathetic blockade that decreases cardiac preload by causing arteriolar dilatation. Arteriolar dilatation will reduce systemic vascular resistance and may cause reflex tachycardia.Standard spinal block may produce following changes: -Low systemic vascular resistance can reverse the pressure gradient across a left to right intracardiac shunt, leading to catastrophic decrease in pulmonary blood flow.These changes are usually more severe with a single shot spinal anaesthesia compared with central neuraxial blockade. However, in the last few years, neuraxial blockade has benefitted from important technical and pharmacological improvements that allow it to be tailored to the patients' needs and obstetric course.Safe neuraxial techniques avoid standard techniques with fixed doses and instead should tailor the anaesthetic to the patient.Single shot spinal anaesthesia is not recommended for the cardiac pregnant patient, in contrast a well-controlled epidural or spinal anaesthesia is beneficial even for the most severe cardiac disease.If a rapid decrease in preload and afterload are likely to compromise cardiac status then local anaesthetic is eliminated from the intrathecal portion of the spinal epidural (CSE) and only intrathecal opioid is administered.In these patients the epidural should be dosed slowly with local anaesthetic to maintain stable hemodynamics and adequate uteroplacental blood flow.The technique carries the risk of potential delay in the discovery of poorly placed epidural catheter after a combined spinal epidural (CSE): however, epidural catheters placed during a CSE are less likely to fail.If neuraxial analgesia is not an option for a high-risk cardiac patient, then the advisability of vaginal delivery may need to be considered.Although patient controlled analgesia (PCA) via intravascular opioid infusion with remifantil or fentanyl is performed in many patients, this may not be good alternative for the cardiac patient.Pain control is typically suboptimal leading to increased catecholamine release. Furthermore to achieve, even moderately effective analgesia, the dose of opioid required could suppress ventilation. The resultant carbon di-oxide retention can cause respiratory acidosis, further catecholamine release and increase pulmonary hypertension leading to arrhythmias, ischemia, or heart, failure.Mitral stenosisThe main goal of anaesthetic technique is to avoid 'tachycardia' as the time required for left ventricular diastolic filling is prolonged.Segmental epidural anaesthesia is recommended early during labour, avoiding significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance with reflex tachycardia.Cesarean section is also managed with segmental epidural anaesthesia.Phenylephrine is the vasopressor of choice.Patients with prominent symptoms are at significant risk in peripartum period and should receive peripheral and pulmonary artery catheter monitoring continued for a minimum of 24 hour after delivery since tolerance to postpartum fluid shifts may be poor.Mitral regurgitationMitral insufficiency as well as mitral value prolapsed are well tolerated by the pregnant patient since a decrease in SVR will reduce the regurgitant flow.Atrial arrhythmias and risk of embolism from atrial thrombi are important complications.Pain will automatically increase systemic vascular resistance and adequate labour analgesia should minimize peripheral vasoconstriction and thus avoid an increase in left ventricular after load associated with labour pain.Additional sympathetic blockade further decreases systemic vascular resistance.Neuraxial techniques are indicated for labour, vaginal delivery and cesarean section.",B

The pa of the internal lining of the uterus which is not shed during menstruation is the?,Endometrium,Myometrium,Mesometrium,Cervical mucosa,"This question is phrased in a slightly tricky way, so it's impoant to break it down before looking at the answers. There are two things to think about here First, you need to decide if a structure is pa of the uterus. If it is pa of the uterus, then you need to decide if it is shed during menstruation. The correct answer will be a structure that is pa of the uterus but is not shed during menstruation. Answers about structures that are not shed during menstruation because they are not pa of the uterine wall are incorrect. The myometrium is our correct answer. It is the middle muscular component of the uterine wall and it is not shed during menstruation. The endometrium is the inner mucosal coat of the uterus. It is shed during menstruation and exhibits many characteristic changes during the menstrual cycle. The mesometrium is the mesentary of the uterus which forms the major pa of the broad ligament of the uterus. It is not even pa of the internal lining of the uterus, so it's not the answer to look for. Cervical mucosa lines the cervix, which is the inferior poion of the uterus. This mucosa is shed during menstruation. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 6. Paurition. In F.G. Cunningham, K.J. Leveno, S.L.

True regarding rubella infection in pregnancy is: March 2010,Risk of congenital infection is more in last trimester,Vaccination is indicated in pregnancy for protection,IgM antibodies in fetus reflects immunity,It is caused by DNA virus,"Ans. C: IgM antibodies in fetus reflects immunity Fetal rubella syndrome is a congenital disorder resulting from primary maternal infection with the rubella virus. It is characterized mainly by deafness, mental retardation, congenital cataract, hea defects, and other structural anomalies that may be found with variable severity and frequency. During acute rubella in pregnancy, the rate of congenital infection is over 90% in the 12 first weeks of pregnancy, approximately 60% in weeks 13 to 17, 25% in weeks 18 to 24 and then increases again during the last month of pregnancy. Etiology: It is caused by a RNA togavirus, which is the only member of the genus Rubivirus. The fetus is infected by transplacental transmission. Administration of rubella vaccine has significantly reduced the incidence of maternal infection, although reinfection after vaccination is possible. The development of fetal infection reaches 50% among those exposed during the first trimester and 20% during the second trimester. Diagnosis: The most frequent sonographic findings are cardiac malformations (in paicular, septal defects), eye defects (cataracts, microphthalmia, and retinopathy), microcephaly, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and growth restriction. Deafness and mental retardation are expected after bih. Test for rubella specific antibody (IgM) should be done within 10 days of the exposure to know whether patient is immune or not. Associated anomalies: Occasionally the following anomalies can be associated with the classic findings of fetal rubella syndrome: renal disorders, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, meningocele, glaucoma, patent ductus aeriosus, and peripheral pulmonary stenosis. Differential diagnosis: All the conditions that can be associated with congenital hepatomegaly and/or cataract should be excluded. It includes congenital infections (TORCHS), fetal anemia, fetal liver tumor, chondrodysplasia punctata, NeuLaxova syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, and Walker-Warburg syndrome. Prognosis: Intrauterine death may occur. Postnatal impact of the intrauterine infection varies from absence of any defect to all the anomalies mentioned above with variable severity. The agent may remain for years in the tissues, causing chronic infection and its complications (such as diabetes mellitus due to chronic viropathy of the pancreas). Management: Termination of pregnancy should be considered every time fetal infection is detected during the first trimester, due to the severity of the condition in this group. After bility, monthly sonographic monitoring for growth and follow-up of the anomalies is recommended. Prevention: Women found to be susceptible during pregnancy should be offered vaccination postpaum and before discharge from the hospital (vaccine is not recommended in pregnancy). Breastfeeding is not a contraindication to receiving the rubella vaccine.",C

Emergency contraceptives are effective if administered within following period after unprotected intercourse :,24 hours,48 hours,72 hours,120 hours,"Ans. is d i.e. 120 hours The standard recommendation is to sta emergency contraceptive not later than 72 hours. The greatest protection is offered if it is taken within 12 hours, as postponing the dose by 12 hours raises the chances of pregnancy by almost 50% For this reason, the treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after sexual exposure. Note : But here the question says - till how / long are ECs effective or till how long can they be adminsitered. 'The tables can be offered upto 120 hours, but its efficacy decreases with the longer coital - drug interval.' According to current concepts in contraceptions and women health also -Emergency contraception can be given upto 5 days. This is becasue 'Emergency contraception is not an aboifacient i.e. it will not act after implantation has occured. This is also the basis for the window period of 5 days for use effectiveness of EC ,as the whole proocess from deposition of sperms to implantation takes about 5 days.'",D

Investigation of choice for diagnosis of vasa pre is:,APT test,Color doppler,MRI,HSG,"Vasa pre : Color Doppler is the investigation of choice. A transabdominal color Doppler sonography which show 'flow' in vessels overlying the internal cervical os. A Transvaginal ultrasound with color Doppler is even better method to demonstrate this. The APT test is a biochemical test done to differentiate maternal and fetal blood when a pregnant woman presents with a vaginal bleeding episode. Most vaginal bleeding in antepaum hemorrhage are due to abruption and Placenta pre. Placental abruption (32 percent), pre (21 percent), and cervical bleeding (6.6 percent) were the most frequent causes However, when these are not confirmed , then to suspect fetal bleeding due to Vasa Pre, an APT test is done. Here, the vaginal blood is mixed with NaOH, and if the hemoglobin gets denatured ( Colorless) then its maternal blood. A positive APT test would indicate that blood is of fetal origin. A negative test indicates that the blood is of maternal origin.",B

"An infant weighing 1600 g (3 1/2 lb) is born at 32 weeks' gestation. Initial evaluation was benign, and the infant was transferred to the level 2 nursery for prematurity. The nurse there calls at 1 hour of life and reports the infant is tachypneic. Vital signs include a heart rate of 140 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 80 breaths per minute, a temperature of 35degC (95degF), and a peripheral oxygen saturation of 98%. The lungs are clear with bilateral breath sounds and there is no murmur; the infant is in no distress. The child's chest radiograph is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluating the infant?",Obtain a complete blood count and differential.,Perform a lumbar puncture.,Administer intravenously 5cc of D50W.,Place the infant under a warmer.,"(d) Source: (Hay et al, pp 30-31. Kliegman et al, pp 536-537. McMillan et al, p 259. Rudolph et al, pp 171-172.) The radiograph is normal. However, the vignette describes a cold infant. A room temperature of 24degC (approximately 75degF) provides a cold environment for newborn infants. Aside from the fact that these infants emerge from a warm, 37.6degC (99.5degF) intrauterine environment, at birth, infants (and especially preterm infants) are wet, have a relatively large surface area for their weight, and have little subcutaneous fat. Within minutes of delivery, the infants are likely to become pale or blue and their body temperatures will drop. In order to bring body temperature back to normal, they must increase their metabolic rate; ventilation, in turn, must increase proportionally to ensure an adequate oxygen supply. Because a preterm infant is likely to have respiratory problems and be unable to oxygenate adequately, lactate can accumulate and lead to a metabolic acidosis. Infants rarely shiver in response to a need to increase heat production. If the tachypnea persists after warming the infant, sepsis, pneumonia, and primary surfactant deficiency are all possible; several of the alternative answers then may be appropriate.",D

Which among the following is the BEST parameter for estimation of fetal age by ultrasound in third trimester?,Femur length,Biparietal diameter,Abdominal circumference,Inter-ocular distance,"In the third trimester femur length is most accurate to estimate the gestational age. Gestational age in the first trimester is usually calculated by from fetal crown rump length. This is the longest demonstrable length of the embryo or fetus excluding the limbs and the yolk sac. Four fetal parameters routinely measured in the second and third trimester are BPD, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femoral length. In the second trimester, the best parameters for estimating gestational age are biparietal diameter and head circumference. When BPD is altered head circumference has the advantage of being shape independent and can be used as an alternative. Femoral length can also be used and is nearly as accurate as head measurements.

This zone of rarefaction (Trumerfeld zone), a linear break in the bone that is proximal and parallel to the white line, represents area of debris of broken-down bone trabeculae and connective tissue.A Pelkan spur is a lateral prolongation of the white line and may be present at cortical ends. Epiphyseal separation can occur along the line of destruction, with either linear displacement or compression of the epiphysis against the shaft.Subperiosteal hemorrhages are not visible using plain radiographs during the active phase of scurvy. However, during healing the elevated periosteum becomes calcified and radiopaque, giving a dumbbell or club shape to the affected bone.",A

Best prognosis of Neonatal Seizures is in ?,Myoclonic,Tonic clonic,Focal,Opsoclonus,"Focal seizures have the best prognosis when compared with other. Neonatal seizure classification Clonic seizures These movements most commonly are associated with electrographic seizures. They often involve 1 extremity or 1 side of the body. The rhythm of the clonic movements is usually slow, at 1-3 movements per second. Tonic seizures These may involve 1 extremity or the whole body. Focal tonic seizures involving 1 extremity often are associated with electrographic seizures. Generalized tonic seizures often manifest with tonic extension of the upper and lower limbs and also may involve the axial musculature in an opisthotonic fashion. Generalized tonic seizures mimic decoicate posturing; the majority are not associated with electrographic seizures. Myoclonic seizures These may occur focally in 1 extremity or in several body pas (in which case they are described as multifocal myoclonic seizures). Focal and multifocal myoclonic seizures typically are not associated with electrographic correlates. These movements are thought to be non-epileptic in nature and a reflection of severe encephalopathy. Prognosis Prognosis is determined by the etiology of the neonatal seizures. If the EEG background is normal, the prognosis is excellent for seizures to resolve; normal development is likely. Severe EEG background abnormalities indicate poor prognosis; such patients frequently have cerebral palsy and epilepsy. The presence of spikes on EEG is associated with a 30% risk of developing future epilepsy. The prognosis following neonatal seizures that result from isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage is excellent, with 90% of children not having residual neurologic deficits.

Puberty happens due to pulasatile release of -,GnRH,Estrogen,LH/ICSH,Testosterone,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., GnRH o Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction.o It is initiated by the release of GnRH hormone in pulseso On average, girls begin puberty around ages 10-11; boys around ages 11-12. Girls usually complete puberty around ages 15-17,while boys usually complete puberty around ages 16-17.o The major landmark of puberty for females is menarche, the onset of menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12-13;for males, it is the first ejaculation, which occurs on average at age 13",A
"An infant presents with hypotonia and hyporeflexia. During his intrauterine period, there was polyhydramnios and decreased fetal movements. Most probable diagnosis is –",Spinal muscular atrophy,Congenital myasthenia,Congenital myotonia,Muscular dystrophy,"Out of the given options only spinal muscular atrophy is able to cause hypotonia and hyporeflexia during infancy. Rest of them either present late in childhood or do not give the symptoms.
Polyhydramnios and decreased fetal movements can occur in any neuromuscular disorder which present during intrauterine life.
Lets see each option one by one.


Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)

SMA is a degenerative disease of motor neurons that begin in fetal life and continue to progress in infancy and childhood.
The cardinal features are:
Hypotonia
Generalized weakness
Absent tendon stretch reflexes
Involvement of tongue face and jaw muscle but sparing of extraocular muscle and sphincters.

Congenital myotonia

Congenital myotonia or myotonia congenita is a chloride channel defect of skeletal muscle.
There are weakness and generalized hypertrophy of muscles.
Its ruled out as


Presents in early childhood (2-3 years age)
Deep tendon reflexes are preserved.

Congenital myasthenia

It's a disease of neuromuscular junction similar to myasthenia gravis except that its not autoimmune but rather due to genetic mutations.
It presents in infancy and childhood with symptom similar to myasthenia gravis.
It can be ruled out as-


It does not present in the intrauterine life (so does not cause polyhydramnios).
DTRs are preserved

Muscular dystrophies

Muscular dystrophy refers to a group of hereditary progressive diseases.
It includes
Duchene's muscular dystrophy        
Limb-girdle      
Congenital myopathies
Becker  
Myotonic dystrophic
All of these except congenital myopathies are easily ruled out as they present in childhood age. some may rarely present in infancy but never in the intrauterine life.
Congenital myopathies are the most difficult one to rule out.


They present with hypotonia in infancy.
It may also present in intrauterine life.
The only reason I'm with 'Spinal muscular atrophy' is that congenital myopathy is a very rare disease.",A
The production of cervical mucus is predominantly stimulated by which of the following hormone?,Progesterone,Estradiol,Estriol,Pregnenolone,"Cervical mucus is a complex heterogenous secretion produced by the glands of the endocervix. Estrogen mainly estradiol (the most potent estrogen), stimulates cervical mucus production and as its levels rise during the follicular phase mucus become more abundant, watery and less cellular. Progesterone inhibits cervical mucus production and makes it opaque, viscid and impenetrable. Cervical mucus: It is composed of 92-98% water, and 1% inorganic salts mainly sodium chloride. It also contains simple sugars, polysaccharides, proteins and glycoproteins. Its pH is usually alkaline ranging from 6.5 to 9.0. Ferning is a method used to estimate hormone levels. Ferning refers to the characteristic microscopic pattern that results from the crystallization of the inorganic salts in the cervical mucus when it is dried. As the level of estrogen increases, dried mucus begin to demonstrate ferning in the later pa of follicular phase. Absence of ferning indicates inadequate estrogen stimulation of endocervical glands or inhibition of endocervical glands by increased secretion of progesterone.

Ethylene glycol is metabolized by Alcohol dehydrogenate in the liver to
Glycoaldehyde → Glyoxalic acid → Oxalic acid
Toxicity is caused by oxalic acid
Toxicity occurs in 3 stages
Early symptoms (1-12 hr) - Gastric irritation, nausea, Vomiting, drowsiness, metabolic acidosis begins to develop.
Symptoms at 12-24 hours - Cardiac dysrhythmia, muscle pain, tetany due to hypocalcaemia which occur due to binding and calcium with oxalic acid.
Later stage (After 24 hrs) - Cardiac failure, seizure, cerebral edema and renal failure.
Renal failure is caused due to deposition of calcium oxalate crystal in renal tubules.
Calcium oxalate crystals are commonly seen in urine on microscopy.

Management -

Which enzyme deficiency causes hemolytic anaemia –,G–6–PD,Aldolase,Isomerase,Enolase,"Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency

Normally, RBCs are protected from oxidant injury by reduced glutathione.
Reduced glutathione is generated from oxidized glutathione and the reducing equivalent for this reaction is provided by NADPH.
This NADPH is generated in HMP shunt by enzyme Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, while oxidizing glucose-6-phosphate.
If G6PD is deficient, NADPH production will be reduced that results in increased susceptibility of RBC to oxidative damage because of unavailability of reduced glutathione.
So, whenever there is oxidant stress, e.g. by drugs, infection or foods, hemolysis occurs.
G6PD deficiency causes episodic intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. Important peripheral smear findings → Heinz bodies, Bite cells, Spherocytes.",A

Kostmann's syndrome–treatment is –,Anti–thymocyte globulin + cyclosporin,Anti–thymocyte globulin + cyclosporin + GM–CSF,G–CSF,GM–CSF,"Kostmann's syndrome (severe congenital neutropenia)

Kostmann's syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder, is an inherited disorder of the bone marrow in which there is the arrest of maturation of neutrophils at promyelocyte stage.
There is congenital neutropenia and neutrophils are often completely absent in the blood at the time of diagnosis.
Because of neutropenia, these patients suffer from severe infections e.g., omphalitis (infection of the navel), Pneumonia, Skin abscesses, otitis media.
Kostmann's syndrome is believed to be caused due to defect in the receptor of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) on neutrophils (granulocytes). The purpose of this receptor is the binding of the granulocyte to the cytokine (GCSF) in order to give the signal to the cell to mature and multiply.
Patients with Kostamann's syndrome produce GCSF but because of the defect in GCSF receptor the response of neutrophils to normal amounts of GCSF in the blood is reduced: However, they can respond if the amount of GCSF is increased → These patients will respond to a higher dose of GCSE",C

A female with recurrent aboion and isolated prolonged APTT is most likely associated with,>Lupus anticoagulant,>DIC,>Von wilebrand disease,>Hemophilia,"Lupus anticoagulant They have asked about antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Antiphospholipid antibodies account for 3% to 5% of patients with repetitive pregnancy losses. The frequency of fetal death and recurrent aboion in untreated patients with antiphospholipid antibodies is greater than 90%. There are several antiphospholipid antibodies. The most relevant to obstetricians are: - The lupus anticoagulant (LAC), - The anticardiolipin antibody and - The antibody that cause false positive syphilis test (BFP-ST). The name lupus anticoagulant was derived from the fact that this antibody was found first in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and acted as an anticoagulant by prolonging the paial thromboplastin time (PTT). This name was a poor choice because soon it was found that lupus anticoagulant was present in many patients who did not have lupus and that in majority of patients the antibody was responsible for episodes of thrombosis, rather than anticoagulation. In the laboratory, LAC is not measured directly. - It is assessed by its effect on PTT and the kaolin clotting time. - Typically patients with lupus anticoagulant have a prolonged PTT and a normal PT. - Unfounately, a normal PTT does not exclude the possibility of LAC, and if the clinical suspicion is strong and the PIT is normal a kaolin clotting time or a dilute Russel viper venom time should be performed. - It has also been found that some patients with LAC and recurrent aboions have elevated values of serum 1gM. Other antiphospholipid antibodies The anticardiolipin antibody is the antiphospholipid antibody, most commonly found in patients with repetitive early pregnancy losses. Anlicardiolipin antibody is found in 90% of patients with L.A.C. but the majority of patients with positive anticardiolipin antibody do not have L.A.C. - Anticardiolipin antibody is measured in the laboratory by the ELISA test. BFP-ST - It is the less common antiphospholipid antibody. - Both BFP-ST and Anticardiolipin antibody, measure the antibody against cardiolipin but they are not the same. Clinical features of antiphospholipid antibodies. The presence of any or several of the three antiphospholipid antibodies is associated with - Recurrent early pregnancy losses. - Episodes of venous and aerial thrombosis - Severe preeclampsia - Chorea gravidarum - Pilo ischemic strokes, transient ischemic episodes, migraine headaches. - Postpaum complications such as pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and cardiac symptoms. Aboions in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome - Typically these patients give a history of a live fetus documented by ultrasound or by Doppler before demise or aboion occurs. The majority of the pregnancy losses occur between 14 and 18 weeks. Fetal death is these patients is caused by extensive thrombosis of the placental vessels and the placenta is usually smaller than expected for the gestational age.",A
Bilateral ovarian masses are identified on pelvic examination of a 40 year old woman. Ultrasound examination reveals multiloculated cystic masses involving both ovaries. The patient is treated with total abdominal hysterectomy with removal of both adnexa. Pathologic examination demonstrates papillary carcinoma producing serous fluid. Which of the following tumor markers would be most useful in monitoring for recurrence?,Alpha-fetoprotein,Bombesin,CA-125,PSA,"The tumors are serous papillary cystadenocarcinomas of the ovaries. These tumors express CA-125 and are apparently derived from the surface epithelium of the ovaries. Alpha-fetoprotein is not produced by this type of ovarian tumor, but can be produced by testicular tumors, and less commonly, by ovarian tumors with a yolk sac tumor component. Bombesin is a marker for neuroblastoma, small cell carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. PSA is a marker for prostatic carcinoma.

Polyhydroaminosis is volume of amniotic fluid more than: September 2005,1000 ml,2000 ml,3000 ml,4000 ml,"Ans. B: 2000 ml Because the normal values for amniotic fluid volume increase during pregnancy, the actual volume that constitutes polyhydramnios is dependent on the gestational age of the fetus. Polyhydramnios usually refers to amniotic fluid volumes greater than 2000 ml. The range of fluid values diagnostic of oligohydramnios is not as wide as that for polyhydramnios. Less than 200 ml, or when amniotic fluid index is less than 5 cm, is usually considered to be indicative of oligohydramnios.",B
A couple presents to a clinic for work-up of infeility after 5 years of unprotected intercourse. The wife denies any medical problems and notes regular menstrual cycles. The husband states that he has had chronic sinusitis and lower respiratory tract infections. Physical examination of the woman is unremarkable. Examination of the man is remarkable for dextrocardia. Fuher work-up of the husband will most likely reveal?,Azoospermia,Germinal cell aplasia,Immotile sperm,Isolated gonadotropin deficiency,"The husband is suffering from Kaagener's syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by infeility, situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. The underlying cause of these varied manifestations are defects in the dynein arms, spokes of microtubule doublets of cilia in the airways and the reproductive tract. Since sperm motility is dependent on the functioning of cilia, infeility frequently accompanies this disorder. Situs inversus occurs because ciliary function is necessary for cell migration during embryonic development. Azoospermia is not a feature of Kaagener's syndrome, as sperm production or survival is not affected in this disorder. Germinal cell aplasia, also known as Seoli only syndrome, is characterized by oligospermia or azoospermia.

Oxygenated blood to the fetus is carried by-,Umblical aery,Umblical vein,SVC,Pulmonary aery,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Umblical vein Fetal circulation o Fetal circulation differs from adult circulation in several ways. Almost all differences are attributable to the fundamental difference in the site of gas exchange. o In the adult gas exchange occurs in the lungs, while in the fetus placenta provides the exchange of gases and nutrients. Course of fetal circulation A) Blood returing to hea o Blood oxygenated in the placenta returns by way of the umblical vein, which enter the fetus at the umblicus and course through to join the poal vein. o The ductus venous is a bypass shunt between poal vein and IVC. o Most of the umblical venous blood shunts through the ductus venosus to the IVC. o Blood from IVC (which carries the blood drained from lower extremities, umblical veins, hepatic veins and renal veins) enters the right atrium. o On reaching the right atrium, about 1/3rd of total inferior vena caval return of blood enters the left atrium through formen oval. o The rest two third mixes with the venous return from SVC (which carries the blood drained from head, neck and upper limbs) to enter the right ventricles. B) Blood coming out of the hea Right side o The right ventricle pumps out the blood into pulmonary trunk -4 very small amount of this blood enters the pulmonary circulation because the lungs are collapsed and pulmonary vascular resistance is high. o Most of this blood passes to desending aoa through ductus aeriosus, a shunt between pulmonary trunk and desending Aoa. o Descending aoa carries blood to umblicus through umblical aery, for oxygenation. o Descending aoa also supplies the blood to lower lumbs, kidney and abdominal viscera. Left side o The left ventricle pumps blood into the ascending aoa for distribution in coronary circulation, head and upper limbs.",B
A child presents with sho episodes of vacant stare several times a day. The vacant episode begins abruptly and the child remains unresponsive during the episode. There is no associated history of aura or postictal confusion and the child is otherwise normal. The likely diagnosis is,Grandmal seizures,Absence seizures,Complex paial seizures,Day dreaming,"Answer is B (Absence seizures): Presence of multiple sho episodes of vacant stare (absence) in an otherwise normal child with no history of aura or postictal confusion suggests the diagnosis of typical absence seizures. Absence seizures versus Dav dreaming Absence seizures can easily be confused with episodes day dreaming however there are ceain clues that can help differentiate these two conditions Day dreaming is usually not associated with automatism while automatism is common in seizures. Day dreaming can often be 'broken' with stimulation while seizures can usually not be 'broken'. Day dreaming usually occurs when child is tired /bored or involved in a monotonous activity but seizures can sta abruptly at any time (for example in the middle of a sentence). Abrupt onset of vacant episodes and the fact that the child remains unresponsive during the episode (cannot be broken) ours a diagnosis of absence seizures in this child. Absence seizures versus complex paial seizures Complex paial seizures are frequently associated with aura and postictal confusion. Absence of these features ours a diagnosis of 'Absence seizures' Absence seizures must primarily be differentiated from complex paial seizures and Day dreaming Clinical data Absence Complex paial Daydreaming Frequency/day Multiple Rarely over 1-2 Mutiple; situation-dependent Duration Frequently < 10 sec (Rarely longer than 30 sec) Average duration ober 1 min, 10 sec Seconds to minutes; rarely more rarely less Aura Never Frequently' No Eye blinking Common Occasionally No Automatism Common Frequently No Postictal impairment None Frequently No Seizures activated by 1-11p er yen ti la tio n Very frequently Occassionallv No Photic Frequently Rarely No EEG ktul Generalized spike and wave Usually unilateral or bilateral temporal frontal discharges Normal Interictal Usually normal Variable; may be spikes or sharp waves in frontal or temporal lobes Normal",B

Blind clamping of these vessels presents a risk for ureteral injury; therefore, the ureters should be identified in the retroperitoneal space and traced to the area of bleeding to avoid inadveent ligation' At about the level of the ischial spine, the ureter crosses under the uterine aery in its course through the cardinal ligament; the ureter divides this area into the supraureteric parametrium surrounding the uterine vessels and the infraureteric paracervix molded around the vaginal vessels and extending posteriorly into the uterosacral ligament. In this location, the ureter lies 2 to 3 cm lateral to the cervix and in proximity to the inseion of the uterosacral ligament at the cervix. This proximity warrants caution when using the uterosacral ligament for vaginal vault suspension",C

Infants Tremor Syndrome 

Found in infants & young children
Etiological possibilities are malnutrition, Vit. B12 deficiency & viral infections but none have been conclusively proven.
Boys are twice as commonly affected as girls.
Most cases occur in summer months in children belonging to the low socioeconomic group.
There are 3 clinical phases - prodromal, tremor & post tremor phases.
There is hyperpigmentation, especialy over dorsum of hands, feet, knees ankles, wrists, terminal phalanges & thigh.
At times there may be fever, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhoea, edema, hepatomegaly & a tremulous cry.
Tremor are coarse, fast, 6-12 cycles per second, of low amplitude, initially intermittent but become continuous later on.
There is mild to moderate pallor.
Pnenumoencephaly reveals cortical atrophy. CT scan shows no abnormalities or mild atrophy. - O.P. Ghai.

Organ involvement can also cause more specific symptoms. Bone: The most-frequently seen symptom in both unifocal and multifocal disease is painful bone swelling. The skull is most frequently affected, followed by the long bones of the upper extremities and flat bones. Infiltration in hands and feet is unusual. Osteolytic lesions can lead to pathological fractures. Skin: Commonly seen are a rash which varies from scaly erythematous lesions to red papules pronounced in interiginous areas. Up to 80% of LCH patients have extensive eruptions on the scalp. Bone marrow: Pancytopenia with superadded infection usually implies a poor prognosis. Anemia can be due to a number of factors and does not necessarily imply bone marrow infiltration. Lymph node: Enlargement of the liver in 20%, spleen in 30% and lymph nodes in 50% of histiocytosis cases. Endocrine glands: Hypothalamic pituitary axis commonly involved.

She is usually asymptomatic and has had 3 flares in the past 5 years. She is concerned about exposing her unborn child to infection-What is the most appropriate counsel to offer to this patient.,Administer one dose of acyclovir if she has active genital herpes at the time of delivery.,Administer prophylaxis with acyclovir from now and uptil delivery whether she has active herpes or not.,Perform elective LSCS even if mother is asymptomatic at the time of delivery.,Perform elective LSCS only if mother has active herpes at the time of delivery.,"Herpes Simplex Virus infection in pregnancy:

Most common time of Mother To Child transmission is–at the time of delivery
About 50% women with HSV is first trimister abort while infection in second half can lead to IUGR, preterm labor.
ACOG does not recommend a routine screening for HSV
Viral isolation is the defective means of diagnosis for HSV infection
Specimens are obtained from any active lesions as well as from cervix and vagina
PCR can also be done
DOC during pregnancy-Acyclovir (safe in lactation also) × 7–10 days
ACOG recommends daily viral therapy at or beyond 36 weeks for women who have recurrences during pregnancy as it decreases the outbreaks at term and so decreased need for cesarean Cesarean section is indicated for women with active genital lesions or in patients having prodromal symptoms of herpes viz genital pain and tingling (ans 22). Cesarean is not indicated in women with a h/o HSV infection but no active genital tract lesion/prodromal symptoms at the time of delivery.
If no active breast lesions are present–patient can breastfeed.
Now with this background about HSV infection, lets have a look at the options
Option a: administer one dose of acyclovir if she has active genital herpes at the time of delivery-incorrect as acyclovir should be given for 7–10 days in case of active herpes infection.
Option b: administer prophylaxis with acyclovir from now and uptil delivery whether she has active herpes or not–again incorrect as we have to give acyclovir for 7–10 days, then stop and restart at 36 weeks of gestation.
Option c: perform elective LSCS even if mother is asymptomatic at the time of delivery. – again Incorrect
Option d: perform elective LSCS only if mother has active herpes at the time of delivery. – correct",D

True statement about Minipill is :,Irregular vaginal bleeding may be a side effect,Used in with combination with oral contraceptive pills,Can not be used in lactation,Prevents ectopic pregnancy,"Ans. is a i.e. Irregular vaginal bleeding may be side effect I have already discussed Minipil/Progesterone only pill/Lactation pill/Estrogen free pill in detail in Kindly read the details from there. Here I would like to mention the effect of Minipill on Ectopic pregnancy. 'Ectopic pregnancy is not prevented as effectively as Intrauterine pregnancy. Although the overall incidence of ectopic pregnancy is not increased, When pregnancy occurs (with minipill use) the clinician must suspect that it is more likely to be ectopic. A previous ectopic pregnancy should not be regarded as a contraindication to the minipill.' Also Know : Main side effect of Minipill : Irregular bleeding and amenorrhea. Women on progestin only contraceptive develop more functional ovarian follicular cyst (Most of them regress after minipill is stopped). Minipill are associated with acne, anxiety, headache, dizziness, backache and hair loss. Progestin only pills are associated with a 3 fold increased risk of diabetes mellitus in lactating women with recent Gestational diabetes. There is no indication of increased risk of stroke, MI or venous thromboembolism with progestin only pills. There is no impact on Coagulation system. Minipill is a good alternative for the occasional women who repo diminished libido on combination oral contraceptives, presumably due to decreased androgen level.",A

Most of the ALLs have –,B–cell origin,T–cell origin,NK cell origin,None.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) encompasses a group of neoplasms composed of immature, precursor B (Pre-B) or T (Pre-T) lymphocytes referred to as lymphoblast.
The majority (85%) of all ALLs are precursor -cell tumors that typically manifest as childhood 'leukaemia' with extensive bone marrow and variable peripheral blood involvement.
The less common precursor T-cell ALLs tend to present in adolescent males as 'lymphomas' often with thymic involvement.
The peak incidence of Pre -cell ALL is evident between 3-5 years and ALL is the most common childhood cancer.
Pre T-cell ALL occurs in adolescent male.

Chronic ITP is caused by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins most often 11b-Hla or Ib-IX.
Antibodies reactive with these membrane glycoprotein can be demonstrated in the plasma as well as bound to platelet surface in approximately 80% of the patients.


In overwhelming majority of cases the antiplatelet antibodies are of the IgG class.
The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to that seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Opsonized platelets are rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system.
The spleen is the major site of the destruction of platelets.

According to r-ernando Arias 'In patients with heavy bleeding an efficient management plan including life suppo measures and immediate operative intervention is the only way to avoid a maternal death.' it fuher says- -Patients witn placenta pre and severe bleeding should be delivered by cesarean section irrespective of the type of placenta pre.' So from above discussion it is very much clear that in this patient immediate cesarean section is the best reso. Friends here I want to point out, that this patient has central placenta pre so cesarean section has to be done, but even if heavy bleeding with minor degrees of placenta pre i.e. type I, Type II Anterior is there then too the answer would have been cesarean section and not vaginal delivery.

Alt are true about anthropometric measurements except:,Birth weight triples by 1 year,Skinfold thickness is measured in sub scapular region,Weight is measured to the nearest 100 gram,Standing height is about 1.7 cm less than recumbent length,"Ans: (d) Standing height is about 1.7 cm less than recumbent lengthRef: Pediatrics for Medical Graduates, Arun Babu T, 1st edition, Page 3 5.Weight: It is recommended to weigh children using a scale with the following features:Solidly built and durableElectronic (digital reading)Measures up to 150 kgMeasures to a precision of 0.1 kg (100 g)Allows tared weighing'Tared weighing' means that the scale can be re-set to zero ('tared') with the person just weighed still on it. Thus, a mother can stand on the scale, be weighed, and the scale tared. While remaining on the scale, if she is given her child to hold, the child's weight alone appears on the scale.Tared weighing has two clear advantages:There is no need to subtract weights to determine the child's weight alone (reducing the risk of error).The child is likely to remain calm when held in the mother's arms for weighing,Bathroom scales are not recommended as they tend to be unreliable.Hanging scales are also not reliable when weighing agitated babies,Precision describes the smallest exact unit that the scale can measure.Points to Remember:Birth weight of Indian children 2.8 KgTerm neonate regains lost birth weight by 7 to 10 days, preterm by 10 to 14 daysBirth weight double by 6 months, triples by 1 year, quadruples by 2 years and increases 5 times by 3 years.Age in monthsRate of weight gain (gm/day)10 days to 3 months25-304 to 6 months207 to 9 months1510 to 12 months12Formula for calculating expected weight:Infants of age 3 to 12 months weight (Kg)=(Age in months +9)/2For 1 to 6 years weight (Kg)=(Age in years x2) +8For 7 to 12 years weight (Kg)=/2 or Age in years x3Length:If a child is less than 2 years old, measure recumbent length.If the child is aged 2 years or older and able to stand, measure standing height.In general, standing height is about 0.7 cm less than recumbent length.If a child less than 2 years old will not lie down for measurement of length, measure standing height and add 0.7 cm to convert it to length.If a child aged 2 years or older cannot stand, measure recumbent length and subtract 0.7 cm to convert it to height.Equipment needed to measure length is a length board (sometimes called an infantometer) which should be placed on a flat, stable surface such as a table.To measure height, use a height board (sometimes called a stadiometer) mounted at a right angle between a level floor and against a straight, vertical surface such as a wall or pillar.Child should directly look forwards (in stadiometer) or child should be looking straight up (in infantometer) so that the head is positioned in line with FRANKFURT PLANE (the line joining the floor of external auditory meatus to the lower margin of orbit)Expected height between 2 and 12 years in cm (Weech formula)=(Age in yearsMid-Parental Target HeightIn girl (cm)=(mother's height in cm+father's height in cm-13)/2In boy (cm)=(mother's height in cm+father's height in cm+13)/2Expected adult height (cm)=Mid-Parental target height+-8",D

They probably account for the lower incidence of diarrhea, otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis during the 1st yr of life.e- Macrophages in human milk may synthesize complement, lysozyme, and lactoferrin.- Lactoferrin has an inhibitory effect on the growth of Escherichia coli in the intestine.- The lower pH of the stool of breast-fed infants is thought to contribute to the favorable intestinal flora of infants fed human milk vs. formula (i.e., more bifidobacteria and lactobacilli; fewer E. coli), which also helps protect against infections caused by some species of E. coli.- Human milk also contains bile salt-stimulated lipase, which kills Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica.DISADVANTAGES OF BREAST MILK# Breast milk is balanced, will supply all the necessary nutrients except, perhaps, fluoride and, after several months, vitamin D.# The iron content of human milk is somewhat low. However, most normal infants have sufficient iron stores for the first 6 mo of life. Moreover, human milk iron is well absorbed.# The vitamin K content of human milk also is low and may contribute to hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.

A patient with an infected human bite of the hand requires hospitalization for appropriate drainage procedures, Gram stain and culture of the exudate, vigorous cleaning, debridement, and appropriate antibiotics. The infected wound should be left open and allowed to heal by secondary intention (healing by granulation tissue rather than closure with sutures). Empiric antibiotic therapy for an infected bite should be penicillinase-resistant; amoxicillin-clavulanate orally, or ticarcillin-clavulanate or ampicillin-sulbactam IV are good choices. Antibiotic prophylaxis for noninfected bite wounds remains controversial, but some experts recommend prophylaxis for all significant human bites.",B

All of the following are the indications for myomectomy in a case of fibroid uterus except :,Associated infeility,Recurrent pregnancy loss,Pressure symptoms,Red degeneration,"Ans. is d i.e. Red degeneration From the given options the answer is quite obvious as red degeneration of fibroid is managed conservatively not by any surgery. But here I would like to discuss in detail the surgical management of fibroid and its indications, especially myomectomy (which is being done more frequently these days). Indications of surgical management of fibroid : Fibroid causing symptoms : - Menorrhagiadeg - Chronic / Acute, Pelvic paindeg - Pressure symptoms like urinary retention.deg Fibroid like cornual fibroid causing infeility.deg Sub mucous fibroid causing infeility (Other causes of infeility should be ruled out before surgery).deg Surgical options can be : Myomectomy Hysterectomy Indication of myomectomy : Myomectomy is specifically indicated in an infeile woman or woman desirous of bearing child and wishing to retain the uterus. Indications being the same as for surgery.deg Some specific indications for Hysterectomy : In patients > 40 years of age.deg Multiparous women.deg If fibroid is associated with malignancy.deg During myomectomy if their is uncontrolled hemorrhage or other surgical difficulty.deg If the size of uterus is < 12 weeks vaginal hysterectomy can be done.deg Myomectomy is the enucleation of myomata from the uterus leaving behind a potentially functioning organ capable of future reproduction.deg Prerequisites : Anemia should be corrected.deg - All other causes of infeility should be excluded.deg - Male factor infeility should be ruled out.deg - Diagnostic D and C should be performed in case of irregular cycles, to detect any polyp and to rule out endometrial cancer.deg - Hysteroscopy or HSG : To detect a fibroid encroaching the uterine cavity or a polyp or tubal block.deg Myomectomy is specifically indicated in an infeile woman or woman desirous of bearing child and wishing to retain the uterus.deg Time of myomectomy : It should be performed in preovulatory menstrual phase to reduce blood loss during surgery.deg It should not be performed during pregnancy and at the time of cesarean section.deg Contraindications : Big broad ligament fibroid : (as many large vessels are present which can cause uncontrollable bleeding and thus the need to abandon myomectomy and do hysterectomy.deg Multiple tiny fibroids scattered through the uterine wall.deg Instrument used to decrease blood loss during myomectomy : bonney's myomectomy clamp.deg Myomectomy operation should always be followed by shoening of round ligament to prevent retroversion.deg Bonney's hood technique : is done in interstitial fibroid on the fundal posterior wall.deg Results (Impoant) : Pregnancy rate following myomectomy : 40%deg Aboion rates if woman conceive : 25%deg Myomectomy : Low grade postoperative pyrexia is a rule and should not be treated by antibiotics (pyrexia is d/t slight extravasation of blood in uterine wall or peritoneal cavity and settles spontaneously in 7-14 days). Recurrence rate : 5-10%deg Persisting menorrhagia 1-5%deg Reason for persisting menorrhagia is either myoma was not responsible for the complain or an intrauterine polyp or fibroid was overlooked during surgery. 20 - 25% women subjected to myomectomy : ultimately come for hysterectomy. Routes of myomectomy Abdominal Vaginal myomectomy Myomectomy Done in case of submucosal pedunculated fibroid Hysteroscopic myomectomy Submucosal fibroiddeg which cannot be removed by simple vaginal route can be removed with the help of hysteroscope Laparoscopic Myomectomy Indicated for pedunculated Subserosal fibroids (<10cms in size) Intramural fibroids can also be removed by laparoscope but it is very time consuming Myolysis or myoma coagulation using laser In this procedure lasers are used to drill holes into the substance of intramural myoma",D
Growing fetus derives energy from?,Amino acid,Carbohydrate,Lipid,Minerals,"Ans. (b) CarbohydrateRef: OP Ghai 8th ed./8-9* In order to supply the fetus with energy, the pregnant woman increases her hepatic glucose production by 16-30%. The transfer of glucose from the maternal circulation to the fetus takes placeby facilitated diffusion involving glucose transporter 1.

A newborn baby who was apparently healthy at bih develops aspiration pneumonia in the first two days of life. All attempts to feed the infant cause it to cough and choke. Which of the following abnormalities is the most likely cause of the infant's difficulties?,Bronchogenic cysts,Congenital pulmonary cysts,Posterior detion of the tracheoesophageal septum,Pulmonary immaturity,"The infant probably has esophageal atresia, which is typically caused by posterior detion of the tracheoesophageal septum. Attempts at feeding cause fluid to spill into the trachea, and secondarily cause aspiration pneumonia. Emergent surgical correction is usually required. Bronchogenic cysts are centrally located cysts that are often asymptomatic and may be associated with cysts of other organs. Congenital pulmonary cysts are often multiple and located in the lung periphery without connection to the bronchi; they are vulnerable to infection and rupture complicated by pneumothorax and/or hemoptysis. Pulmonary immaturity produces progressive difficulty in breathing beginning in the first few hours of life. Ref: Thilo E.H., Rosenberg A.A. (2012). Chapter 2. The Newborn Infant. In W.W.

"A 13 -- years -- old young girl presents in the casualty with acute pain in the lower abdomen. She has history of cyclical pain for last 6 months and she has not attained her menarche yet. On local genital examination, a tense bulge in the region of hymen was seen. The most probable diagnosis is :",Mayer Rockitansky Kuster Hauser syndrome,Testicular feminization syndrome,Imperforate hymen,Ashermann's syndrome,"Ans. is c i.e. Imperforate hymen A young girl who has not attained menarche but has history of cyclical pain for last 6 months, presenting to casualty with acute abdomen and on examination a tense bulge in the region of hymen - clearly point towards 'Imperforate hymen' as the diagnosis. Imperforate Hymen : It is the most common cause of cryptomenorrhea. Patients (young girls) present at pubey with Primary Amenorrhea (actually cryptomenorrhea) having not attained menarche. Secondary sexual characteristics are normal. Pathology : In such patients there is cyclical shedding of endometrium and blood, (so, patients give H/0 cyclical pain), which keeps accumulating in the uterine cavity resulting in hematometra. In neglected cases it may lead to distension of tubes Le. hematosalpinx. Patient may present with colicky pain in abdomen, pelvic discomfo or rectal pain. Hematocolpos can cause pressure symptoms like difficulty during micturition which finally ends up with urinary retention. On examination : A tumor, dull on percussion is found in lower abdomen (This could paly be due to distended vagina and uterus and paly by an overfill bladder with hyperophied wall). On separation of labia, bluish bulging membrane is present. Management : Once the diagnosis is made surgical treatment is urgently required, as every menstrual episode fuher dilates the genital tract and threatens permanent impairment of reproductive function. The hymen is incised by a cruciate incision and collected tarry blood is allowed to drain.",C
A child is born with caudal regression syndrome.

A diabetic female at 40 weeks of gestation delivered a baby by elective cesarean section. Soon after birth the baby developed respiratory distress. The diagnosis is:,Transient tachypnea of the newborn,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia,Tracheo oesophageal fistula,Hyaline membrane disease,"Ans. is a, i.e. Transient tachypnea of the newbornRef. Ghai 6/e, p 166, 168; COGDT 10/e, p 316; Williams Obs. 22/e, p 1178, 23/e, p 1116Friends don't get shocked by the answer, even I was perplexed when I went through the texts given in all the standard reference books.Let's see what they have said.Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or hyaline membrane disease (HMD) --Ghai 6/e, p 166RDS almost always occurs in preterm babies often less than 34 weeks of gestation.It is the commonest cause of respiratory distress in a preterm neonate.According to Ghai - RDS is seen in preterm babies and not the term babies (as is given in our question).Now let's see what Ghai says about transient tachypnea of newborn;Transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN) --Ghai 6/e, p 168Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a benign self-limiting disease occurring usually in term neonates and is due to delayed clearance of lung fluid.These babies have tachypnea with minimal or no respiratory distress.Chest X-ray may show prominent vascular marking and prominent interlobar fissure.Oxygen treatment is often adequate and ventilatory support is necessary and prognosis is good.But Ghai didn't mention any correlation between TTN and Diabetes. So, I had to search other books for more information. COGDT 10/e, p 316 says:Neonatal complications: RDS and transient tachypnea are more common in infants of women with poorly controlled diabetics.In this way we can derive some correlation between diabetes and TTN.Our answer is further strengthened by Williams Obs. 22/e, p 1178, 23/e, p 1116 which says -Respiratory distress:'Conventional obstetrical teaching through the late 1980s generally held that fetal lung maturation was delayed in diabetic pregnancies. Thus, these infants were at increased risk for respiratory distress (Gluck and Kulovich, 1973). Subsequent observations have challenged this concept, and gestational age rather than overt diabetes is likely the most significant factor associated with neonatal respiratory distress (Berkowitz and colleagues, 1996; Kjos and colleagues, 1990b)'.So, it is the gestational age and not diabetes which is the main factor causing neonatal respiratory distress.In our question the baby is delivered at 40 weeks gestation (Full term) so, the answer cannot be Hyaline membrane disease rather it is transient tachypnea of newborn (i.e. option 'a' is correct).",A

The mode of transmission of tuberculosis to the endometrium is ___________,Hematogenous,Lymphatic spread,Retrograde spread,Local spread,"Endometrial tuberculosis is most commonly accquired by direct spread from the fallopian tubes. Genital Tuberculosis: Female genital tuberculosis is an impoant cause of significant morbidity, sho and long-term sequelae especially infeility. Genital tuberculosis usually occurs secondary to pulmonary (commonest) or Extrapulmonary TB like gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, skeleta; system, meninges, and miliary TB. However, Primary genital TB can rarely occur in women whose male paners have active genitourinary TB (e.g., tuberculosis epididymis) by transmission through infected semen Most common site involved in secondary genital TB is Fallopian tube (90-100%) > Endometrium (50-80%) > Ovaries (20-30%) > Cervix (5-15%) > Vulva The most common symptom of genital TB is infeility Causes of infeility in Genital TB : Tubal blockage If tubes are patent, then also infeility occurs due to loss of tubal function Tubercular endometritis causes uterine scarring resulting in the destruction of the endometrium Ovarian damage with poor ovarian reserve and volume Hematogenous spread is thought to be the process by which the tubercle bacillii implant into the mucosa of the fallopian tubes and subsequently affect the endometrium by direct extension. A laparoscopy and dye hydrotubation (lap and dye test) is the most reliable tool to diagnose genital TB, especially for the tubal, ovarian and peritoneal disease. The test can be combined with hysteroscopy. Multiple drug therapy (ATT regimen provided by DOTS) in adequate doses and for sufficient duration is the mainstay in the treatment of TB including genital tuberculosis.

Influenza vaccine cause ?,Local swelling,Fever,Itching,All of above,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., All of above Mild problems following inactivated flu vaccine: Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given Hoarseness Sore, red or itchy eyes Cough Fever Aches Headache Itching Fatigue If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1 or 2 days. Moderate problems following inactivated flu vaccine: Young children who get inactivated flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) at the same time may be at increased risk for seizures caused by fever. Ask your doctor for more information. Tell your doctor if a child who is getting flu vaccine has ever had a seizure. Problems that could happen after any vaccine: Brief fainting spells can happen after any medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. Severe shoulder pain and reduced range of motion in the arm where a shot was given can happen, very rarely, after a vaccination. Severe allergic reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at less than 1 in a million doses. If one were to occur, it would usually be within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.",D
"A primigravida with full term pregnancy in labor for 1 day is brought to casualty after dia handing.

What would be the best management option after initial work-up?",Cesarean section,Oxytocin drip,Ventouse delivery,Craniotomy and vaginal delivery,"Well friends lets first analyse the condition of patient and then think about its management:

Patient is primigravida
On examination:

– Dehydration is present
– P/R is 100/min, i.e. tachycardia present.
PIA

Fundal height-36 weeks
Presentation-cephalic
FHS-Absent
Mild uterine contractions are present.

P/V

Cervix-fully dilated
Station = + 1
Caput present
Moulding present
Dirty infected discharge is present.

Most importantly–Pelvis is adequate.
This patient is undoubtedly a case of obstructed labour. As we all know in nulliparous females in case of obstructed labour— a state of uterine exhaustion is reached manifested as weakened uterine conditions.

In such cases, if oxytocin drip is given it may lead to rupture of uterus as lower segment is thinned out (i.e. option ‘b’ ruled out).
Craniotomy and other destructive procedures are not carried out in modern obstetrics (i.e., option ‘d’ ruled out).

All are characteristics of Autism except,Onset often age of 6 years,Repeatitive behaviour,Delayed language development,Severe deficit in social interaction,"These are some of the characteristics of ASD: problems with social interaction with others. This may include problems talking back and foh, working, or playing with others. unusual interest in objects need for sameness great variation in abilities under or over reaction to one or more of the five senses: sight, touch, taste, smell, or hearing repeated actions or body movements unusual emotional reactions and expressions Children with ASD usually have difficulty with social interaction. Some parents have said that before their child's diagnosis of ASD, they thought their child was just very shy. Children with ASD may have an unusual interest in objects. They may play with toys in different or unusual ways. For example, they may be able to tell you everything you need to know about car engines. Or they may be able to sit for hours spinning the wheels on a toy vehicle. Children with ASD often have a need for sameness. They may have difficulty with changes in routines, clothes, food, caregivers, and other pas of their environment. Children with ASD may have great ability in one area and great difficulty in another. But not all children with ASD have the same abilities. For example: A child with ASD may have difficulty holding a pencil but have a strong memory for the words of songs or movies. On the other hand, they could be fabulous aists or have perfect pitch. A child may have difficulty knowing how to play a game with a peer but may have a very good understanding of how computers work. A child who does not speak may be able to build complex structures out of Lego. Children with ASD may also have unusually strong reactions to one or more of their five senses. For example, some children with ASD may react to bright sunlight. Others are excessively bothered by tags on their clothing or by loud noises. Many children may be bothered by these things, but children with ASD often have a stronger reaction to them. Children with ASD often have difficulty with the colour, smell, or texture of ceain foods. This may limit what they will eat to only a few foods. Children with ASD may also do the same thing over and over again. For example, they may repeatedly flap their hands, jump, or walk on tiptoes. This is common. It is something that many parents talk about when they describe their children. Your child may be doing these things to help calm themself during stressful situations or to help occupy or enteain themself. Children with ASD may also have unusually intense and prolonged emotional reactions. For example, they may get very angry when asked to stop playing and get ready for lunch. These emotions do not match the situation they find themselves in. These reactions may occur as a result of anxiety they feel when making changes in routine. Children with ASD may talk constantly about specific things that interest them and be unaware that other people might not have the same level of interest.

Which hormone produced by the human placenta has LH-like activity?,Progesterone,Testosterone,Human chorionic gonadotropin,Luteinizing hormone,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced in large quantities by the human placenta. It is used as a pregnancy indicator around 2-weeks post copulation. This hormone is composed of an alpha and a beta subunit. Like other gonadotropins, hCG is also glycosylated which influences biological activity. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is often used as an exogenous source of LH to try and induce ovulation in some of the domestic species. Ref: Taylor R.N., Badell M.L. (2011). Chapter 16.

Cells that are more spherical, with a decreased surface/volume ratio have a limited capacity to expand in hypotonic solutons and lyse at a higher concentration of Nacl than do normal biconcave cells.

These cells are said to have increased osmotic fragility and are seen in hereditary spherocytosis 

Conversely, cells that are hypochronic and flatter have a greater capacity to expand in hypotonic solutions, lyse at lower concentration, are said to have decreased osmotic fragility.
These cells with increased surface/volume ratio are osmotically resistant and are seen in iron deficiency, thalassemia, liver disease and reticulocytosis.",D

For which of the following conditions is this patient at highest risk?",Dystocia,Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD),Placenta accreta,Preeclampsia,"Placenta pre is defined as a placenta located over the cervical os. There are 3 major types. Complete pre describes a placenta that completely covers the cervical os. Paial pre is a placenta that covers some of the cervical os, with the remainder of the os uncovered by the placenta. Marginal pre describes a placenta that is located at the edge of the cervical os. Three major risk factors for placenta pre are maternal age, minority race, and previous cesarean delivery. Placenta accreta describes the condition in which there is abnormal attachment of the placenta to the uterine wall. In this condition, the decidua basalis is absent and the placenta is attached to the myometrium(accreta) or invades into the myometrium (increta) or perforates through the myometrium (percreta). Many patients with a pre and accreta will require a hysterectomy at the time of delivery. This patient, with a history of 2 prior cesarean deliveries and a placenta pre is at highest risk for placenta accreta. This patient would not be considered to be at highest risk of dystocia (Choice A) because, with a placenta pre, she would not be allowed to labor and, therefore, would not be at risk of dystocia",C

Drug of choice in Absence Seizure,Carbamazepine,Phenytoin,ACTH,Ethosuximide,"Ethosuximide is the drug of choice in Absence seizures. Ethosuximide: Ethosuximide (Zarontin), a succinimide, has been considered an effective agent for the treatment of absence seizures since the mid-20th century.Although ethosuximide's mechanism of action is not fully understood, the blockade of a specific voltage-gated calcium channel (the T channel) in thalamic neurons appears integral to its antiepileptic activity. This blockade suppresses thalamic excitability, which is thought to be necessary for sustaining the characteristic spike-wave discharge of absence seizures. Serious adverse events linked to ethosuximide include agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and systemic lupus erythematosus; however, these occur rarely and the medication is generally well tolerated.

Before 5 weeks of gestation, hCG is expressed in both cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast. Later during gestation, when maternal serum levels peak, hCG is produced almost solely in syncytiotrophoblasts. Plasma levels of hCG begin to decline at 10 to 12 weeks and a nadir is reached about 16 weeks. Plasma levels are maintained at this lower level for the remainder of pregnancy.

"A 6-year-old child has had repeated episodes of otitis media. She undergoes an uneventful surgical placement of pressure-equalization (PE) tubes. In the recovery room, she develops a fever of 40degC (104degF), rigidity of her muscles, dark colored urine, and metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Which of the following therapies is most likely to be beneficial for this child's condition?",Acidification of the urine,Administration of intravenous antibiotics after obtaining blood cultures,Intravenous administration of dantrolene,Administration of tetanus immuno globulin and a booster dose of DTaP,"In addition to the findings listed in the question, patients experiencing malignant hyperthermia (MH) also have clinical findings of tachycardia, arrhythmia, tachypnea, and cyanosis, as well as laboratory findings of myoglobinuria, elevated serum creatine kinase levels, and evidence of acute renal failure. This myopathy is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait; the gene is on chromosome 19 and codes for the ryanodine receptor, a calcium release channel. A family history of similarly affected relatives would suggest the need to evaluate all family members for this condition; prevention (or treatment) is with dantrolene sodium. The test of choice to identify a patient at risk for this condition is the caffeine contracture test, in which a muscle biopsy tissue specimen is attached to a strain gauge and then exposed to caffeine. Patients at risk for MH have a diagnostic muscle spasm. Ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene sequencing is also available.Acidification of the urine might be helpful for an aspirin overdose, but the child has no history of having aspirin ingestion. The findings in the question do not support tetanus (immunoglobulins not helpful) nor seizure activity (diazepam not indicated). The rapid nature of this child's change in status makes septicemia unlikely; antibiotics and blood cultures likely are not warranted.",C

All of the following are the indications for myomectomy in a case of fibroid uterus except:,Associated infertility,Recurrent pregnancy loss,Pressure symptoms,Red degeneration,"From the given options the answer is quite obvious as red degeneration of fibroid is managed conservatively not by any surgery. But let us rule out other options also.
Indication of myomectomy: Myomectomy is specifically indicated in an infertile woman, in recurent abortions and patients with symptomatic fibroid but desirous of bearing child and wishing to retain the uterus.
Thus, option a and b are ruled out. As far as pressure symptoms are concerned, it means fibroid is symptomatic and all symptomatic fibroids need surgical management which could either be myomectomy or hysterectomy.",D

Best indicator for nutritional status for a child is –,Mid arm circumference,Head circumference,Rate of increase of height and weight,Chest circumference,"Health and development are intimately interconnected.
Proper nutrition of children is fundamental to the achievement of sustainable development.
Anthropometric measurements are the most widely used indicators of nutritional status in a community.
The commonly used anthropometric measurements are -
Weight  
Length / height   
Arm circumference                              
Chest circumference
Skinfold thickness          

Measurement of weight and rate in gain in weight are the best single parameters for assessing physical growth.

The comparison of a child's height and weight with the standard growth chart helps to determine if the particular child is within the expected normal range for his age, sex and socioeconomic status.
It does not indicate if the rate of growth of child was normal in the recent past.
The point to stress here is that it is very difficult to recognize a recent disturbance in growth by comparing weight or height with the reference standards because a clearly abnormal percentile position on the growth chart becomes evident only when the factors retarding growth are profound or if they have persisted for a considerable time.
Measurement of the velocity of growth or increment in unit time is a better tool for early identification of factors affecting growth and also for assessment of the usefulness of social and remedial measures.",C

Which mutation is seen in Down's syndrome -,Monosomy X,Trisomy 21,Trisomy 22,Trisomy 13,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Trisomy 21 o Basic molecular defect in Down's syndrome is extragenetic material of chromosome 21. It may be due to :1) Trisomy 21# This is the most common cause (95%). There is an extra chromosome 21 (i.e. three 21 chromosomes) which is due to meiotic nondisjunction in ovum. The extra chromosome is of maternal origin. The most important risk factor is advanced maternal age (> 35 years).2) Roberston translocation# This accounts for 3% of cases. Extra material of 21 chromosome comes from Robertson tanslocation of long arm of chromosome 21 to another acrocentric chromosome (22, or 14 or 15), i.e. t (22: 21), t (14:21), or t (15:21). It has no relation with maternal age.3) Mosaicism (Mosaic 21)# In 2% of patients there is mosaicism, i.e. occurance of two or more different types of cell population (46 XX / 47 XX + 21) in same individual, due to mitotic nondisjunction of chromosome 21. There is no correlation withmaternal age.4) Partial trisomy# It is very-very rare. The long arm of chromosome 21 triplicates.",B

Most vulnerable period for teratogenicity during fetal development is,1st and 2nd week post feilization,3rd to 8th week post feilization,10th to 12th week post feilization,18th to 20th week post feilization,"The preimplantation period is the 2 weeks from feilisation to implantation and is known as the 'all or none' period. As the zygote undergoes cleavage, an insult damaging a large number of cells typically causes embryonic death.However if few cells are injured compensation may be possible, with normal development. The embryonic period is from the 2nd -8th week post feilisation, encompasses organogenesis and is thus the most critical period with regard to structural malformations. The fetal period, which is beyound 8 weeks, is characterised by continued maturition and functional development and during this time, ceain organs remain vulnerable.

Which of the following mechanisms best explains the contraceptive effect of bih control pills that contain both synthetic estrogen and progestin?,Direct inhibition of oocyte maturation,Inhibition of ovulation,Production of uterine secretions that are toxic to developing embryos,Impairment of implantation hyperplastic changes of the endometrium,"The primary effect is to suppress gonadotropins at the time of the midcycle LH surge, thus inhibiting ovulation. The prolonged progestational effect also causes thickening of the cervical mucus and atrophic changes of the endometrium, thus impairing sperm penetrability and ovum implantation, respectively. Thus, the Progestational agents in oral contraceptives work by a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit the secretion of LH and, as a result, prevent ovulation. They also cause decidualization and atrophy of the endometrium, thereby making implantation impossible. Progestins do not prevent irregular bleeding. Estrogen in bih control pills enhances the negative feedback of the progestins and stabilizes the endometrium to prevent irregular menses.",B

"A 5-year-old boy is brought into the ER immediately after an unfortunate altercation with a neighbor's immunized Chihuahua that occurred while the child was attempting to dress the dog as a superhero. The fully immunized child has a small, irregular, superficial laceration on his right forearm that has stopped bleeding. His neuromuscular examination is completely normal, and his perfusion is intact. Management should include which of the following?",Irrigation and antimicrobial prophylaxis,Tetanus booster immunization and tetanus toxoid in the wound,Copious irrigation,Primary rabies vaccination for the child,"Mammalian bites should be promptly and thoroughly scrubbed with soap and water and debrided. The decision to suture depends on the location, age, and nature of the wound. Antibiotic prophylaxis is extremely controversial. Most experts suggest a short course of antibiotics should be started for cat, human, or monkey bites. Only 4% of dog bites become infected (and therefore do not necessarily need antibiotic prophylaxis), compared with 35% of cat bites and 50% of monkey bites (which require antibiotics in most cases). Cat bites are usually deep punctures. Human bites almost invariably become infected.The etiologies of these infections are polymicrobial. Pasteurella multocida is a common organism in infected cat and dog bites. Infected human bites tend to have positive cultures for S viridans, S aureus, and Eikenella corrodens. Treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate orally or ampicillin- sulbactam IV is recommended. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for any bite sustained by an infant, a diabetic, or an immunocompromised patient because of the higher risk of infection in these persons. Since the child is fully immunized, tetanus boosters are not required. Similarly, as the dog was provoked and was fully immunized, rabies should not be a concern.",C
Involution of uterus occurs at the rate of: September 2009,1.0 cm/day,1.25 cm/day,1.5 cm/day,2.0 cm/day,"Ans.

But, by the 7th day, the uterus becomes much smaller and only its upper border can just be felt at the level of the symphysis. The size of the uterus decreases at the rate of 1.25 cm (1/2 inches) per 24 hours in the first 14 days of the postpaum period. It regains its pre-pregnancy size at the end of 6 weeks. By the end of 2 weeks uterus becomes a pelvic organ.",B

Baholins cyst 7 It is the commonest cyst of vulva. Baholins cyst are produced from accumulation of secretions of Baholins gland. The cyst may develop either in the duct (more common) or in the gland Aetiology : cyst formation occurs due to the obstruction of the main duct or opening of an acinus. The cause of obstruction is usually fibrosis which follows either infection or trauma. It was formerly believed that the infection was invarialy gonococcal but almost any orgnaism can be responsible. Left Baholins gland is more often affected than the right. Presentation : Usually presents as a unilateral swelling that bulges across the vaginal introitus. Size of the cyst rarely exceeds hens egg. Swelling is present characteristically on the inner side of the junction of the anterior 2/3rd with posterior 1/3rd of the labium majus. The swelling is fluctuant and usually non tender.

A 19-year old patient complains of primary amenorrhea. She had well developed breast and public hair but on examination there was absence of uterus and vagina. Likely diagnosis is:,XYY,Mullerian agenesis,Gonadal dysgenesis,Klinefelter syndrome,"In the question a 19 year old girl is presenting with primary amenorrhea, she has well developed breast and public hair but on examination uterus and vagina are absent. Since her breast and public hair both are well developed- this means her secondary sexual characteristics are well developed.
This means in this female amount of estrogen is adequate, which means she has normally functioning ovaries.
Thus, options XYY (presence of Y Chromosome means- gonads are testis), Klienfelter’s syndrome (genotype = 47XXY- again since Y chromosome is present, gonads are testes i.e. they are males) are ruled out and in gonadal dysgenesis gonads are incompletely formed and are streak gonads, M/c example is Turner’s syndrome - genotype 45X0. Since gonads are streak, therefore estrogen is insufficient so secondary sexual characteristics are not well developed. In Turners thus by exclusion, our answer is option b- i.e. Mayer Rokitanskv kuster hauser syndrome.",B

"All of the following are associated with placental abruption, EXCEPT:",Cocaine abuse,Cigarette smoking,Hypotension,Pre-eclampsia,"Placental abruption occurs when a previously normally implanted placenta separates from the endometrial wall. This can occur secondarily to vascular changes or mechanical sheer forces. Both cocaine and cigarette smoking result in vascular constriction which results in acute vasospasm, elevated total peripheral resistance, and an acute increase in maternal blood pressure. These phenomena are believed to be associated with an increased rate of placental abruption. Hypeension, not hypotension, is associated with abruption. Acute hypotension can, however, cause fetal distress if untreated and may result in a similar fetal hea rate tracing to that associated with an abruption. Similarly, pre-eclampsia with elevated blood pressures is associated with abruptions. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 35.

"Chromosomal analysis of all of the following genotype shows Barr bodies, EXCEPT:",XO,XXY,XX,XXX,"Routine microscopy of mammalian cell nuclei reveals a small, dense mass of heterochromatin present in females but not males. This 'sex chromatin' (or Barr body or X-chromatin) is one of the two X chromosomes present in females. As a general rule, only 1 X chromosome functions in a cell at a given time. All other X chromosomes present in a cell may be seen as X-chromatin bodies in a resting nucleus. Thus, if one knows the number of X chromosomes, one can anticipate that the number of Barr bodies will be 1 less.

Poor indicator to response during treatment of malnutrition includes –,Presence of edema on day 10,Failure to gain at least 5g/kg/day by day 10,Failure to gain at least 5g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days during the rehabilitation phase,All of these,"Guidelines on Hospital based management of severely malnourished children

The curent guidelines recommended in-patient (hospital) management of all severely malnourished children are divided into ten essential steps:


Treat/prevent hypoglycemia
Treat/prevent hypothermia
Treat/prevent dehydration
Correct electrolyte imbalance
Treat/prevent infection
Correct micronutrient deficiencies
Start cautious feeding
Achieve catch-up growth
Provide sensory stimulation and emotional support
Prepare for follow-up after recovery.

Monitoring progress  during treatment

Good weight gain is >10 g/kg/day and indicates a good response. It is recommended to continue with the same treatment.
Moderate weight gain is 5-10 g/kg/day; food intake should be checked and the children should be screened for systemic infection.
Poor weight gain is < 5g/kg/day, screening for inadequate feeding, untreated infection, tuberculosis and psycho-logical problems is recommended.

Indicators of failure to respond 

Primary failure to respond is indicated by:
Failure to regain appetite by day 4.
Failure to start losing edema by day 4.
Presence of edema on day 10.
Failure to gain at least 5.g/kg/day by day 10.
Secondary failure to respond is indicated by
failure to gain at least 5g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days during the rehabilitation phase.

Which of the following Is responsible for pubeal growth in females :,Decreased level of adrenal androgens at pubey,High level of estrogen at pubey,Pulsatile release of GnRH during sleep,Increased sensitivity of HPO axis to estrogen,"The onset of pubey is associated with high GnRH pulsing, which precedes the rise in sex hormones, LH and FSH. Exogenous GnRH pulses cause the onset of pubey. Brain tumors which increase GnRH output may also lead to premature pubey.The cause of the GnRH rise is unknown. Leptin might be the cause of the GnRH rise. Leptin has receptors in the hypothalamus which synthesizes GnRH. Individuals who are deficient in leptin fail to initiate pubey. The levels of leptin increase with the onset of pubey, and then decline to adult levels when pubey is completed. The rise in GnRH might also be caused by genetics. A study discovered that a mutation in genes encoding both Neurokinin B as well as the Neurokinin B receptor can alter the timing of pubey. The researchers hypothesized that Neurokinin B might play a role in regulating the secretion of Kisspeptin, a compound responsible for triggering direct release of GnRH as well as indirect release of LH and FSH.",C

"All of the following strategies are effective in preventing mother to child transmission of IV, except -",Zidovudine to mother & baby,Vaginal cleansing before delivery,Stopping breast feeding,Elective caesarean section,"Methods to prevent vertical transmission
a) Antiretroviral prophylaxis-

Vertical transmission can be prevented substantially by giving antiretroviral therapy to mother and early prophylaxis to newborn.

b) Caesarean delivery -

Elective caesarean section reduces the risk of transmission by 50% in women with or without ZDV treatment.

c) Breast feeding -

Because breast milk can carry the virus, breastfeeding by HIV infected mothers is contraindicated.
However, Dutta/obs writes -

'In the developing world, where alternative forms of infant nutrition are not safe, the minor risk associated with breastfeeding may be accepted. Mother is counselled as regards the risk and benefits. She is helped to make an informed choice.'",B
"All of the following mechanisms might account for a reduce risk of upper genital tract infection in users of progestin - releasing IUDs, except :",Reduced retrograde menstruation,Decreased ovulation,Thickened cervical mucus,Decidual changes in the endometrium,"Ans. is b i.e. Decreased ovulation Several mechanisms account for a potential reduced risk of upper-genital-tract infection in users of progestin releasing IUDs. First, the local effect of progestin on cervical mucus make it thick and relatively impenetrable to bacteria. Since uterine bleeding is eventually greatly decreased in users of the LNG-IUD (progestin releasing IUD), any retrograde menstruation (which might seed the fallopian tubes with bacteria) should be reduced as well. In addition, decidual changes in the endometrium may make it less susceptible to infection. In other words, progestin-releasing IUDs may mimic the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate against upper-genital-tract infection. Also know : PID is common in non hormonal IUCD. IUCD related bacterial infections are due to contamination of endometrial cavity at the time of inseion. Actinomycosis infection is related to IUCD use. Most common side effect of 1UCD's is increased vaginal bleeding. 2nd most common side effect of IUCD : Pain in Lower back or cramps in lower abdomen.",B

"To diagnosis foetal wellbeing of foetus, most reliable method -(UPSC 97)",L:S ratio,HPL levels,Kick test,Ultrasound,"To get started, sit with your feet up or lie on your side. Count each of your baby'smovements as one kick, and count until you reach 10 kicks or movements. Most of the time it will take less than a half-hour, but it could take as long as two hours. Log your recorded times into a Count the Kicks chart. The lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (aka L-S or L/S ratio) is a test of fetal amniotic fluid to assess for fetal lung immaturity. Lungs require surfactant, a soap-like substance, to lower the surface pressure of the alveoli in the lungs. Human placental lactogen (hPL), also called human chorionic somatomammotropin (HCS), is a polypeptide placentalhormone, the human form of placental lactogen (chorionic somatomammotropin). Its structure and function are similar to those of human growth hormone. It modifies the metabolic state of the mother during pregnancy to facilitate the energy supply of the fetus. hPL has anti-insulin properties. hPL is a hormone secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast during pregnancy. Like human growth hormone, hPL is encoded by genes on chromosome 17q22-24. HPL is present only during pregnancy, with maternal serum levels rising in relation to the growth of the fetus and placenta. Maximum levels are reached near term, typically to 5-7 mg/L. Higher levels are noted in patients with multiple gestation. Little hPL enters the fetal circulation. Its biological half-life is 15 minutes.",D

Training and awareness rising Hypothermia Prevention Newborn Infants The bihing room should have ambient temperature of at least 25degC and should be free from drafts of air (keep windows and doors closed).After delivery, the baby should be dried immediately, put in skin-to-skin contact on mother's abdomen and covered by warm and dry linen. The wet towel should be discarded. The baby should be capped and dressed adequately (Fig. 9.19). Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is an effective way to keep LBW baby warm.Frequent breastfeeding is critical to provide energy to keep the baby warm. Bathingandweighingarepostponed.Termbabiescan be sponged after 24 hours of life in summer months. Bathing should be postponed during winters and in sick or LBW babies until the umbilical cord falls off (end of first week). Dressing the baby in multiple layers of warm and light clothes provides better thermal protection than a single layer of heavy woolen clothing. Mother and baby should be kept on the same bed (co- bedding/rooming in). * Warm transpoation: This is the weakest link in the warm chain with greatest possibility of severe and undetected hypothermia. * Training/awareness of healthcare providers: Unless persons involved in the care of newborns realize the implications of hypothermia, it cannot be detected or managed effectively. Evidence shows that KMC:* Is as good as incubator care in terms of safety andthermal protection",D
A 1 year old child is brought to you with delayed milestones. On examination you note that the child is very fair with hypopigmented hair and blue eye. He has also got eczemas. The child was also very irritable. What is your diagnosis?,Albinism,Phenylketonuria,Alkaptonuria,Cystinosis,"This child is suffering from Phenylketonuria. Here there is inability to conve phenylalanine to tyrosine due to phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. The decreased pigmentation in this condition is due to reduced melanin formation. The treatment is a diet low in phenylalanine with tyrosine supplementation. Delay in initiation of treatment will lead to mental retardation.

It is found in about 7% of term placentas.* Velamentous insertion: This type of insertion is of considerable clinical importance. The umbilical vessels spread within the membranes at a distance from the placental margin, which they reach surrounded only by a fold of amnion. As a result, vessels are vulnerable to compression, which may lead to fetal anoxia. Incidence: 1%",B

Each year, a diagnosis of PID is made in more than 1 million women. Sexually active teenagers are at great risk of acquiring PID because of their high-risk behavior, exposure to multiple partners, and failure to use contraceptives. The strong likelihood of PID in the patient presented should not preclude consideration of serious conditions requiring surgical intervention, such as appendiceal abscess, ectopic pregnancy, and ovarian cyst. Renal cyst does not present in the manner described. An episode of PID raises the risk of ectopic pregnancy, and about 20% of women become infertile following one episode of PID.

During pregnancy there is reduced risk of which of the following condition?,Relapse of multiple sclerosis,Bell's palsy,Meningeoma,Chorea,"Ans. A. Relapse of multiple sclerosisThe onset of a new movement disorder during pregnancy suggests chorea gravidarum, a variant of Sydenham's chorea associated with rheumatic fever and streptococcal infection; the chorea may recur with subsequent pregnancies. Patients with preexisting multiple sclerosis experience a gradual decrease in the risk of relapses as pregnancy progresses and, conversely, an increase in attack risk during the postpartum period. Beta interferons should not be administered to pregnant MS patients, but moderate or severe relapses can be safely treated with pulse glucocorticoid therapy. Finally, certain tumors, particularly pituitary adenoma and meningioma, may manifest during pregnancy because of accelerated growth, possibly driven by hormonal factors.Peripheral nerve disorders associated with pregnancy include Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis), which is approximately threefold more likely to occur during the third trimester and immediate postpartum period than in the general population.",A
True about co-arctation of aoa -,Most common site is distal to the origin of the left subclan aery,Most common age of presentation is at 15-20 years,Upper rib notching is due to erosion by dilated collateral vessels,Right ventricular hyperophy,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Most common site is distal to the origin of left subclan aery Most common site of COA is distal to the origin of left subclan aery. Hemodynamics of COA during fetal life o In fetal life, blood from right ventricle passes to pulmonary aery and then to descending aoa through ductus aeriosus. o Blood from left ventricle passes to Aoa and then to innominate, left carotid and left subclan aery. o If constriction (coarctation) is proximal to ductus aeriosus (preductal or infantile coarctation), there is no obstruction to flow because constriction is not obstructing the flow of upper limb and lower limb ---> Collaterals are not formed. o If the constriction is distal to ductus aeriosus (post ductal or adult type coarctation of aoa), it causes obstruction of flow of desending aoa, and pas of body that are supplied by descending aoa, have impaired circulation -4 This stimulates formation of collaterals in fetal life. Hemodvnamics after bih o After bih, ductus aeriosus closes, so that blood flow to descending aoa from right ventricle does not occur and descending aoa must receive its total supply from left ventricle ascending aoa. o But there is obstruction due to coarctation. o In preductal coarctation, there are no collaterals --> Neonates become symptomatic immediatly --> Hypeension results in CHF. o In postductal coarctation, due to presence of collaterals neonates are spared from developing hypeension & CHF. o Due to obstruction, there is pressure overload to left ventricle Left ventricular hyperophy.",A

Best prognosis in infeile women is seen in / most reversible form of infeility is :,Tubal block,Anovulation,Oligospermia,Endometritis,"Ans. is b i.e. Anovulation 'Disorders of ovulation account for about 30 - 40 % of all cases of female infeility. These disorders are generally among the most easily diagnosed and most treatable causes of infeility.' In couples with infeility ovulatory disorder have the best prognosis. Relatively poor prognosis is observed in male factor infeility and tuba! factor infeility. Prognosis can be arranged as below in descending order on the basis of cumulative pregnancy. Ovulatory factor > unexplained > Male factors > Endometriosis > Tubal factors. Treatment of anovulation is determined by the diagnosis : An elevated FSH along with chronic anovulation indicates ovarian resistance or failure : treatment is steroids / in vitro feilisation in such cases. If chronic anovulation is present along with normal FSH and prolactin : then induction of ovulation can be achieved in 90% of cases. - A treatment plan is done using clomiphene as the first drug : 1. Colmiphene citrate : it is the agent of choice for women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea having sufficient ovarian function to maintain estrogen at a serum level of 40pg/ml. Patient selection Normal gonadotropicdeg : normoprolactinemicdeg patients with normal cycle but absent or infrequent ovulation.deg PCOSdeg Post pill amenorrhea.deg Dose Initial dose of 25 to 50mgdeg is given daily from 02 - D 5. Ovulation is expected to occur about 5 - 7 days after the last day of therapy. If ovulation doesnot occur, dose is increased in 50mg steps to a maximum of 250mg daily. Therapy is in given for 4-6 cycles. Clomiphene will be successful in inducing ovulation in about 70% of women, with ovaries producing estrogen.

"A 32-year-old G2P1001 at 20 weeks gestational age presents to the emergency room complaining of constipation and abdominal pain for the past 24 h. The patient also admits to bouts of nausea and emesis since eating a very spicy meal at a new Thai restaurant the evening before. She denies a history of any medical problems. During her last pregnancy, the patient underwent an elective cesarean section at term to deliver a fetus in the breech presentation. The emergency room doctor who examines her pages you and reports that the patient has a low-grade fever of 100degF, with a normal pulse and blood pressure. She is minimally tender to deep palpation with hypoactive bowel sounds. She has no rebound tenderness. The patient has a WBC of 13,000, and electrolytes are normal. What is the appropriate next step in the management of this patient?","The history and physical exam are consistent with constipation, which is commonly associated with pregnancy; the patient should be discharged with reassurance and instructions to give herself a soapsuds enema and follow a high-fiber diet with laxative use as needed",The patient should be prepped for the operating room immediately to have an emergent appendectomy,The patient should be reassured that her symptoms are due to the spicy meal consumed the evening before and should be given Pepto-Bismol to alleviate the symptoms,The patient should be sent to radiology for an upright abdominal x-ray,"This patient's history and physical exam are consistent with an intestinal obstruction. An intestinal obstruction must be ruled out because, if it goes undiagnosed and untreated, it can result in a bowel perforation. This patient has a history of a previous abdominal surgery, which places her at risk for adhesions. Beginning in the second trimester, the gravid uterus can push on these adhesions and result in a bowel strangulation. Common symptoms of intestinal obstruction include colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis. Signs of a bowel obstruction include abdominal tenderness and decreased bowel sounds. Fever and an elevated white blood cell count are present with bowel strangulation and necrosis. This patient has a mild leukocytosis, which is also characteristic of normal pregnancy. In order to rule out an intestinal obstruction, an upright or lateral decubitus abdominal x-ray should be done to identify the presence of distended loops of bowel and air-fluid levels, which confirm the diagnosis. Treatment consists of bowel rest, intravenous hydration, and nasogastric suction; patients who do not respond to conservative therapy may require surgery. Bowel stimulants such as laxatives or enemas should not be administered. Pregnant women are predisposed to constipation secondary to decreased bowel motility induced by elevated levels of progesterone. The symptoms of nausea and emesis in this patient and the presence of a low-grade fever prompt further workup because her presentation is not consistent with uncomplicated constipation. In pregnancy, constipation can be treated with hydration, increased fiber in the diet, and the use of stool softeners. The patient's sudden onset of emesis and abdominal pain is not consistent with the normal presentation of hyperemesis gravidarum. Hyperemesis typically has an onset in the early part of the first trimester and usually resolves by 16 weeks. It is characterized by intractable vomiting causing severe weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. The ingestion of spicy foods during pregnancy can cause or exacerbate gastric reflux or 'heartburn' but would not cause the severity of the symptoms described in this patient's presentation. Dyspepsia during pregnancy can be treated with antacids. The patient with gastric reflux in pregnancy should also be counseled to eat smaller, more frequent meals and bland food.",D

Severe recurrent hypoglycemia associated with an inappropriate elevation of serum insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin defines this disorder.
The disorder later was called persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI); currently many authors prefer the term congenital hyperinsulinism (CI).
PHHI is the most common cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in neonates.


usually affects the infants and children. Adults can also be affected but at a much lower incidence.

Histopathology

Microscopically, pheochromocytomas are composed of polygonal to spindle-shaped chromaffin cells and their supporting cells, compartmentalized into small nests or 'Zellballen,' by a rich vascular network.
The cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells often has a finely granular appearance, highlighted by a variety of silver stains, because of the presence of granules containing catecholamines. Electron microscopy reveals variable numbers of membrane-bound, electron-dense granules, representing catecholamines and sometimes other peptides. The nuclei of the neoplastic cells are often quite pleomorphic.

Presentation

Most patients with PHHI present shortly after birth with symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g. hunger, jitteriness, lethargy, apnea, seizures). Older children, in addition to above symptoms, may also show diaphoresis, confusion, or unusual mood or behaviour changes.
The symptoms may be exacerbated by fasting and may improve after eating.

Immediate treatment of hypoglycemia is essential. Patients may require continuous IV glucose infusion. Glucagon may also be administered.
Other drugs used are diazoxide, octeride and nifedipine.
Surgical treatment is indicated if medical therapy does not maintain normoglycemia.",D

Endometrial Biopsy
• OPD procedure for hormonal evaluation in case of infertility / DUB/TB.
• Usually performed in pre–menstrual phase from the lateral wall of vagina.
• Interpretation:
Presence of secretory endometrium → Progesterone phase (cycles has been ovulatory)
Presence of proliferative endometrium → Estrogen phase (cycles has been anovulatory)
• Luteal phase defect can also be diagnosed by endometrial biopsy (which shows a lag of 2 – 3 days between calendar and histological dating of specimen.

"A 57-year-old woman presents to a physician with chronic pelvic pain of many years duration. On fuher questioning, the woman also repos urinary frequency, constipation, pain with intercourse and bloating. On physical examination, a large mass is felt in the pelvic area. Follow-up ultrasound examination demonstrates that the mass involves the right adnexa and is composed of multiloculated cystic spaces. Prior to sending the patient to surgery, the primary care physician wants to order a serum tumor marker to screen for ovarian cancer. Which of the following would be the best choice?",Adrenocoicotropic hormone,CA-125,Galactosyltransferase,S-100,"The diagnosis of ovarian cancer is often delayed, because symptoms often do not occur until late in the disease when the mass is large and applies pressure to other abdominal organs. The symptoms illustrated in the case are typical. Patients may also develop ascites with shoness of breath, a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms related to impaired motility secondary to pressure, and, if the ovarian cancer is a type that secretes hormones, menstrual irregularities or abnormal hair growth. The most widely studied tumor marker in ovarian cancer is CA-125. This marker is not of paicular use in screening of the general population for two reasons: 1) small cancers often do not cause serum elevations of the marker; and 2) serum levels of the marker can be elevated by a variety of cancers (including those of ovary, breast, pancreas, colon, and lung) and benign conditions (including endometriosis, pregnancy, liver disease, and congestive hea failure). However, if there is already a strong suspicion or a known history of ovarian cancer, CA-125 can be helpful in establishing if the cancer burden (if present) is large, and whether following the CA-125 levels following surgery can be used to monitor for recurrent disease. While small tumors are not always picked up (50% of women with small ovarian cancers have normal CA-125), more than 80% of women with advanced ovarian cancer have CA-125 elevations. Adrenocoicotropic hormone can be elevated in ectopic hormone-producing lung cancers. Galactosyltransferase can be elevated in a wide variety of cancers, including those from lung, breast, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and colon. It is not used as a marker for ovarian cancer. S-100 is a marker for melanoma and neuroendocrine tumors.",B

All are true about necrotizing enterocolitis except,Common among term infants,Delaying enteral feeding does not prevent NEC,Usually develops after the first week of life,Intestinal strictures may develop in survivors,"Necrotizing Enterocolitis Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) occurs among smaller premature infants, often those less than 32 weeks. The clinical picture mimics neonatal septicemia because of the presence of abdominal distension, apnea, bradycardia, instability of temperature, cyanosis and lethargy. NEC is believed to result from interaction of several factors such as gut immaturity, mucosal injury due to hypoxia-ischemia, milk feeding and infection. Antenatal steroids and breastfeeding protect against NEC. Delaying enteral feeding does not prevent NEC. The illness usually develops after the first week of life. The course may be very fulminant with death occurring in a few hours, moality rate being around 40-50%. Clinical manifestations may be described in three stages: Stage 1. Suspected NEC: Unstable temperature, apnea, bradycardia, lethargy, mild abdominal distension, vomiting. Frank or occult, blood may be present in stools. X-ray shows mild intestinal distension. Stage 2. Clinical signs as similar to stage 1. Bowel sounds are diminished with or without abdominal tenderness. Pneumatosis intestinalis (gas in intestinal wall) and dilatation of intestines are seen on abdominal X-ray. Stage 3. In addition to the above, the infant is severely sick with hemodynamic instability. There are frank signs of peritonitis with abdominal wall redness. Pneumoperitoneum may occur due to intestinal perforation. Management Oral feeding should be withheld. A nasogastric tube is inseed to relieve distension and to aspirate stomach contents. Fluids and electrolytes in adequate quantities should be administered. Parenteral nutrition may be administered. Shock is managed by replacement of fluids and the use of vasopressor agents. Sequelae Intestinal strictures may develop in survivors. These manifest with bloody stools, vomiting and abdominal distention. Shoened bowel leads to malabsorption. Ref: Paediatrics; O.P.

Cause of death in breech delivery :,Intracranial hemorrhage,Asphyxia,Atlanto axial dislocation,All,"Ans. is a, b and c i.e. Intracranial hemorrhage; Atlanto axial dislocation; and Asphyxia The risk of fetal moality and morbidity are greatly increased in the vaginal breech delivery Fetal moality is least in frank breech and maximum in footling presentation (as the chances of cord prolapse are more). Gynaecoid and anthropoid pelves are ourable for the after coming head. The fetal risk in multipara is no less than that of primigravida because of increased chances of cord prolapse associated with flexed breech which occurs in multipara. The main causes of increased perinatal moality and morbidity in breech are : Prematurity Increased incidence of Congenital anomalies. Bih asphyxia : -- Due to cord prolapse or cord compression. -- Due to prolonged delivery and delay in the after coming head. Bih trauma due to rough handling during delivery and failure to use the femoropelvic grip : Intracranial hemorrhage due to uncontrolled delivery of the head and rupture of the veins of Galen or tentorial or falx tears. Skull fractures can also occur. -- Fracture dislocation of cervical veebra, atlantoaxial dislocation and occipital diastasis. Cervical and brachial plexuses injuries, including Erb's palsy.

Postpartum VVF is best repaired after:,6 weeks,8 weeks,3 months,6 months,"Management of VVF is surgical management:
The timing of surgery -


Small urinary fistulas sometimes heal spontaneously during the first few weeks.


However, in a case of established fistula - it is better to wait for about 3 months° for all tissue inflammation to subside. If one attempt fails to heal fistula, the second attempt is done after 3 months.°


In fistulas following surgery, waiting period is 3-6 months.


In fistulas following radiation: 6 months - 2 years time can be taken before inflammation subsides.


Techniques of Repair -


Layer technique


Latzko procedure (for fistulas following hysterectomy)


Chassar Moir technique.


Post-operative Management -


Continuous bladder drainage for 14 days.


Antibiotic coverage.


No vaginal examination, P/S, intercourse x 3 months.


Avoid pregnancy for 2 years.


In pregnancy after repair of vaginal fistula - elective cesarean is done.


Extra Edge:
This question is an old one so here answer will be 3 months but if this question is repeated now remember the following lines from Williams Gynae. 1st /ed 575-576:
'Timing of repair: Traditional teaching recommends delayed repair of fistulas at 3 - 6 months after injury. However, this old dictum is probably no longer applicable. Most agree that unless there is a severe infection or acute signs of inflammation, waiting is not necessary. Early surgical intervention of uncomplicated fistulas does not affect closure rates, yet appears to reduce social and psychological patient distress (Balivas, 1995). Fistulas identified within the first 24 - 48 hours postoperatively can be safely repaired immediately with success rates of 90 - 100%.'",C

A 26-year old primigravida at 32 weeks of gestation experienced faintness and nausea in lying down and recovers after turning on her side or getting up. These symptoms can be attributed to which of the following?,Reduced placental flow,Increased intragastric pressure,Increased intracranial pressure,Interior vena caval compression,"Ans. d. Inferior vena caval compression (Ref: Dutta 6/e p53)Symptoms of faintness and nausea in lying down position and recovery after turning on the side or getting up in a 26-year old primigravida at 32 weeks of gestation can be attributed to inferior vena caval compression.'Supine hypotensive syndrome is caused when the inferior vena cava is compressed by the weight of a pregnant female uterus, fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid while lying in the supine position. The condition can develop as early as the second trimester but is maximum during the third trimester. The patient experiences reduced blood pressure signs of shock such as cool, moist and clammy skin, tachycardia (early sign), bradycardia (very late sign), dizziness, syncope or near syncope, pedal edema, nausea, decreased femoral pulse and signs of fetal distress. Supine hypotensive syndrome is easily managed by placing the patient in left lateral position.'Supine Hypotension Syndrome (Postural Hypotension)During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position.This, however, results in opening up of collateral circulation by means of paravertebral and azygous veins. In some cases (10%) when collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return to heart is seriously curtailed.This results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope.Turning patient to lateral position quickly restores the normal blood pressureQ.Can cause severe fetal distressThe augmentation of venous return during uterine contraction prevents the manifestation from developing during labourQ.",D

Hydrothorax develops secondary to flow of ascitic fluid into the pleural space via lymphatics of the diaphragm.* Ascites occurs (in 50% cases) when tumor size is >6cms.* Tumors producing Meig's syndrome manifest in the late childbearing period i.e., 30-40 years.* Both ascites and hydrothorax resolve spontaneously after removal of the tumor.Criteria for diagnosis of Meig's syndrome:* Tumor must be ovarian, solid and benign.* Both hydrothorax and ascites must be present.* Removal of the tumor must result in their spontaneous and permanent cure.Pseudomeig syndrome:* Can be seen in association with either benign or malignant tumor.* Hydrothorax could be a manifestation of pulmonary metastasis.* Syndrome can result from overstimulation of the ovaries with gonadotropins but, in such cases, the peritoneal exudate is more likely to be caused by an electrolyte imbalance rather than by ovarian tumor.",D

Which of the following maternal complication during pregnancy result in giving bih to a large baby?,Anaemia,Cardiac disease,Gestational diabetes,Gestational hypeension,"Maternal development of gestational diabetes result in fetal macrosomia. The pathophysiology of fetal macrosomia is not very clear but it seems clear that fetal hyperinsulinemia is one driving force. The insulin like growth factor, as well as fibroblast growth factor, also are involved, so a hyperinsulinemic state with increased levels of some growth factors, with increased expression of GLUT proteins in syncytiotrophoblast, may promote excessive fetal growth. It could also be due to elevated levels of maternal free fatty acid which leads to its increased transfer to the fetus accelerating triglyceride synthesis and resulting in adiposity.

The S2, S3, S4 innervation, if damaged at the level of the spinal cord, is most likely to produce incontinence of bladder or bowel. Pain of the vaginal delivery arises from stimuli from the lower genital tract. These are transmitted primarily through the pudendal nerve, the peripheral branches of which provide sensory innervation to the perineum, anus, vulva, and clitoris. The pudendal nerve passes beneath the sacrospinous ligament just as the ligament attaches to the ischial spine. Sensory nerve fibers of the pudendal nerve are derived from ventral branches of the S2 through S4 nerves.... So labour will be painful but the vaginal stretching and the episiotomy may not be.

35 year old mother of two children is suffering from amenorrhea from last 12 month. She has a history of failure lactation following second delivery but remained asymptomatic thereafter. Skull X-ray shows empty sella diagnosis is :,Menopause,Pituitary tumor,Sheehan's syndrome,Intraductal papilloma of breast,"Ans. is c i.e. Sheehan's Syndrome Friends, here before arriving to any diagnosis lets first see the causes of : Empty Sella : Congenital incompleteness of the sellar diaphragm. Presentation : Women present with : * Galactorrheadeg Features of hypogonadism : Men present with : * Impotence Loss of libido Infeility. In both sexes they can cause : Cavernous sinus syndrome consisting Raised serum prolactin levels X-Ray sella shows space occupying lesion. Investigations : In all cases of hyperprolactinemia : - MRI should be performed - TSH levels should be measured. Management : Microadenoma with no desire of feility : Asymptomatic patients with microadenomas rarely progress to macroadenomas managed conservatinely. If patient has osteopenia. (due to hypoestrogenemia caused by TProlactin levels) estrogen replacement or OCP's. Monitor patients with regular serial prolactin levels and MRI (every 12 months). 216 * Secondary to Surgery / Radiotherapy or infarction of pituitary tumor. * Secondary to Infarction and Necrosisof pituitary gland. Now from the given causes : either pituitary tumor or Sheehans syndrome can cause an empty sells on x Ray. Pituitary Tumours (Micro / Macro adenoma) cause galactorrhoea (not lactationat failure) with amenorrhea and are so, ruled out. - So, the ObVious answer me by exclusion is Sheehan's Syndrome. Sheehan's syndro: It is the syndrome which results from ischaemic necrosis of most of the Anterior Pituitarydeg due to spasm in its aerioles occurring at the time of severe hemorrhage or shock complicatingchildbih. Only the anterior pituitary is affected because in paurient woman, blood supply to the pituitary gland is modified to the advantage of the posterior lobe and disadvantage of the anterior lobe so, when spasm occurs, posterior lobe is protected. When 75% of Anterior pituitary is destroyed, manifestations of Sheehan's syndrome appear and when 95% is destroyed -- fully developed Simmonds syndrome is seen. Hormones of Anterior Pituitary are affected in order of frequency = GH, FSH and LH, TSH and ACTH.

Anatomical sphincter of fallopian tubes,Ampulla,Isthmus,Intramural,Infundibulum,"FALLOPIAN TUBES The two fallopian tubes are oviducts which extend from the ovaries to the cornua of the uterus, one on either side. Each lies in the free upper border of the broad ligament and, when straightened, is 10 cm in length. Its lumen communicates with the uterine cavity at its inner end and with the peritoneal cavity at its outer and thus provides the final section of an open or potentially open canal which leads from the exterior to the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tube is divided into four pas Interstitial or Intramural Pa This is only 1-2 cm in length and is the pa which traverses the uterine wall. It has a very narrow lumen (1 mm in diameter) and is different from the remainder of the tube in that it is without a peritoneal coat, and in that the outer longitudinal muscle has disappeared to cover the uterus. Isthmus This is the straight and narrow poion adjacent to the uterus and measures 2-3 cm. It has thick walls but the lumen is so narrow that it will only admit the finest probe (1-2 mm in diameter). Ampulla This is the wider, thin-walled and touous outer poion, approximately 5 cm in length, which leads to the infundibulum. Infundibulum This is the trumpet-shaped outer end with an opening into the peritoneal cavity (abdominal ostium). The latter is surrounded by fronds or fimbriae, one of which is longer than the others and is directed towards the ovary (fimbria ovarica). The fimbriated extremity is free of the broad ligament and curls back on itself so that its fimbriae aim to embrace the ovary like the tentacles of an octopus; this is impoant to feility. jeffcoate&;s principles of gynaceology;7th edition;pageno 29",C

"A boy with undescended testis, your concern to ask for operation is due to –a) Cosmetic reasonsb) Infertilityc) Risk of malignancyd) Impotence",a,c,ac,bc,"Let's see both options one by one.
1. Infertility

Infertility is a complication of undescended testis.
After treatment for a unilateral undescended testis, 85% of patients are fertile.
Following bilateral aorchidopexy 50-65% of patients are fertile.

2. Malignancy

Risk of developing germ cell tumors in an undescended testis is 4 to 5 times higher than that in general population.
The most common tumor developing is seminoma.
Whether orchidopexy reduces the risk of developing cancer of the testis is controversial, but it is uncommon for the testicular tumor to occur after orchidopexy performed before the age of 2 years.

All these features point towards severe preeclampsia. Now there is a lot of controversy regarding this question. Some feel cesarean section should be done while others feel induction of labor is the correct answer. Rest all believe anticonulsive therapy with MgSO4 is the option of choice. Putting an end to all the controversies. I am quoting text from the latest edition of High Risk Pregnancy
by Fernando Arias 3/e, p 420 – “If the gestational age is > 34 weeks the best approach is to treat with magnesium sulfate for the prevention of seizures, give antihypertensives to control the blood pressure and deliver by cesarean section or by induction of labor if the cervix is ripe.”
So this leaves no doubt that further line of management in this question is Anticonvulsive therapy. If the question would have been – best management then termination of pregnancy would have been the answer.",B

What is the treatment of choice of unrupturece tubal pergnancy with serum b-hCG titre 20001 U1 ml:,Single dose of methotrexate,Vairable dose of methotrexate,Expectant management,Laparoscopic salpingostomy,"Ans. is a i.e Single dose of methotrexate The lady in the question is presenting with unruptured ectopic pregnancy with BhCG levels - 2000IU/L. So there is not doubt we can manage the patient medically (i.e. option d - ruled out) Expectant management as explained earlier is not better than medical management as it carries the risk of rupture of ectopic pregnancy (i.e. option C ruled out) and also it is done when riFICG levels are < 1000 IUL Now - The question arises whether we should give single dose MTx or multidose methotrexate treatment. In the trials which have been conducted - No difference was found in treatment duration, phCG levels and side effects in single dose vs multidose methotrexate therapy. Single dose therapy is more commonly used becasue of simplicity. It is less expensive, requires less invasive post therapy monitoring and does not require leucovorin supplementation. One trial has shown that multidose therapy has greater chance of success than single dose but this is not suppoed by any other trial so, single dose methotrexate is being used commonly. (So, it is our option of choice.) Also know : Single dose Medical treatment protocol for ectopic pregnancy.

Stool investigation of a child who presented with anemia revealed worm infestation. Which of the following worm infestation is associated with iron deficiency anemia?,Whipworm,Hookworm,Roundworm,Pinworm,"The common human hookworms are Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. The larger A duodenale is more pathogenic because it consumes more blood, up to 0.5 mL per worm per day. The adult worms attach with their mouthpas to the mucosa, from which they suck blood. Blood loss is the major sequel of infection which leads to iron-deficiency anemia. Chronic hookworm infection is a common cause of moderate and severe hypochromic microcytic anemia, and heavy infection can cause hypoproteinemia with edema. Chronic hookworm infection in children may lead to growth delay, deficits in cognition, and developmental delay. Ref: Dominguez S.R., Levin M.J. (2012). Chapter 43. Infections: Parasitic & Mycotic.

No Cardiomegaly


First you should know the following facts : -


Pressure overload to ventricles causes concentric hypertrophy without dilatation.
Volume overload to ventricles causes hypertrophy with dilatation → Eccentric hypertrophy.


Due to pulmonary stenosis, there is pressure overload to right ventricle → Concentric hypertrophy of right ventricle without dilatation → No Cardiomegaly.

Spermatozoa deposited in female genital tract survive for 24 hours. The ovum may live for 12-24 hours so that intercourse between 11'h and 17' day may result in a pregnancy. The safe period is calculated from ls' day of the menstrual period until the 10th day of the cycle and from 18'h to 28' day. Or safe period can be calculated as shoest cycle minus () 18 gives first day of feile period and longest cycle minus (-) 10 gives last day of feile period An alternative method is to calculate the risk period, which is from 3 days before ovulation to 3 days after ovulation.

Likely diagnosis is :,XYY,Mullerian agenesis,Gonadal dysgenesis,Klinefelter syndrome,"Developmental defect of the Mullerian ducts resulting in the condition described as the Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRHK) syndrome. The MRHK syndrome occurs in 1:5000-1:20,000 women at bih, and is diagnosed in approximately 1:1500 gynaecologic admissions. The clinical features include primary amenorrhoea, paial or complete absence of vagina, a wide array of uterine abnormalities, skeletal/renal and other associated abnormalities, a normal female appearance and secondary sexual characteristics and a normal 46 XX karyotype. The ovaries are anatomically and functionally normal. These patients seek medical consultation because of primary amenorrhoea or in case of presence of functional uterus (1:10 cases)--because of cyclic abdominal pain occurring as a result of occult menstruation. Pelvic ultrasonography/MRI and laparoscopy help to establish the diagnosis. Mullerian duct agenesis may result in the uterus represented by a nodule (rudimentary uterus) with hypoplastic or dimple vagina. Reference: Shaw's Textbook of gynaecology,16th edition page no 132",B

Refer page no 223 of Text book of obsteics,sheila balakrishnan,2 nd edition. The ovarian tumour discovered during pregnancy is an enlarged corpus luteal cyst, a benign as well as a malignant tumour. An asymptomatic tumour is discovered during routine ultrasound scanning in early pregnancy. Symptomatic tumour however presents with abdominal pain in pregnancy. Corpus luteal cyst regresses after the 12th week and can therefore be observed. The benign tumour should be removed in the second trimester between the 14th and 16th week. Earlier surgery may increase the risk of aboion. In the third trimester surgical difficulty because of the growing uterus; preterm labour is also a possibility. The tumour discovered late in pregnancy should be removed in early puerperium to avoid torsion and infection. The malignant ovarian tumour requires laparotomy at the earliest, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy. Reference: Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology,16th edition page no 451",A

Which among the following is a manifestation of LCHAD deficiency?,Fatty liver of pregnancy,Liver failure,HELLP syndrome,All of the above,"Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency is an inherited metabolic disease caused by the impaired functionality of a paicular enzyme (long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, LCHAD). This enzyme deficiency makes it harder for the body to break down fatty acids. Signs and symptoms of LCHAD deficiency typically appear during infancy or early childhood and can include feeding difficulties, lethargy, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, liver problems, and abnormalities in the light-sensitive tissue at the retina. Later in childhood, people with this condition may experience muscle pain, breakdown of muscle tissue, and peripheral neuropathy. Individuals with LCHAD deficiency are also at risk for serious hea problems, breathing difficulties, coma, and sudden death. A woman who is heterozygous for LCHAD deficiency and whose fetus has the disorder can have unexpected and life-threatening acute fatty liver of pregnancy. HELLP Syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) may occur in pregnancies where a fetus is affected with LCHAD deficiency.",D

16 years old girl presents with rapid onset hirsutism and amenorrhea. Best investigation is :,Testosterone estimation,Dihydroepiandrosterone,Adrenocoicoids,LH and FSH estimation,"Ans. is a i.e. Testosterone estimation 'A variety of ovarian neoplasms, both benign and malignant may produce testosterone and lead to virilisation. Specifically, women with an abrupt onset, typically within several months, or sudden worsening of virilising signs should prompt concern for a hormone producing ovarian or adrenal tumor. Symptoms may include deepening of voice, frontal balding, severe acne or hirsutism or both, increased muscle mass and clitoromegaly. Accordingly, serum testosterone levels may be used to exclude these tumors. Free testosterone levels are more sensitive than total testosterone levels as an indicator of hyperandrogenism. Although improving, current free testosterone assays lack a uniform laboratory standard. For this reason. total testostrerone levels remain the best approach for excluding a tumor. Threshold values beyond 200 ng / dl of total testosterone warrant evaluation for an ovarian leison.' So now I do not need to explain that testosterone estimation is the best investigation in case of rapid onset hirsutism and amennorhea. Also know : Other investigations to be done in an Anovulatory hirsute female: -- Serum 170H progesterone levels (to rule out congenital adrenal hyperplasia). Serum TSH -- Serum Prolactin -- Insulin (as hyper insulinemia leads to hirsutism) -- 24 hour urinary free coisol excretion and evening plasma coisol level (to rule out cushing syndrome). -- LH/FSH ratio (for diagnosing PCOS).",A

Most common site for fibroids in uterus is:,Subserous,Intramural,Submucous,Cervical,"Ans: (b) Intramural Ref: Shaw s Textbook of Gynaecology 15th Edition Pg 352.Explanation:Uterine FibroidsFibroids are the most common benign solid tumours in femalesMost common tumour of uterus.Fibroids are estrogen dependent for growthProgesterone inhibits their growth.GnRH shrinks size of fibroidIncreases in size during pregnancy and OCP intakeDecreases in size after menopauseThe presence of myoma causes hyperplasia of the myometrial wall.The cavity of the uterus is often distorted and enlarged.The endometrium tends to be thicker due to endometrial hyperplasia.The ovaries at times are enlarged, cystic and hyperaemic with evidence of salpingo- oophoritis in about 15% cases.Distribution of fibroid in the body of uterus:Intramural 75%Submucus 15%Subserous 10%Most common site is body of uterusA typical myoma is a w ell-circumscribed tumour with a pseudocapsuleThe vessels which supply blood to the tumour lie in the capsule and send radial branches into the tumour. Because of this arrangement of blood supply, the central portion of the tumour receives the least blood supply, and degeneration is noticeable early and most often in this part of the tumour. On the other hand, calcification begins at the periphery and spreads inwards along the vessels.Microscopically, the tumour consists of bundles of plain muscle cells, separated by varying amount of fibrous strands. Areas of embryonic muscle tissue may be present in a myoma.The endometrium tends to be thicker due to endometrial hyperplasia. The ovaries at times are enlarged, cystic and hyperaemic with evidence of salpingo-oophoritis in about 15% cases.Points to be Remembered in FibroidMost common complication of fibroid during pregnancy- Red degenerationIncidence of sarcomatous change in fibroid - 0.5 %Most common presenting symptom is menorrhagiaMetrorrhagia is caused by - sub mucus fibroidMost common degeneration - Hyaline degeneration.Recurrent pregnancy loss is associated with submucous fibroidPolycythemia in myoma is due to extramedullary erythropoisis within the substance of myomaDanazole.

A very low bih weight preterm baby is on ventilator for respiratory distress. Baby presents with clinical features of necrotizing enterocolitis with perforation. What will be the appropriate management?,Conservative management,Immediate laparotomy,Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation with surgery after stabilization,Peritoneal drainage,"Surgical intervention is the most definitive treatment of perforated necrotising enterocolitis. However the patient mentioned in the above question is premature with very low bih weight. Such critically ill preterm babies are extremely unstable for surgery and are unlikely to tolerate major resective procedure. Peritoneal drainage will deflate the distended abdomen, allow better movement of diaphragm and improve respiration. Removal of feculent fluid would also reduce chances of sepsis syndrome.

Regarding IUGR,Abdominal circumference (AC) is the least sensitive parameter for detection of IUGR,In asymmetric IUGR head circumference/abdominal circumference (HC/AC) is reduced,Serial biparietal diameter (BPD) is the only important measurement in IUGR,AC indirectly reflects fetal liver size and glycogen storage,"‘AC is the single most sensitive parameter to detect IUGR’
Dutta Obs 7/e, p 462
‘Serial measurements of AC (not BPD) and estimation of fetal weight are more diagnostic to fetal growth restriction’
Dutta Obs 7/e, p 462
Head circumference (HC) and abdominal circumference (AC) ratios: In a normally growing fetus the HC/AC ratio exceeds 1.0 before 32 weeks. It is approximately 1.0 at 32 to 34 weeks. After 34 weeks, it falls below 1.0. If the fetus is affected by asymmetric IUGR, the HC remains larger. The HC/AC is then elevated. In symmetric IUGR, both the HC and AC are reduced. The HC/AC ratio remains normal. Using HC/AC ratio, 85% of IUGR fetuses are detected
Pathophysiology: Basic pathology in small for gestational age is due to reduced availability of nutrients in the mother or its reduced transfer by the placenta to the fetus. It may also be due to reduced ultilization by the fetus. Brain cell size (asymmetric–SGA) as well as cell numbers (symmetric-SGA) are reduced. Liver glycogen content is reduced. AC indirectly reflects the decreased fetal liver size and glycogen content.",D

Among the T-cell diseases is DiGeorge anomaly, in which defective embryologic development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches results in hypoplasia of both thymus and parathyroid glands. Associated findings with DiGeorge anomaly include CATCH: C for cardiac, A for abnormal faces, T for thymic hypoplasia, C for cleft palate, and H for hypocalcemia.Primary B-cell diseases include X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA, or Bruton disease), a deficiency of all three major classes of immunoglobulins, as well as other selective deficiencies of the immunoglobulins or their subgroups. This condition usually presents after 3 months of age (after maternal antibodies wane) with recurrent and often simultaneous bouts of otitis media, pneumonia, diarrhea, and sinusitis, but usually without fungal and viral infections. Combined T- and B-cell diseases include the X-linked recessive Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome of mild T-cell dysfunction, diminished serum IgM, marked elevation of IgA and IgE, eczema, recurrent middle-ear infections, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Patients with the catastrophic combined T- and B-cell disease known as severe combined immunodeficiency disease (Swiss-type lymphopenic agammaglobulinemia or SCID), have deficient T and B cells. Consequently, they have lymphopenia and agammaglobulinemia, as well as thymic hypoplasia. Chronic diarrhea; rashes; recurrent, serious bacterial, fungal, or viral infections; wasting; and early death are characteristic.

"At bih, oocytes are in which stage of development:",Prophase of 1st meiotic division,Oogonia,Telophase of 2nd meiotic division,Resting phase between prophase and metaphase of 1st meiotic division,"Ans:D.)Resting phase between prophase and metaphase of 1st meiotic division. OOGENESIS The process involved in the development of a mature ovum is called oogenesis. The primitive germ cells take their origin from the yolk sac at about the end of 3rd week and their migration to the developing gonadal ridge is completed round about the end of 4th week. In the female gonads, the germ cells undergo a number of rapid mitotic divisions and differentiate into oogonia. The number of oogonia reaches its maximum at 20th week, numbering about 7 million. While the majority of the oogonia continue to divide, some enter into the prophase of the first meiotic division and are called primary oocytes. These are surrounded by flat cells and are called primordial follicles and are present in the coex of the ovary. At bih, there is no more mitotic division and all the oogonia are replaced by primary oocytes which have finished the prophase of the first meiotic division and remain in resting phase (dictyotene stage) between prophase and metaphase. Total number of primary oocytes at bih is estimated to be about 2 million. The primary oocytes do not finish the first meiotic division until pubey is reached. At pubey, some 400,000 primary oocytes are left behind, the rest being atretic. Out of these, some 400 are likely to ovulate during the entire reproductive period.",D

"About 12 days after a mild upper respiratory infection, a 12-year-old boy complains of weakness in his lower extremities. Over several days, the weakness progresses to include his trunk. On physical examination, he has the weakness described and no lower extremity deep tendon reflexes, muscle atrophy, or pain. Spinal fluid studies are notable for elevated protein only. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Bell palsy,Muscular dystrophy,Guillain-Barre syndrome,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,"The paralysis of Guillain-Barre often occurs about 10 days after a nonspecific viral illness. Weakness is gradual over days or weeks, beginning in the lower extremities and progressing toward the trunk. Later, the upper limbs and the bulbar muscles can become involved. Involvement of the respiratory muscles is life-threatening. The syndrome seems to be caused by a demyelination in the motor nerves and, occasionally, the sensory nerves. Measurement of spinal fluid protein is helpful in the diagnosis; protein levels are increased to more than twice normal, while glucose and cell counts are normal. Hospitalization for observation is indicated. Treatment can consist of observation alone, intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, or plasma-pheresis. Recovery is not always complete. Bell palsy usually follows a mild upper respiratory infection, resulting in the rapid development of weakness of the entire side of the face. Muscular dystrophy encompasses a number of entities that include weakness over months. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease has a clinical onset including peroneal and intrinsic foot muscle atrophy, later extending to the intrinsic hand muscles and proximal legs.

Among the important causes of neonatal sepsis are prenatal infections, including congenital syphilis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus infection, and rubella. Useful diagnostic studies, in addition to cultures for bacteria, include specific serologic tests for pathogens, viral cultures, lumbar puncture, and x-rays of the chest and long bones. Longitudinal striations in the metaphysis are characteristic of congenital rubella, whereas osteochondritis or periostitis usually indicates congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and rubella can be highly contagious. Urine can contain rubella virus for more than 6 months and is, therefore, a special hazard to nonimmune pregnant women.",B

All of the following are true about regional blood flow in pregnancy except :,Uterine blood flow at term is 750 ml/min,Blood flow through skin decreases,Renal blood flow increases by 50%,Pulmonary blood flow increase,"REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD FLOW: Uterine blood flow is increased from 50 mL/min in non-pregnant state to about 750 mL near term. The increase is due to the combined effect of uteroplacental and fetoplacental vasodilatation. The vasodilatation is due to the smooth muscle relaxing effects of progesterone, estrogen, nitric oxide (endothelium derived factor), prostaglandins and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In a normal pregnancy, vascular system becomes refractory to angiotensin II, endothelin I and other pressure agents. Pulmonary blood flow (normal 6000 mL/min) is increased by 2500 mL/min. Renal blood flow (normal 800 mL) increases by 400 mL/min at 16th week and remains at this level till term. The blood flow through the skin and mucous membranes reaches a maximum of 500 mL/min by 36th week. Heat sensation, sweating or stuffy nose in pregnant woman is thus explained.

Supine hypotension is a characteristic feature of:,First trimester of pregnancy,2nd trimester of pregnancy,3rd trimester of pregnancy,Twin pregnancy,"Supine Hypotension syndrome: During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position. This however results in the opening up of the collateral circulation by means of paraveebral and azygos veins. In some cases when collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return to the hea may be seriously cuailed. This results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope. Note: The normal blood pressure is quickly restored by turning the patient to lateral position. The augmentation of the venous return during uterine contraction prevents the manifestation from developing during labour. Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics D.C.Dutta 6th Ed Page 53.",C
Most common twin after assisted reproduction is,Acardiac twin,Monozygotic twin,Dizygotic twin,Conjoined twin,"(C) Dizygotic twin[?]Prevalence of Dizygotic twins is related to:Race: The frequency is highest amongst Negroes, lowest amongst Mongols & intermediate amongst Caucasians.Hereditary: There is hereditary predisposition likely to be more transmitted through the female (maternal side).Advancing age of the mother: Increased incidence of twinning is observed with the advancing age of the mother, the maximum being between the age of 30-35 years. The incidence of twins is markedly reduced thereafter.Influence of parity: The incidence is increased with increasing parity specially from 5th gravida onwards.Iatrogenic: Drugs used for induction of ovulation may produce multiple fetuses to the extent of 20-40% following gonadotrophin therapy, although to a lesser extent (5-6%) following clomiphene citrate.Dizygotic twins:There are two placentae, either completely separated or more commonly fused at the margin appearing to be one (9 out of 10). There is no anastomosis between the two fetal vessels.Each fetus is surrounded by a separate amnion & chorion.As such, intervening membranes consist of 4 layers - amnion, chorion, chorion & amnion. In fact in early pregnancy the decidua capsularis of each sac may be identified under the microscope in between the chorionic layers. Other Options[?]Monozygotic twins:The placenta is single. There is varying degree of free anastomosis between the two fetal vessels.Each fetus is surrounded by a separate amniotic sac with the chorionic layer common to both (Diamniotic-monochorionic).As such the intervening membranes consist of two layers of amnion only. However, on rare occasions, the uniovular twins may be diamniotic-dichorionic or mono-amniotic-monochorionic.[?]Fetus acardiacus:It occurs only in monozygotic twins.

"In long protocol IVF, GnRH agonist is staed on",Day 1 of previous cycle,Day 21 of previous cycle,Day 1 of IVF cycle,Day 21 of IVF cycle,"Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonist ProtocolsIn the long protocol, a GnRH agonist is staed in the luteal phase (day 21) of the previous cycle. This diminishes the GnRH agonists flare effect and suppresses endogenous FSH and dominant follicle selection to promote synchronous follicular growth. After 10 to 14 days of GnRH agonist administration, a pelvic ultrasound and estradiol level are used to confirm suppression and gonadotropin stimulation begins. The GnRH agonist is continued (the dose may be halved or unchanged) throughout the cycle until the hCG trigger.The long protocol provides for better oocyte yields and pregnancy rates in normal responders when compared with shoer protocols that use later administration or early cessation of agonists. GnRH microdose flare protocols have been developed that may improve oocyte yield in poor responders. Microdose flare regimens involve pretreatment with 14 to 21 days of combination oral contraceptives.Four days following the cessation of the oral contraceptive pills, a microdose (leuprolide 25 mg) of agonist is added in the early follicular phase to take advantage of the agonist flare effect. Gonadotropin stimulation is initiated 1 to 2 days later while continuing the agonist.Reference: Novak's Gynecology; 14th edition; Chapter 32; Infeility and Assisted Reproductive Technology",B

Thus at a critical time in male sexual differentiation, hCG enters fetal plasma from the syncytiotrophoblast. In the fetus, it acts as an LH surrogate to stimulate Leydig cell replication and testosterone synthesis to promote male sexual differentiation. Before approximately 110 days, there is no vascularization of the fetal anterior pituitary from the hypothalamus. Thus, pituitary LH secretion is minimal,and hCG acts as LH before this time. Thereafter as hCG levels fall, pituitary LH maintains modest testicular stimulation.c) Immunosuppressive activity, inhibits maternal processes of immunorejection of the fetus as a homograft.d) Stimulates maternal thyroid (thyrotropic action).e) Promotes relaxin secretion from corpus luteum.o Choriocarcinoma is associated with increased secretion of beta - hCG that is glycosylated to a greater degree, so called hyperglycosylated hCG, sometimes called invasive trophoblast antigen.",B

Approximately 30 min ago she noted bright red blood coming from her vagina. By the time she arrives at the delivery floor, she is contracting strongly every 3 min; the uterus is quite firm even between contractions. By abdominal palpation, the fetus is vertex with the head deeply engaged. Fetal heart rate is 130/min. The fundus is 38 cm above the symphysis. Blood for clotting is drawn, and a clot forms in 4 min. Clotting studies are sent to the laboratory. Which of the following actions can wait until the patient is stabilized?",Stabilizing maternal circulation,Attaching a fetal electronic monitor,Inserting an intrauterine pressure catheter,Administering oxytocin,"The patient described in the question presents with a classic history for abruption-that is, the sudden onset of abdominal pain accompanied by bleeding. Physical examination reveals a firm, tender uterus with frequent contractions, which confirms the diagnosis. The fact that a clot forms within 4 min suggests that coagulopathy is not present. Because abruption is often accompanied by hemorrhaging, it is important that appropriate fluids (i.e., lactated Ringer solution and whole blood) be administered immediately to stabilize the mother's circulation. Cesarean section may be necessary in the case of a severe abruption, but only when fetal distress is evident or delivery is unlikely to be accomplished vaginally Internal monitoring equipment should provide an early warning that the fetus is compromised. The internal uterine catheter provides pressure recordings, which are important if oxytocin stimulation is necessary. Generally, however, patients with abruptio placentae are contracting vigorously and do not need oxytocin.",D

"Preterm baby with PDA, which is the least idly findings?",CO2 washout,Bounding pulses,Pulmonary hemorrhage,Necrotising enterocolitis,"PDA in preterm neonate

In previous explanations I have explained that chances of spontaneous closure of PDA are higher in premature infants as there is no structural abnormality. However, you should keep in mind that this fact is true when we are comparing the spontaneous closure of PDA between term and pre-term neonate. Overall, the percentage of spontaneous closure of PDA in preterm neonate is very low. To avoid confusion, I am explaining following facts in brief :-



Normal neonate :- Ductus arteriosus closes functionally within about 15 hours of birth.
FDA in term (mature) neonate :- The persistence of ductus arteriosus beyond 24 hours after birth is considered as PDA in term neonate. Spontaneous closure of PDA does not usually occur because PDA results from structural abnormality.
FDA in pre-term (pre-mature) neonate :- The ductus arteriosus in pre-term neonate is not as responsive to increased oxygen content as it is in term neonate. However, there is no structural abnormality.


Chances of spontaneous closure are very less (compared to normal term neonate).
Chances of spontaneous closure are more than the term-neonate with PDA. However, in premature neonate, where hypoxic pulmonary disease is common place, the ductus being sensitive to hypoxia, remains open.


So, it is very unlikely that spontaneous closure of PDA will occur in pre-term neonate. But chances are more when compared to term neonate with PDA (not nonnal term neonate in which ductus arteriosus closes within 15 hours of birth).

Manifestations of PDA in pre-term neonate

Apnea for unexplained reasons in an infant recovering from RDS;
A hyperdynamic precordium, bounding peripheral pulses, wide pulse pressure, and a continuous or systolic murmur with or without extension into diastole or an apical diastolic murmur, multiple clicks resembling the shaking of dice;
Carbon 'oxide retention;
Increasing oxygen dependence;
X-ray evidence of cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings; and
Hepatomegaly


Increased pulmonary blood flow and compromised ventricular function accompanying dropping pulmonary resistance in the setting of a P A is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hemorrhage.
The greatest risk factor for NEC is prematurity. Any etiology which leads on to hemodynamic or hypoxic insult predisposes to NEC. PDA is common in preteen infants and it definitely causes hemodynamic stress and is a risk factor for development of NEC.",A

Test for ovarian reserve:,LH,LH/FSH ratio,FSH,Estradiol,"Ans. c. FSH /Ref Harrison 19e p2388, 18/e p17/e p2331]Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce egg. The methods for assessing ovarian reserve are classified into Passive testing and Dynamic testing. FSH level is a method for testing passive ovarian reserve.'As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. Rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompanied by a decline in oocyte quality. High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy.'Ovarian reserve* Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce egg* During the first few days of each monthly cycle, under the influence of FSH and LH there is rapid growth of several follicles in the ovaiy. After a week or more of growth one of the follicles begin to outgrow. AH the others and the remaining follicles involute (a process called atresia), and these follicles are said to become atretic.* The process of atresia is important because it normally allow s only one of the follicles to grow large enough, each month to ovulate. This usually prevents more than one child from developing with each pregnancy.* The single follicle reaches a diameter of l-l .5 centimeters at the time of ovulation and is called the mature follicle.* With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce eggs declines.Methods of assessing ovarian reserve:* With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce egg declines i.e. ovarian reserve decrease with age.* Usually age is the best predictor of ovarian reserve but approximately 10% of women have an accelerated loss of ovarian reserve by their mid-30. So age alone does not tell the whole story. Consequently more refined methods for predicting ovrian reserve have been developed.* Goal of methods for assessing ovarian reserve is to provide information regarding oocyte quality and quantity.Methods for Assessing Ovarian ReservePassive testingDynamic testingFSH level:* Early folloicular phase FSH levels play an important role in pregnancy outcomes.* As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. Rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompanied by a decline in oocyte quality.* High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy.Measurement of Inhibin B:* Inhibin B is an ovarian hormone that inhibits FSH release. Although present in ovulating women it is not normally found in postmenopausal women.* Low inhibin levels suggests poor ovarian reserve.Transvaginal ultrasound:* Diminshed ovarian reserve means that fewer follicles are available for stimulation and recruitment by fertility drugs.* Transvaginal ultrasound allows the observation of ovaries and assess the number of follicles (ovarian volume.)Ciomiphene citrate challenge test:* Clomiphene is an antiestrogen which inhibits the negative feedback of estrogen on hypothalamus i.e. the hypothalamus gets false signals that the patient does not have enough estrogen. In response, the hypothalamus induces the pituitary gland to produce more FSH and LH. This is turn initiates follicular growth to produce estrogen.* Clomiphene is able to exert this effect only when the estrogen level is low or the ovarian reserve is low.* In a normal woman with adequate ovarian reserve there is enough inhibin and estrogen to suppress FSH production through negative feedback and resist the effects clomiphene.* When undergoing clomiphene citrate challenge test. the first step is to measure day 3 FSH and estrogen. Then 100 mg of clomiphere is administered on cycle day 5 through 9 and FSH and estrogen measurement are repeated on cycle day 10.* In general, a high day 10 FSH suggests poor ovarian reserve.",C

A plain radiograph of the abdomen demonstrates gas within the bowel wall (pneumatosis). Which of the following would MOST likely be associated with this finding?,Air in the biliary tract,BIood in the biliary tract,Gas in the hepatic veins,Gas in the poal vein,"Poal venous gas is seen in association with pneumatosis intestinalis, most commonly with necrotizing enterocolitis. The physiology of this is that the poal vein, the mesenteric veins, drains nutrient-rich blood from the gut to the liver. In the case of necrosis with air in the bowel wall, air migrates into the poal venous system and to the liver. On CT, this has the characteristic appearance of peripheral lucencies following the poal venous system intrahepatically. In cases of more severe pneumatosis, the bowel may rupture and lead to pneumoperitoneum. Also Know: Pneumobilia, or air in the biliary tract, would be seen after instrumentation of the biliary system, such as after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP). Other causes include a gas-forming infection within the biliary tree or previous sphincterotomy (endoscopic opening of the sphincter of Oddi). Pneumobilia has a distinct appearance on CT: there is gas located centrally in the liver within the ducts. Hemobilia, or blood in the biliary tract, would be seen after instrumentation of the biliary system, such as after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP), from a biliary or hepatic tumor, or secondary to a hypocoagulable state. Hemobilia is found at endoscopy, and is generally not visible on plain radiographs. High attenuation material may be seen within the bile ducts on a CT scan, suggesting hemobilia. Hepatic venous gas would not be seen with pneumatosis because the hepatic veins drain the liver into the inferior vena cava (IVC). Gas from the bowel wall gets trapped in the poal veins and does not traverse the liver to get into the hepatic veins. Ref: Thilo E.H., Rosenberg A.A. (2012). Chapter 2. The Newborn Infant. In W.W.

Sulfonamides are associated with kernicterus in the newborn. They compete with bilirubin for binding sites on albumin, thereby leaving more bilirubin free for diffusion into tissues. Sulfonamides should be withheld during the last 2 to 6 weeks of pregnancy. With prolonged treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in pregnancy, streptomycin has been associated with fetal hearing loss. Its use is restricted to complicated cases of TB. Nitrofurantoin can cause maternal and fetal hemolytic anemia if glucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is present. Chloramphenicol is noted for causing the gray baby syndrome.

Which of the following is not a feature of Phenylketonuria?,Severe mental retardation,Reduced tendon reflexes,Hypopigmentation in skin,Hair loss,"Ans. B. Reduced tendon reflexesPhenylketonuria (PKU), is caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism. The results of a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) impairs the body's ability to metabolize the essential amino acid phenylalanine. This leads to accumulation of phenylalanine in body fluids. Elevated phenylalanine levels negatively impact cognitive function, and individuals with classic PKU almost always have intellectual disability unless levels are controlled through dietary or pharmacologic treatment. Fair skin and hair resulting from impairment of melanin synthesis, is the most characteristic cutaneous manifestation of PKU . Other manifestations include eczema (including atopic dermatitis), Light sensitivity, Increased incidence of pyogenic infections, Increased incidence of keratosis pilaris, Decreased number of pigmented nevi, Scleroderma like plaques and hair loss Other manifestations include intellectual disability, mousy odour, epilepsy, extrapyramidal symptoms and eye abnormalities.",B

Late diagnosis and care is associated with 4-fold increase in obstetric morbidity and 9-fold increase in preterm labor.* Poor nutritional states, hypoproteinemia, anemia and associated medical conditions add to maternal morbidity and mortality.* True congenital TB is believed to be rare. A fetus can get TB infection either by hematogenous spread through umbilical vein or by ingestion or aspiration of infected amniotic fluid. The risk to neonate of getting TB infection shortly after birth is greater.* ATT should be started as soon as possible, as untreated disease is a hazard to the mother and fetus.* The regimens recommended for use in pregnancy are same as for the nonpregnant state except for withholding of streptomycin. Currently, an intermittent regimen (thrice weekly on alternate days) under the DOTS strategyof RNTCP is being increasingly used worldwide for pregnant women having TB.* None of the AKT drugs are teratogenic and AKT should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made.

Lowest recurrence in nocturnal enuresis is seen with-,Bed alarms,Desmopressin,Imipramine,Oxybutynin,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Bed alarms Enuresis Enuresis is defined as the voluntary or involuntary repeated discharge of urine into clothes or bed after a developmental age when bladder control should be established (mostly mental age of 5 years). o Diagosis of enuresis requires voiding of urine twice a week for 3 consecutive months or clinically significant distress in child's life as a result of wetting. o Most common cause of diurnal enuresis is micturition deferral (waiting until the last minute to void). Treatment o First line treatment for enuresis is behavioral therapy. It consists of rewarding the child for being dry at night, child should void before retiring and the use of conditioning devices (e.g. bed alarm that rings when the child wets a special sheet). o Consistent dry bed training with positive reinforcement has a success rate of 85% and bed and pad alarm systems have a success rate of approximately 75% with relapse rate that are lower than those with pharmacotherapy. o Pharmacotherapy is second line treatment and should be reserved for those patients who have failed behavioural therapy. Imipramine and desmopressin are two impoant drugs useful for enuresis. o Fast action of desmopressin (orally or intranasaly) suggests a role for special occass ons when rapid control of enuresis is required. However, recurrence rate is very high. o Imipramine is associated with cardiac conduction disturbances and is deadly in overdose.",A

Which chromosome is involved in Angelman syndrome?,chr 13,chr 15,chr 18,chr 21,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., chr 15 Genomic imprinting* A person inherits two copies of their genes, one from mother and one from father. Usually both allels of gene are active in cells. However, in some cases, one of the allel (either maternal or paternal) is silenced and only the counterpart remains active.* When the allel inherited from mother is silenced/inactivated (paternal allel is active), it is called maternal genomic imprinting. When paternal allel is silenced (maternal allel is active) it is called paternal genomic imprinting.* Thus genomic imprinting leads to preferential expression of an allel depending on its parental origin.* Important examples of genomic imprinting are1) Prader Willi syndrome# It is due to paternal genomic imprinting in which there is deletion on paternal chromosome 15.# They are characterized by hypotonia, obesity, short stature, mental retardation, hypogonadism, hyperphagia, and short hand and feet.# There is decrease in GnRH, LH, FSH and GH.

To do so, he or she will perform a test called a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test. In this test, the doctor will take a blood sample, and then give your child a shot containing the GnRH hormone. More blood samples are then taken over a ceain period of time to check how hormones in your child&;s body react. In children with central precocious pubey, the GnRH hormone will cause other hormone levels to rise. In children with peripheral precocious pubey, other hormone levels stay the same. Additional testing for central precocious pubey Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A brain MRI is usually done for children who have central precocious pubey to see if any brain abnormalities are causing the early sta of pubey. Thyroid testing. The doctor may also test your child&;s thyroid if he or she shows any signs of slow thyroid function (hypothyroidism), such as fatigue, sluggishness, increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, a drop in school performance or pale, dry skin. Additional testing for peripheral precocious pubey Other tests also are necessary for children with peripheral precocious pubey to find the cause of their condition. For example, the doctor may run additional blood tests to check other hormone levels or, in girls, he or she may do an ultrasound to check for an ovarian cyst or tumor.

But if we weigh CA-125 level in terms of significance then it is least significant in tuberculosis as it is neither used for diagnosis nor for follow-up in tuberculosis. Palpable mass may be present in all the four conditions. Infeility is a feature of both endometriosis and tuberculosis. But for ovarian cancers infeility is a risk factor, not a feature or presenting symptom. Coming to Age: Patient is 35 yrs old. Age of 35 yrs ours endometrioma most. Peak incidence of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (most common ovarian cancer) is at 56-60 yrs of age and for border line tumor average age is 46 yrs approximately (Novak). Patients with tuberculosis are in their twenties commonly, the maximum age incidence at diagnosis being 28 yrs. So on the basis of age and infeility, the most probable diagnosis would be endometrioma",B

"A 7 year old child is brought to the pediatrician because of increased thirst and bed-wetting. Despite an increased appetite, she has lost 5 pounds over the past month. A dipstick test of a urine sample reveals the presence of glucose. A blood sample drawn from this patient is most likely to exhibit which of the following compared to that of a normal individual?",Increased concentration of C-peptide,Decreased concentration of hemoglobin A1c,Decreased osmolarity,Increased antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD),"A child with glycosuria, polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss despite increased appetite is likely to have type 1 diabetes mellitus. This form of diabetes has an impoant autoimmune component to its etiology. As many as 85% of patients have islet cell autoantibodies in their blood in the first few weeks after onset of the disease. Most of these antibodies are directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme that is present in b cells. Insulin deficiency leads to decreased glucose uptake and hyperglycemia. The increase in blood glucose results in increased glycosylation of hemoglobin in red blood cells. Hence, the hemoglobin A1c concentration will be increased, not decreased, reflecting long-standing hyperglycemia. Another consequence of the increased blood glucose is increased serum osmolarity (not decreased). If the osmolarity exceeds 330 mOsm/L, consciousness begins to be impaired.beta; cell destruction in type 1 diabetes leads to decreased secretion of insulin. Since insulin and C-peptide are released on a 1:1 ratio by the beta; cells, the secretion of C-peptide is also decreased . Insulin is first synthesized as preproinsulin, with an initial leader sequence of hydrophobic amino acids that allows the developing protein to be extruded from the ribosomes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The 'pre' segment is then cleaved off, leaving proinsulin. Proinsulin is packaged into secretory granules within the Golgi, and as the granules bud off, enzymes cleave the precursor into insulin and C-peptide. Ref: Klein U. (2012). Chapter 17.

Drug of choice in chronically hypeensive pregnant women requiring long term antihypeensive therapy: September 2007,Nifedipine,Metaprolol,Methyldopa,Hydralazine,"Ans. C: Methyldopa Methyldopa is a drug of first choice for control of mild to moderate hypeension in pregnancy and is the most widely prescribed antihypeensive for this indication. During long term use in pregnancy, methyldopa does not alter maternal cardiac output or blood flow to the uterus or kidneys, and for all these reasons it is generally considered the agent of choice for chronic blood pressure control in pregnancy. Because the safety record of labetalol in pregnancy is not as well established as that of methyldopa, labetalol should probably be considered a second-line agent for pregnant women with chronic hypeension requiring long term drug therapy",C

Hypematremia is defined as Na+ Concentration > 150 meq/L.
Most children with hypematremia are dehydrated and show typical clinical signs and symptoms.
Children with hypernatremic dehydration tend to have better preservation of intravascular volume because of the shift of water from the intracellular to extracellular space.
This maintain blood pressure and urine output, and allows hypernatremic infant to be less symptomatic initially and potentially to become more dehydrated before medical attention is sought.
Probably because of intracellular water loss, the pinched abdominal skin of a hypematremic dehydrated infant has a 'doughy' feel.
Hyperntremia causes CNS symptoms due to neuronal shrinkage (water shifts out of the cell) : -

❑ Lethargy                ❑ Irritability                                        ❑ Restlessness ❑ Weakness             ❑ High pitched cry and hyperpnea
❑ Nausea  ❑ Fever

Hypematremia is associated with hypoglycemia and mild hypocalcemnia.
Brain hemorrhage is the most devastating consequence of hypernatremia --> may be subarachnoid, subdural or meningeal.

"During childbih, which of the following muscles is most often injured by a tear of the perineum?",Coccygeus,Iliococcygeus,Pubococcygeus,Puborectalis,"The fetal head is suppoed during childbih by the pelvic floor. If injury occurs during the passage of the child through the dilated uterine cervix, this injury most frequently involves a tear of the perineum between the vagina and anus. This tear usually involves the pubococcygeus, which is the main pa of the levator ani. The pubococcygeus runs from the pubic bone anteriorly to the coccyx posteriorly, and contains an anterior opening for the urethra and vagina and a posterior opening for the rectum. Tears to this muscle that heal poorly may consequently predispose for uterine prolapse, cystocele, and rectocele. The coccygeus is a relatively small muscle of the pelvic floor that runs from the ischial spine to the inferior end of the sacrum. The iliococcygeus is another pa of the levator ani, and runs from the iliac bone to the coccyx, forming pa of the more lateral aspects of the pelvic floor. The puborectalis is the third pa of the levator ani, and runs from pubic bone to pubic bone, forming a sling-like structure around the wall of the anal canal Ref: Lippincott's Illustrated Q&A Review of Anatomy and Embryology - Page 85",C

For antenatal fetal monitoring in a diabetic pregnancy all of the following are useful except:,Non-stress test,Biophysical profile,Doppler flow study,Fetal kick count,"Fetal surveillance in gestational diabetes:
“Low risk gestational diabetic patiens who achieve adequate control with diet alone and do not develop macrosomia, polyhydramnios or preeclampsia do not requre antepartum fetal surveillance testing before 40 weeks. In fact, the risk of fetal distress in those patients is as low as in non diabetics and fetal well being can be assessed by teaching the patients about fetal movements and asking them to fill up a chart for kick counts. On the other hand, high risk gestational diabetics and patients on glyburide and/or insulin should have antepartum fetal surveillance testing starting at 32-34 weeks of gestation. There is no conscensus as to what is the best test for these patients.
Weekly or twice weekly NST are the most popular. However biophysical profile (BPP) the modified biophysical profile and CST are also used.”
Fernando Arias 3/e, p 449
According to COGDT 10/e, p 315
“Surveillance for fetal well being often begins at 32 weeks gestation in patients with end organ disease using a twice weekly NST or modified BPP done twice weekly by measuring the fetal heart rate an the amniotic fluid volume. A weekly BPP is similarly useful. Women without end organ disease who requrie insulin often begin fetal monitoring at 32-34 weeks. Women with diet controlled gestational diabetes usually begin testing at 36-40 weeks until delivered. Maternal fetal movement monitoring check count using a count to 10 or similar method is recommended for all pregnant
women, including those with diabetes to reduce the stillbirth rate.
COGDT 10/e, p 315
So from above 2 texts it is very clear that:

Fetal kick count
NST – Non stress test
CST – Contraction stress test
BPP – Biophysical score/profile

are done for anteratal fetal surveillance in diabetes.
As far as Doppler is concerned “The current evidence suggests the use of Doppler flow studies in patients with diabetes mellitus who have pregnancies complicated by hypertensive disease, fetal growth restriction or vasculopathy. It is not recommended as a routine method of fetal surveillance”.

When the blood vessels in the skin get inflamed, they can bleed, causing a rash that is called Purpura. This rash is typically seen on the lower legs or arms. The specific skin lesion is characterized by the tissue deposition of an immune system product, called IgA immunoglobulin, which is also found in kidneysof patients with a renal disease, called IgA nephropathy.HSP occurs more often in children than in adults, and many cases follow an upper respiratory tract infection (infection in your sinuses and /or lungs). Halfof affected children are under age five, although kidney involvement is more likely to be severe in older children. Compared to children, adults had more severe and frequent kidney involvement.Symptoms occur over a period of days to several weeks: Skin rash, joint aches and pains, usually in knees and ankles, occasional swelling, abdominal pain and renal disease manifesting mostly as hematuria (blood in your urine), proteinuria (abnormal excretion of proteins in urine), edema (swelling) or alteration in the volume of urine. The hematuria may be noticed as red or tea-colored or cola-colored urine or the amount may be so small that it can only be seen under a microscope. The brain or the lung may also be involved in HSP.Even though the symptoms of HSP make it easier to diagnose in children, confirmation of the diagnosis of HSP requires evidence of tissue deposition in the skin or kidney of IgA immunoglobulin. Renal biopsy is another method to establish the diagnosis, but is reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain or in whom there is evidence of more severe renal involvement.",B

Metropathica hemorrhagica is best treated by :,Curettage of uterus,Progestogen,Estrogen,Clomiphene,"Metropathia hemorrhagica is a type of DUB, Anovulatory bleeding seen in premenopausal women. The basic fault may lie in the ovaries or may be due to disturbance of the rhythmic secretion of the gonadotropin. There is slow rise in secretion of estrogen but no negative feedback inhibition of FSH. The net effect is gradual rise in the level of estrogen with concomitant phase of amenorrhea for about 6-8wks. As there is no ovulation, endometrium is under the influence of estrogen without being opposed by growth limiting progesterone for prolonged period. After the variable period, estrogen level falls resulting in endometrail shedding with heavy bleeding. First line of treatment is medical therapy.progesterone are the main hormones used in DUB in all age groups. Common preparations used are Norethisterone and medoxyprogesterone acetate.

Lowest recurrence in nocturnal enuresis is seen with,Bed alarms,Desmopressin,Imipramine,Oxybutynin,"Enuresis Defined as normal, complete evacuation of the bladder at a wrong place and time at least twice a month after 5 year of age. More than 85% children attain complete diurnal and nocturnal control by 5 years of age. Enuresis is primary when the child has never been dry and secondary when bed wetting stas after a minimum period of six months of dryness at night. It is said to be monosymptomatic if not accompanied by any lower urinary tract infection and nocturnal if it occurs during sleep. It has to be differentiated from continuous or intermittent incontinence or dribbling.The bed is usually soaking wet in enuresis, compared to incontinence in which there is loss of urine without normal emptying of bladder. ETIOLOGY:- 1. Maturation delay is most likely cause. 2. Anxiety producing episodes during the 2 nd to 5 th years, the time for development of nocturnal bladder control, are associated with increased risk of enuresis. 3. Lack of circadian rhythm of ADH or impaired response of kidneys to ADH. 4. Secondary enuresis can be precipitated by acute stressful condition or traumatic experience. Bladder irritability due to urinary tract infection or severe constipation with the full rectum impinging on the bladder can cause enuresis. 5. Conditions causing polyuria, spina bifida, ectopic ureter and giggle and stress incontinence are other causes. Treatment:- General advice given to all enurectic children but active treatment need not begin before 6 years of age. Caffeinated drinks like tea , coffee, sodas should be avoided in evening. Adequate fluid intake during day as 40% in morning, 40% in afternoon and 20% in evening is recommended. First line of treatment is usually non pharmacological, comprising motivational therapy and use of alarm devices. Motivational therapy:- Successful in curing enuresis upto 25%. The child is reassured and provided emotional suppo.Every attempt is made to remove any feeling of guilt. The child is encouraged to assume active responsibility, including keeping a dry night diary, voiding urine before going to bed, and changing wet clothes and bedding. Dry nights should be credited with praise.punishments and angry parenteral response should be avoided. Child is encouraged both to void frequently enough to avoid urgency and daytime incontinence and to have daily bowel movement. Alarm therapy: Involves the use of device to elicit a conditioned response of awakening to the sensation of full bladder. Best used afteemr seven years if age. Successful in two third cases without much recurrence. The alarm device consists of a small sensor attached to child&;s underwear or a mat under the bed sheet and an alarm attached to the childs collar or at bedside. When the child stas wetting, sensors are activated thus causing the alarm to ring. Pharmacotherapy:- Used if enuresis persists despite alarm therapy, regular voiding habits, exclusion or treatment of constipation, exclusion of post voidal residual urine. Imipramine works by aleing the arousal sleep mechanism. It gives satisfactory initial response at dise of 1-2.5 mg/ kg/ day. Relapse rate after discontinuation of therapy seen. Cardiac arrythmia is a serious adverse effect. Anticholinergic drugs reduce uninhibited bladder contractions and are useful in children who have significant daytime urge incontinence besides nocturnal enuresis. Usual dose is 5 mg for oxybutynin, 2 mg for tolterodine. Desmopressin works by reducing volume of urine. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

In aeep transverse arrest inu delivery of baby is conducted by :,Cesarean section,Vacuum extraction,Keilland forcep and Manual rotation and forcep delivery both,All,"Ans. is a, b, c and d i.e. Cesarean section; Vaccum extraction; Keilland forcep; and Manual rotation and forcep delivery In case of occipto posterior position if paial anterior rotation occurs the head is arrested with the sagittal suture in the transverse diameter at the level of the ischial spines, after full dilatation of the cervix in spite of good uterine contractions. This condition is called as Deep Transverse Arrest. It occurs more commonly in android pelvis. Ventouse Ideal in all cases Manual rotation & If the obstetrician is well versed with this technique manual rotation followed by forceps application forceps application can be done Forceps rotation & Under general anaesthesia Keilland's forceps are used for rotation and delivery delivery in deep transverse arrest. Cesarean section If the pelvis is android or there is CPD, cesarean section should be done. In modern obstetrics, traumatic vaginal delivery causing intracranial hemorrhage is to be avoided at all costs and so there is increasing use of cesarean section for deep transverse arrest. Craniotomy If the baby is dead. Note : In most centres now a days, either cesarean section or vaccum extraction is performed, due to lack of experience in forceps rotation and manual rotation. It is extremely impoant to remember that if vaccum or forceps fails, no attempt should be made to persist with vaginal delivery. The procedure should be abandoned and immediate cesarean section undeaken. In late and neglected cases if the fetus is dead, craniotomy is an option in experienced hands. However, now days most obstetricians would prefer to perform cesarean section in cases of obstructed labour, even when the fetus is dead.",D

All of the following are neural tube defects except:,Myelomeningocele,Anencephaly,Encephalocele,Holoprosencephaly,"Ans. D. HoloprosencephalyNeural tube defects (NTDs) are a group of birth defects in which an opening in the spinal cord or brain remains from early in human development. In the 3rd week of pregnancy called gastrulation, specialized cells on the dorsal side of the embryo begin to change shape and form the neural tube. When the neural tube does not close completely, an NTD develops. There are 2 types of NTD: open and closed. Open NTDs occur when the brain and/or spinal cord are exposed at birth through a defect in the skull or vertebrae (back bones).Examples of open NTDs are anencephaly, encephaloceles, hydranencephaly, iniencephaly, schizencephaly, and spina bifida. Rarer types of NTDs are called closed NTDs. Closed NTDs occur when the spinal defect is covered by skin.

Child has lesion on buttocks since 2 year spreading peripherally with central scarring non symptomatic diagnosis?,Erythema annular cetrifugam,Erythema migrains,Erythema marginatum,Erythema Gyratum,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Erythema annulase cetrifugam Erythema annulare centrifugum : an asymptomatic or pruritic eruption of variable duration. The eruption may be associated with an underlying disease (eg, infection, malignancy, sarcoidosis, other systemic illness) The eruption begins as erythematous papules that spread peripherally while clearing centrally. These lesions enlarge at a rate of approximately 2-5 mm/d to produce annular, arcuate, figurate, circinate, or polycyclic plaques Lesions demonstrate a predilection for the thighs and the legs, but they may occur on the upper extremities, the trunk, or the face. The palms and the soles are spared. Erythema migrans: These lesions are typically less numerous, less circinate in configuration, and often accompanied by a history of a tick bite. Erythema gyratum repens: EAC can be distinguished from this condition by its slower rate of spread and by its less bizarre configuration. Also, erythema gyratum repens is almost always associated with an underlying malignancy. Erythema marginatum rheumaticum: This is a nonscaling gyrate erythema that by definition is found in association with rheumatic fever (10-18% of patients with rheumatic fever).",A

"A 6-month-old infant has poor weight gain, vomiting, episodic fevers, and chronic constipation. Laboratory studies reveal a urinalysis with a pH of 8.0, specific gravity of 1.010, 1+ glucose, and 1+ protein. Urine anion gap is normal. Serum chemistries show a normal glucose and a normal albumin with a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Serum phosphorus and calcium are low. What is the best diagnosis to explain these findings?",Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type 1,RTA type 3,RTA type 4,Hereditary Fanconi syndrome,"The nonspecific findings of anorexia, polydipsia and polyuria, vomiting, and unexplained fevers, along with the more specific laboratory abnormalities of glucosuria but normal blood sugar, abnormally high urine pH in the face of mild or moderate serum hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and mild albuminuria in the presence of normal serum protein and albumin, suggest Fanconi syndrome (also called global proximal tubular dysfunction). Fan- coni syndrome can be hereditary or acquired; hereditary forms are usually secondary to a genetic abnormality such as cystinosis, galactosemia, Wilson disease, and some mitochondrial abnormalities. A number of agents can cause Fanconi syndrome, including gentamicin (or other aminoglycosides), outdated tetracycline, cephalothin, cidofovir, valproic acid, streptozocin, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, cisplatin, ifosfamide, heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury, cadmium, uranium, platinum), paraquat, maleic acid, and toluene (from sniffing glue). The mechanism of action of these agents is through acute tubular necrosis, alteration of renal blood flow, intratubular obstruction, or allergic reactions within the kidney itself. Many of these toxic effects are reduced or eliminated with removal of the offending agent. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type 1 is a distal RTA, and has a positive urine anion gap, as does RTA type 4. Type 3 is not a recognized type of RTA. Congenital nephrotic syndrome is a rare version of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by edema early in infancy, with hypoalbuminemia.",D

Which of the following is the indication for using goniometer?,Amount of vaginal secretions,To measure width of genital hiatus,Gonococcal colony count,Urethrovesical angle,"Goniometer is used for measuring urethrovesical angle during Q-tip test for urinary incontinence. Q-Tip Test: If a urethra is poorly suppoed, it may display hypermobility during increases in intraabdominal pressures. To assess mobility, a clinician places the soft end of a cotton swab into the urethra to the urethrovesical junction. Failure to inse the swab to this depth typically leads to errors in assessment of urethrovesical junction suppo. Following local anaesthesia, a Valsalva maneuver is prompted, and the swab-excursion angle at rest and with Valsalva maneuver is measured with a goniometer or standard protractor. An excursion angle from rest and with Valsalva maneuver that measures >30 degrees above the horizontal plane indicates urethral hypermobility.

In a lady of 32 weeks pregnancy injection dexa- methasone is to given to prevent:,Respiratory distress syndrome,Neonatal convulsions,Neonatal jaundice,Cerebral palsy,"Administration of dexamethasone before delivery:

– Reduces the incidence and severity of intraventricular hemorrhage
– Accelerates fetal lung maturation in preterm labour and prevents hyaline membrane disease.

It should be given atleast 24 hours before delivery.
Its effect lasts for 7 days therefore earlier it was said that repeat injections of betamethasone should be given weekly. Recent trials have shown that repeated injection lead to an increase in incidence of cerebral palsy therefore repeated injections are not given.
Steroid of choice for lung maturity is Betamethasone.

“Steroid treatment is contraindicated in presence of overt infection.”
Fernando Arias 3/e, p 220
Steroid therapy in preterm labour:

Steroids are recommended for all women in preterm labour before 32 weeks with or without membrane ruptures in whom there is no evidence of chorioamnionitis. According to ACOG, single dose steroid injection is recommended between 24 to 32 weeks. There is no concensus regarding treatment between 32-34 weeks. Corticosteroid therapy is not recommended before 24 weeks.

Advantage:

Steroids reduce the rate of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis in the newborn.
The effect of treatment is maximal between 24 hours of the first dose and uptil 7 days.
Earlier it was recommended to give repeated doses weekly till the patient delivers but this practice is associated with significant fetal and neonatal side effects like cerebral palsy and should be abandoned.
Betamethasone is the steroid of choice as it also prevents periventricular leukomalacia although dexamethasone can also be used.
Dose:


Betamethasone = 2 doses of 12 mg, 24 hours apart,
Dexamethosane: 4 doses of 6 mg, 12 hours apart.",D

A 6 year old girl presents with Recurrent E.coli infection in urine. Ultrasound of abdomen shows Hydroureter and Hydronephrosis. Micturating cysto – urethrogram shows filling defect in urinary bladder. The likely diagnosis is –,Sacrococcygeal Teratoma,Vesicoureteric Reflux – grade II,Duplication of Ureter,Ureterocele,"IVP in ureterocele usually shows a round filling defect, sometimes large, in the bladder corresponding to the ureterocele, and characteristic finding of duplication of the collecting system (ureteroceles are nearly always associated with ureteral duplication)
Ureterocele :

Is a cystic dilatation of the terminal ureter, and is obstructive because of a pinpoint ureteral orifice.
It is more common in females
Affected children often are discovered by prenatal sonography or during an investigation of UTI (IVP)
Treatment : o transurethral incision of ureterocele : effectively relieves the obstruction but it may result in V.U.R. necessitating ureteral reimplantation later, or
' open excision of ureterocele and reimplantation 'as primary management'. About other options
An isolated VUR or Duplication of ureter do not explain the filing defect in the bladder.
Sacrococcygeal Teratoma :
The most common presentation here is with an abnormal, obvious protruding mass from the sacral area. Out of the 4 varieties known, only Type IV which contributes 9.8 % ie entirely pre-sacral and not visible externally (90.8% tumors are visible externally).
Bladder and Rectum may be displaced anteriorly but a filling defect is not characteristic as in ureterocele.

"A 7–year–old child presents to the paediatric clinic with ambiguous genitalia increasing with age. On examination, her height, weight and blood pressure were recorded within normal limits. Labia appeared bifid with 2 separate perineal openings, phallic length was 2.5 cm and no palpable gonads were noted in the inguinal region. USG shows the presence of Mullerian structures. The most probable diagnosis is –",Classic Salt–Wasting 21 Hydroxylase deficiency,Simple virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome,5–Alpha Reductase Deficiency,"Among the given options only 21 hydroxylase is the common cause of ambiguous genitalia.
Now the confusion arises, because 21-hydroxylase deficiency typically presents with salt wasting and hypotension, whereas the child in question is having normal BP.
Actually, some forms (simple virilizing form) of 21-hydroxylase deficiency have normal BP and no salt loss.

Type of 21-hydroxylase deficiency
(A) Classic salt wasting form

This is a severe form of deficiency characterized by features of both glucocorticoid (cortisol)/mineralocorticoid deficiency (salt wasting) and androgen excess. (Ambiguous genitalia in females). Males may be normal at birth.
This form typically manifests early, between 7-21 days of life and is a potentially life threatening condition.

(B) Classic simple virilizing form

Patients with classic simple virilizing form have impaired cortisol biosynthesis but do not develop salt loss.
Clinical features are caused solely by overproduction of androgens.
The only manifestation is ambiguous genitalia in a female child with varying degrees of clitoral enlargement and labial fusion.
Depending on the severity of clitoral enlargement and labial fusion, the diagnosis may be established at birth. However such patients may present in early childhood.

(C) Non-classic (acquired/late) from

Patients with non-classical form or late-onset form produce a normal amount of cortisol and/or aldosterone but at the expense of producing excess androgens.
These usually present in childhood or early adulthood with premature pubarche & symptoms/signs of PCOD. Hirsutism, Acne and Oligomenorrhea are the most common presenting features.",B

"At the time of delivery, a woman is noted to have a large volume of amniotic fluid. At 6 hours of age, her baby begins regurgitating small amounts of mucus and bile-stained fluid. Physical examination of the infant is normal, and an abdominal x-ray is obtained (see below). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this infant's disorder?",Gastric duplication,Pyloric stenosis,Esophageal atresia,Duodenal atresia,"The finding of polyhydramnios suggests high intestinal obstruction, signs of which include abdominal distention and early and repeated regurgitation. Distention usually is not present, as vomiting keeps the intestine decompressed. The bilestained vomitus of the infant places the obstruction distal to the ampulla of Vater, eliminating esophageal atresia and pyloric stenosis from consideration. The 'double bubble' sign on the x-ray is characteristic of duodenal atresia, which is compatible with the history. Midgut volvulus, which may obstruct the bowel in the area of the duodenojejunal junction, most often produces signs after an affected infant is 3 or 4 days old with acute onset of bilious vomitus. Gastric duplication does not usually produce intestinal obstruction; a cystic mass may be palpated on abdominal examination.

"In a child with respiratory distress, failure to thrive. His sweat chloride leveles were estimated 35 meq/L and 41 meq/L. What is next best test to do cystic fibrosis for diagnosis aEUR'",Nasal transmembrane potential difference,DNA analysis AF 508 mutation,CT chest,72 hour fecal fat estimation,"Trans epithelial nasal potential difference Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis Sweat chloride testing The sweat test is the standard approach to diagnosis. The diagnosis is made by elevated sodium and chloride level in the sweat > 60 meoll. Two tests on different days are required .for accurate diagnosis. A normal sweat chloride dose not exclude the diagnosis. Genotyping and other tests such as measurement of nasal membrane potential difference, pancreatic .function should be done if there is high clinical suspicion of cystic fibrosis. Nasal potential difference Measurement of nasal transepithelial potential difference in vivo can be useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Individuals with cystic fibrosis demonstrate a significantly more negative baseline nasal potential difference, with the topical application of amiloride there is loss of this potential difference. Nasal potential difference is a sensitive test of electrolyte transpo (CFTR) function that can be used to suppo or refute a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic analysis Cystic .fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. It is caused due to defect in CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein. Cystic fibrosis is associated with large number of mutations. More than 1500 CFTR polymoiphisms are associated with cystic fibrosis syndrome. The most prevalent mutation of CFTR is the deletion of single phenylalanine residue at amino acid 4.508 This mutation is responsible for high incidence of cystic fibrosis in nohern European populations. Approximately 50% of individuals with CF who are of nohern European ancestry are homozygous for 4.508 and > 70% carry at least one 4.508 gene. The remainder of patients has an extensive array of mutation, none of which has prevalence of more than several percent. Testing for cystic .fibrosis mutation was not possible because of the large no. of mutations associated with the disease. Now days commercial laboratories test for 30-80 of the most common CFTR mutations. This testing identifies > 90% individuals who carry 2 CF mutations. No where it is mentioned in the texts that testing only for 4508 is enough for diagnosis. Detection of atleast 2 CF mutations are necessary for making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The patient has features of cystic fibrosis but sweat chloride levels are normal. - To diagnose cystic .fibrosis in this patient, another laboratory evidence demonstrating CFTR dysfunction is required. This can be done by two methods:? - Demonstrating abnormal potential difference - Demonstrating abnormal CF mutations. But the diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis requires. - Demonstration of two CF mutations (demonstration of single abnormal F508 mutation is not enough) So we are left with abnormal nasal potential difference. - It is an established laboratory evidence for CFTR dysfunction and is accepted as a diagnostic criteria to establish the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis Presence of typical clinical features (respiratory, G.LT, genitourinary) OR A history of CF in a sibling OR A positive newborn screening test PLUS Laboratory evidence for CFTR Dysfunction Two elevated sweat chloride concentrations obtained on separate days OR Identification of two CF mutations OR An abnormal nasal potential difference",C

Normal value of Anti-Mullerian Hormone is,<1 ng/ml,2--6.8 ng/mL,6.8--10 ng/ml,>10ng/ml,"AMH is a peptide secreted by the Seoli cells in the testis and granulosa cells in the ovary. In the males, it inhibits the development of the Mullerian system. The absence of AMH results in the hermaphrodite. In the female, AMH is secreted by the granulosa cells after pubey. It helps in the follicular development and oocyte maturation. Normal value is 2-6.8 ng/mL; level <1ng/mL shows poor ovarian reserve, >10 ng/mL is seen in PCOD and hyperstimulation syndrome. Its level is related to precocious and delayed pubey, infeility and premature menopause. Its level is related and reflects the number of growing follicles. Estimation of serum AMH is used in the study of ovarian reserve in an infeile woman and a woman with secondary amenorrhoea. In in vitro feilization programme, it carries a prognostic value and helps to decide on donor egg.Reference: Shaw's Textbook of Gynecology; 16th edition; Chapter 3; Physiology",B

Thus, this option is also excluded. o Coming to hypoparathyroidism: As the name suggests, PTH is low in hypoparathyroidism. But, sometimes PTH may be in normal range (10-60 Pg/ml) and this is inappropriately normal PTH. However it is generally believed that 'Normal' levels of PTH in a patient with hypocalcemia indicate 'inappropriately normal PTH' and relative Hypoparathyroidism should always be considered as the initial diagnosis. `Serum PTH levels should be related to the concurrent serum calcium. High PTH is the normal response to hypocalcemia and therefore 'normal' PTH in a patient with Hypocalcemia indicates relative Hypoparathyroidism' -Practical Algorithms in Pediatric Endocrinology' by Hochberg (2007)/71. 'Because normally hypocalemia is a potent stimulus for secretion of PTH, patients with intact parathyroid gland function should be expected to have high circulating levels of PTH, during hypocalcemic episodes. Low levels of serum PTH and in some assays even inapropriately 'normal' levels despite hypocalcemia should prompt consideration of various form of hypoparathyroidism' - Principles and Practice of Endocrinology & Metabolism' by Beeker.",C

A child with recurrent urinary tract infections is most likely to show:,Posterior urethral valves,Vesicoureteric reflux,Neurogenic bladder,Renal and ureteric calculi,"Reflux is the most common cause of pyelonephritis and is found in 30% to 50% of children presenting with urinary tract infection. In primary reflux, the child (on average, between 2 and 3 years of age) usually presents with symptoms of pyelonephritis or cystitis.

A lady diagnosed with sputum positive TB. Best management is:,Wait for 2nd trimester to start ATT,Start Category I ATT in I trimester,Start Category II ATT in I trimester,Start Category III ATT I trimester,"Ans. B. Start Category I ATT in I trimestera. Tuberculosis during pregnancy should be diagnosed promptly and as early as possible.b. Late diagnosis and care is associated with 4-fold increase in obstetric morbidity and 9-fold increase in pre-term labor.c. Poor nutritional states, hypo-proteinemia, anaemia and associated medical conditions add to maternal morbidity and mortality.d. A foetus can get TB infection either by hematogenous spread through umbilical vein to foetal liver or by ingestion or aspiration of infected amniotic fluid True congenital TB is believed to be rare.e. The risk to neonate of getting TB infection shortly after the birth is greaterf. ATT should be started promptly as untreated disease presents a hazard to the mother and foetus.g. The same regimens are recommended for use in pregnancy as for the non-pregnant state except for withholding of Streptomycin. Doubts about the use of Pyrazinamide in pregnancy have since been set as rest. Currently, an intermittent regimen (thrice weekly on alternate days) under the DOTS strategy of RNTCP is being increasingly used world-wide for the pregnant women having TBh. None of the ATT drugs are teratogenic and ATT should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made sputum positive tuberculosis is category 1",B

Which of the following hormone promotes the development of fibroids ?,Testosterone,Estrogen only,Estrogen and Progesterone,Progesterone only,"Both estrogen and progesterone appear to promote the development of fibroids. Factors that increase overall lifetime exposure to estrogens, such as obesity and early menarche, increase the incidence. Decreased exposure to estrogen found with smoking, exercise, and increased parity is protective.Progesterone is impoant in the pathogenesis of fibroids, which have increased concentrations of progesterone receptors A and B compared with normal myometrium. The highest mitotic counts are found in fibroids at the peak of progesterone production.Ref: Berek and Novak&;s Gynecology; 15th edition; Chapter 15; Uterine Fibroids",C

Antihormonal substance used to induce ovulation :,Mifepristone,Clomiphene citrate,Tamoxifen,Raloxifen,"Ans. is b i.e. Clomiphene citrate 1. Clomiphene citrate is the initial treatment for most anovulatory infeile women. It is chemically similar to tamoxifen Clomiphene is a non steroidal triphenylethylene derivative which demonstrates both estrogen agonist and antagonist propeies (predominant). It is the agent of choice for women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea having sufficient ovarian function to maintain estrogen at a serum level of 40pg/ml. Patient selection : Normal gonadotropicdeg normoprolactinemicdeg patients with normal cycle with absent or infrequent ovulation.deg PCOSdeg Post pill amenorrhea.deg Dose : Initial dose of 25 to 50mgdeg is given daily from D2 - D 5. Ovulation is expected to occur about 5 - 7 days after the last day of therapy. If ovulation doesnot occur, dose is increased in 50mg steps to a maximum of 250mg daily. (Although doses > 100 mg /day are not approved by FDA). Therapy is in given for 4-6 cycles. Clomiphene will be successful in inducing ovulation in about 70% of women, with ovaries producing estrogen Switch over from clomiphene to more aggressive therapy is done when : There is no response to clomiphenedeg (even with 100 mg / day dosing). There is ovulatory response to clomiphene but no pregnancydeg (following 3 to 6 months of ovulatory response to clomiphene). Patients with pituitary insufficiencydeg These patients usually respond to Gonadotropins. Note : Letrozole - 2.5mg (non steroidal aromatase inhibitor) is found superior to clomiphene. 2. Gonadotropin therapy : Prerequisite for Gonadotropin therapy : Ovarian reserve must be present. The Gonadotropins used are Human menopausal Gonodotropin : -- It is a formulation containing equal amounts of FSH and LH (751U each). -- It is prepared from hormones obtained from urine of postmenopausal women. HCG is required as an ovulatory trigger. FSH : purified urinary FSH and Recombinant FSH are also available. 3. Gonadotropin releasing hormone : Pulsatile GnRH : If other methods have failed then pulsatile GnRH is needed in patients with anovulation and hypothalamic insufficiency. Other drugs which can be used to for ovulation : Bromocriptine/Cabergoline : Are used to to treat anovulation caused by increase in serum prolactin level. Coicosteroids : Use to treat anovulation due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

The most reliable fetal parameter for estimation of gestational age in first trimester is:,Femur length,G sac diameter,CRL,BPD,"Ans. C. CRLGestational age (GA) in the first trimester is usually calculated from the fetal crown-rump length (CRL). This is the longest demonstrable length of the embryo or fetus, excluding the limbs and the yolk sac. The correlation between CRL and GA is excellent until approximately 12 weeks. No sex or race differences are appreciable, but maternal characteristics, such as age and smoking, may have a significant effect beyond 10-week gestation. The GA estimate has a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 6 days, and it is most accurate between 7 and 10 weeks of pregnancy.

A newborn baby presented with profuse bleeding from umbilical stump after birth. Probable diagnosis is –,Factor XIII deficiency,VWF deficiency,Factor XII deficiency,Glanzmann thrombosthenia,"Bleeding from umbilical stump suggests Factor XIII deficiency.
Neonates with a positive bleeding history, particularly with features such as delayed bleeding, umbilical stump bleeding or miscarriages and in whom the initial panel of screening test is negative should be tested for factor XIII deficiency.
The normal screening tests such as PT and PTT are normal in factor XIII deficiency because factor XIII is needed to stabilize the clot after a fibrin clot has formed, so tests used for evaluating the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways are not affected. (Note, that factor XIII is used, once the clot has formed.)

Test used for evaluation of factor XIII

Test used in qualitative evaluation of factor XIII is evaluation of clot stability in 5M urea.
Clots formed from normal individuals remain stable in 5M urea, while clots from factor XIII deficient patient dissolve in urea.
This assay detects only the most severely affected patients with 1% to 2% factor XIII deficieincy or tests.

The incidence of the classical form of CAH is roughly 1:15 000, while that of the nonclassical form is approximately 1:100. Classical CAH can be fuher divided into a salt-wasting form (75%) and a simple virilizing form (25%). 21-Hydroxylase is necessary for the production of coisol and aldosterone. Lack of this enzyme shunts intermediate steroid precursors toward androgen production. Symptoms are related to excess androgens and, in the salt-wasting form of classical CAH, decreased aldosterone.
