Question: The pharmakokinetic change occurring in geriatric patient is due to
A. Gastric absorption
B. Liver metabolism
C. Renal clearance
D. Hypersensitivity
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: One of the most impoant pharmacokinetic changes associated with aging is decreased renal elimination of drugs. After age 40, creatinine clearance decreases an average of 8 mL/min/1.73 m2/decade; however, the age-related decrease varies substantially from person to person. Serum creatinine levels often remain within normal limits despite a decrease in GFR because older adults generally have less muscle mass and are generally less physically active than younger adults and thus produce less creatinine. Maintenance of normal serum creatinine levels can mislead clinicians who assume those levels reflect normal kidney function. Decreases in tubular function with age parallel those in glomerular function. Refer katzung 11/e p1039

Question: Superior vena cava is derived from:
A. Aortic arch
B. Pharyngeal arch
C. Cardinal vein
D. Vitelline vein
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Ans. C Cardinal veinRef; hangman's essesntial medical Embroyology pg. 57# During early embryonic development (through 4th week), paired cardinal veins drain the body. Anterior cardinal veins drain the head and upper limb buds, while posterior cardinal veins drain the body. Both the anterior and posterior veins on each side unite at the common cardinal veins that flow into the sinus venosus and ultimately into the common atrium (Image).# Anterior cardinal veins are retained. An anastomosis between the two forms the left brachiocephalic vein, and anterior segments from both form the jugular system for the head and neck (Image).# Most of the posterior segment on the left disappears except for that forming the left superior intercostal vein, whereas the right posterior segment forms the superior vena cava.Extra mileDefects of SVC Development* Double inferior vena cava occurs when the left supracardinal vein persists, thereby forming an additional inferior vena cava below the level of the kidneys.* Left superior vena cava occurs when the left anterior cardinal vein persists, forming a superior vena cava on the left side. The right anterior cardinal vein abnormally regresses.* Double superior vena cava occurs when the left anterior cardinal vein persists, forming a superior vena cava on the left side. The right anterior cardinal vein also forms a superior vena cava on the right side.

Question: All of the following are features of Lymph node histology except
A. Subcapsular sinus present
B. Both Efferent and Afferent are present
C. Coex and Medulla are present
D. Red pulp and White pulp are present
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Red pulp and White pulp are present in spleenHistologically, a lymph node is subdivided into three regions: coex, paracoex, and medulla. All three regions have a rich supply of sinusoids, enlarged endothelially lined spaces through which lymph percolates.The afferent lymph vessels pierce the capsule on the convex surface of the node and empty their lymph into the subcapsular sinus. This sinus is continuous with the coical sinuses and delivers the lymph into the medullary sinuses, eventually to enter the efferent lymphatic vessels.Reference: Krishna Garg Histology; 5th edition; Page no: 92

Question: In a 24 year old man weight of the upper limb is transmitted to the axial skeleton by:
A. Coracoacromial ligament
B. Coracoclavicular ligament
C. Costoclavicular ligament
D. Coracohumeral ligament
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The axial skeleton shapes the longitudinal axis of the human body. Coracoclavicular ligament suspends the scapula from the lower one third of the clavicle and forms a strong bond between them. The weight of the upper limb is transmitted to the axial skeleton through this ligament. A fracture of the clavicle, medial to the attachment of this ligament leads to drooping of upper limb.

B. Atrioventricular orifice and fossa ovalis
C. SVC and right atrium
D. Right an dleft coronary artery
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Ans. is 'a' i.e., Pulmonary orifice and atrioventricular orifice Interior of right ventricle* It is anteroinferior chamber and projects to the left of right atrium. It is in contact with the sternum.* It is divided into -i) Rough inflowing part (ventricle proper)# It is developed from right half of primitive ventricle.# Its interior is rough due to the presence of muscular ridges known as trabeculae carneae, which are more prominent in apical region.# Trabeculae carneae are of 3 types: -1. Ridges - Linear elevations.Supraventricular crest - a ridge present between the pulmonary and atrioventricular orifices, extends downwards in the posterior wall of the infundibulum.2. Bridges -'Muscular elevations with fixed ends on ventricular walls, the center being free.Septomarginal trabecula: It is a specialized bridge which extends from the right of ventricularseptum to the base of anterior papillary muscle. It contains the right branch of atrioventricular bundle.3. Papillary muscles are conical projections of muscle fiber bundles. Their base is attached to the ventricular wall and the apex is attached to the chordae tendinae, which are further attached to the cusps of atrioventricular (AV) valves. There are three papillary muscles in the right and two in the left ventricle. They regulate closure of atrioventricular valves.ii) Smooth outflowing part (infundibulum or conus arteriosus)# Smooth outflowing part develops from mid portion of bulbus cordis and surrounds pulmonary valveSupraventricular crest (crista supraventriculars) or infundibuloventricular crest separates tricuspid (AV) orifice and pulmonary orifice, i.e. inlet and outlet parts.

Question: Opening of mouth is caused by:
A. Lateral pterygoid
B. Medial pterygoid
C. Temporalis
D. Masseter
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Ans. A Lateral pterygoidRef: Grays, 41st ed. pg. 507-508* The primary function of the lateral pterygoid muscle is to pull the head of the condyle out of the mandibular fossa along the articular eminence to protrude the mandible.* The effort of the lateral pterygoid muscles acts in helping lower the mandible and open the jaw whereas unilteral action of a lateral pterygoid produces contralateral excursion (a form of mastication), usually performed in concert with the medial pterygoids.* Unlike the other three muscles of mastication, the lateral pterygoid is the only muscle of mastication that assists in depressing the mandible i.e. opening the jaw. At the beginning of this action it is assisted by the digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid muscles.

Question: Thymic hypoplsia is seen in which of the following
A. Wiskott Aldrich syndrome
B. Digeorge syndrome
C. IgA deficiency
D. Agammaglobulinamia
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Ref Robbins 9/e p224 Thymic Hypoplasia: DiGeorge Syndrome DiGeorge syndrome results from a congenital defect in thymic development with deficient T cell maturation. T cells are absent in the lymph nodes, spleen, and peripheral blood, and infants with this defect are extremely vulnera- ble to viral, fungal, and protozoal infections. Patients are also susceptible to infection with intracellular bacteria, because of defective T cell-mediated immunity. B cells and serum immunoglobulins are generally unaffected. The disorder is a consequence of a developmental mal- formation affecting the third and fouh pharyngeal pouches, structures that give rise to the thymus, parathy- roid glands, and poions of the face and aoic arch. Thus, in addition to the thymic and T cell defects, there may be parathyroid gland hypoplasia, resulting in hypocalce- mic tetany, as well as additional midline developmental abnormalities. In 90% of cases of DiGeorge syndrome there is a deletion affecting chromosomal region 22q11, as discussed in Chapter 6. Transplantation of thymic tissue has successfully treated some affected infants. In patients with paial defects, immunity may improve spontane- ously with age.

Question: In pyogenic liver abscess commonest route of spread
A. Hematogenous through poal vein.
B. Ascending infection through biliary tract
C. Hepatic aery
D. Local spread
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: "Along with cryptogenic infections, infections from the biliary tree are presently the most common identifiable cause of the hepatic abscess. Biliary obstruction results in bile stasis, with the potential for subsequent bacterial colonization, infection and ascension into the liver. This process is k/a ascending suppurative cholangitis. The nature of biliary obstruction is mostly related to stone disease or malignancy. In Asia, intrahepatic stones and cholangitis (recurrent pyogenic cholangitis) is a common cause, whereas, in the Western world, malignant obstruction is becoming a more predominant factor" Ref : Sabiston 18/e p1485

Question: Function of external oblique muscle:
A. Anterior flexion of veebral column
B. Active expiration
C. Closure of inguinal ring
D. All of the above
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: External oblique: Most superficial muscle which originates from the outer pa of the 5th to 12th ribs on each side of the rib cage. This muscle then runs diagonally down each side and connects to the iliac crest, linea alba, and the pubis. Function: External oblique contributes to the maintenance of abdominal tone, increasing intra-abdominal pressure (as in active expiration), and lateral flexion of the trunk against resistance. Bilateral contraction flexes the trunk forward and aid in movement of spine and back. Contraction of external oblique muscle approximates the two crura (medial and lateral) of superficial inguinal ring like a slit valve to maintain the integrity of inguinal canal.

Question: A 70-year-old man comes to casualty with urinary retention and back pain. Which investigation should be performed -
A. Serum acid phosphatase
B. Serum Calcium
C. Serum alkaline phosphatase
D. Serum electrophoresis
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: pt. is suspected to have Ca Prostate as Prostatic Ca is the most common malignant tumor in men over 65 yrs. of age. Symptoms of Bladder outlet obstruction and back pains (due to bony metastasis in the pelvis & lumbar veebra) indicate towards prostate Ca. Serum acid phosphates is a tumor marker of prostate Ca. But now serum acid phosphates assay has been superseded by PSA assay (Prostate specific antigen). Prostate-specific antigen It is a glycoprotein produced only in the prostatic cells (both benign & malignant). It facilitates liquefaction of semen. It is neither sensitive nor specific for early prostate carcinoma (it is prostate specific and not prostate cancer specific), neveheless it gives some help in making a diagnosis. Normal serum level - less than 4 mg/ml 4 - 10 mg/ml - this range is common for both BHP and Ca. More than 10 mg/ml - approx 75% will have cancer. Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density is used to detect Prostate cancer. PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than .75 mg/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0.5 mg/ml, per year should be used to advise biopsy. PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level. Values < 0.10 are consistent with BPH. > 0.15 suggest cancer Ref : Bailey & Love 25/e p1356

Question: Which of the following extraocular muscles does not arise from annulus:
A. Inferior rectus
B. Medial rectus
C. Lateral rectus
D. Superior oblique
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: The annulus of Zinn, also known as the annular tendon or common tendinous ring, is a ring of fibrous tissue surrounding the optic nerve at its entrance at the apex of the orbit.It can be used to divide the regions of the superior orbital fissure.The aeries surrounding the optic nerve are sometimes called the "circle of Zinn-Haller" (CZH).Some sources distinguish between these terms more precisely, with the annulus tendineus communis being the parent structure, divided into two pas:A lower, the ligament or tendon of Zinn, which gives origin to the Rectus inferior, pa of the Rectus internus, and the lower head of origin of the Rectus lateralis.An upper, which gives origin to the Rectus superior, the rest of the Rectus medialis, and the upper head of the Rectus lateralis. This upper band is sometimes termed the superior tendon of Lockwood.The site of origin of the superior oblique muscle is from the lesser wing of sphenoid above the optic canal.

Question: a child gets good marks in his exam and his father got a bicycle, he staed to read well, what is the line of therapy
A. positive reinforcement
B. negative reinforcement
C. omission
D. punishment
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Behavioral therapy is learning given by BF Skinner , according to him all behaviors are learned phenomenon and thus can be unlearned Positive reinforcement a type of reinforcement when a behavior is rewarded there is more chance that the behavior is repeated Negative reinforcement is that when a behavior is done and an aversive response is removed, the behavior is repeated. When I go and meet my girlfriend, she checks my messages and picks up fight (aversive response) suddenly I delete all messages one day and that day there was no fight (no aversive response) then that behavior is repeated (delete all messages before meeting my girlfriend) Extinction is the type of reinforcement where a behavior is done and a rewarding response is removed the chance is that behavior will not be repeated A child likes to play with children( reward) but when the child fights with other children( undesirable behavior) the child will be removed from playing( removing a reward) , then the child stops fighting with other children( reduction of undesirable behaviour) Ref. kaplon and sadock synopsis, 11 th edition, pg no. 845

Question: In rectus sheath which branch of aoa make anastmosis with superior epigastric aery
A. Subclan aery
B. External iliac aery
C. Internal iliac aery
D. External carotid A
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The external iliac aeries are two major aeries which bifurcate off the common iliac aeries anterior to the sacroiliac joint of the pelvis. They proceed anterior and inferior along the medial border of the psoas major muscles. They exit the pelvic girdle posterior and inferior to the inguinal ligament about one third laterally from the inseion point of the inguinal ligament on the pubic tubercle at which point they are referred to as the femoral aeries. The external iliac aery is usually the aery used to attach the renal aery to the recipient of a kidney transplant. Ref - BDC vol2 6e pg339 , britannica.com

Question: A 35 year old male presents to the urologist for an infeility evaluation. A biopsy of his testis is performed to check sperm production and maturation. A microscopic section reveals only a few germ cells near the basal lamina in the seminiferous tubule. Which of the following cells is the germ cell closest to the basal lamina in the seminiferous tubule?
A. Primary spermatocyte
B. Secondary spermatocyte
C. Spermatid
D. Spermatogonia
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Maturation of germ cells (spermatogenesis) within the seminiferous tubules occurs in a concentric pattern with the less mature spermatogonia near the basal lamina and the mature forms near the tubule center. Spermatogonia are 2N cells and mature into larger primary spermatocytes (4N) . These mature into secondary spermatocytes (2N) , and finally into spermatids (1N) . Spermatids undergo spermatogenesis to become mature spermatozoa . Acrosomes form from the Golgi apparatus and a flagellum forms from microtubules. Unneeded organelles are shed. The seminiferous tubules of a reproductive-age male should exhibit all stages of maturation, with mature flagellated sperm in their centers.

Question: Axis is the name for:
A. IV cervical vertebra
B. III cervical vertebra
C. II cervical vertebra
D. I cervical vertebra
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Second cervical vertebra (axis)

Presence of odontoid process.
Transverse processes are small and lack the anterior tubercle.
Anterior margin of the inferior surface of the body projects downwards to a considerable extent.
Foramen transversarium is directed superolaterally (expand in typical vertebrae it is directed vertically)
Inferior surface presents a deep and wide inferior vertebral notch placed in front of the inferior articular process. The superior vertebral notch is shallow and is present behind the superior articular process.

Key concept:
Second cervical vertebra is called the axis. it is identiﬁed by the presence of the dens or odontoid process which is a strong, tooth-like process projecting upwards from the body. The dens is usually  believed to represent the centrum or body of the atlas which has fused with the centrum of the axis.

They represent approximately 60-70% of all parotid tumors and 90% of submandibular benign tumors. These neoplasms affect females more than males and are commonly seen in the third to sixth decades of life. Histologically, pleomorphic adenomas arise from the distal poions of the salivary ducts, including the intercalated ducts and acini.

Question: Which bone do not contributes to the medial wall of the orbit?
A. Ethmoid
B. Lacrimal
C. Frontal
D. Zygoma
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: ANSWER: (D) ZygomaREF: Grays anatomy 39th edition, page 688-690 style="font-size: 1.04761904761905em; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif">part_8/chapter_45.htmlIndirect repeat in December 2010WALLS OF THE ORBIT:The orbit possesses four walls; a roof, lateral wall, floor, and medial wall.* The roof (frontal and sphenoid bones) presents the fossa for the lacrimal gland anterolaterally and the trochlear pit for the cartilaginous or bony pulley of the superior oblique muscle anteromedially. The optic canal lies in the posterior part of the roof, between the roots of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. It transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery from the middle cranial fossa.The posterior aspect of the lateral wall (zygomatic and sphenoid bones) is demarcated by the superior and inferior orbital fissures, The superior orbital fissure lies between the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. It communicates with the middle cranial fossa and transmits cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, the three branches of the ophthalmic nerve, and the ophthalmic veins. The inferior orbital fissure communicates with the infratemporal and pterygopalatine fossae and transmits the zygomatic nerve. The lateral walls of the two orbits are set at approximately a right angle from one another, whereas the medial walls are nearly parallel to each otherThe floor (maxilla, zygomatic, and palatine bones) presents the infraorbital groove and canal for the nerve and artery of the same name. The inferior oblique muscle arises anteromedially, immediately lateral to the nasolacrimal canal.The medial wall (ethmoid, lacrimal, and frontal bones) is very thin. Its main component (the orbital plate of the ethmoid) is papyraceous (paper-thin). At the junction of the medial wall with the roof, the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina transmit the nerves and arteries of the same name.

The tiny droplets may remain suspended in the air for several hours and are easily inhaled. Ref: Textbook of microbiology; Ananthanarayan and paniker's; 10th edition; Pg: 355

Question: In acute inflammation the tissue response consists of all except
A. Vasodilation
B. Exudation
C. Neutrophilic response
D. Granuloma formation
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Ref Robbins9/e p97 Granulomatous inflammation is a distinctive pattern of chronic inflammation characterized by aggregates of acti- vated macrophages with scattered lymphocytes. Granulo- mas are characteristic of ceain specific pathologic states; consequently, recognition of the granulomatous pattern is impoant because of the limited number of conditions (some life-threatening) that cause it (Table 2-8). Granulo- mas can form under three settings: * With persistent T-cell responses to ceain microbes (such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, T. pallidum, or fungi), in which T cell-derived cytokines are responsible for chronic macrophage activation. Tuberculosis is the proto- type of a granulomatous disease caused by infection and should always be excluded as the cause when granulomas are identified. * Granulomas may also develop in some immune- mediated inflammatory diseases, notably Crohn disease, which is one type of inflammatory bowel disease and an impoant cause of granulomatous inflammation in the United States. * They are also seen in a disease of unknown etiology called sarcoidosis, and they develop in response to rela- tively ine foreign bodies (e.g., suture or splinter), forming so-called foreign body granulomas.
