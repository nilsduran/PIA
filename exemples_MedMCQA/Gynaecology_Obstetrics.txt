Question: Ulipristal acetate is a/an:
A. GnRH agonist
B. Androgen antagonist
C. Selective estrogen receptor modulator
D. Selective progesterone receptor modulator
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Ans. is d, i.e. Selective progesterone receptor modulatorRef: Harrison's Principles of Internal medicine 19th/ed, p2391Ulipristal acetate (trade name Ella One in the European Union, Ella in the US for contraception, and Esmya for uterine fibroid) is a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM).PharmacodynamicsAs an SPRM, ulipristal acetate has partial agonistic as well as antagonistic effects on the progesterone receptor. It also binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, but is only a weak anti-glucocorticoid relative to mifepristone, and has no relevant affinity to the estrogen, androgen and mineralocorticoid receptors. Phase II clinical trials suggest that the mechanism might consist of blocking or delaying ovulation and of delaying the maturation of the endometrium.Medical Uses* Emergency contraception: For emergency contraception, a 30mg tablet is used within 120 hours (5 days) after an unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It has been shown to prevent about 60% of expected, pregnancies, and prevents more pregnancies than emergency contraception with levonorgestrel.* Treatment of uterine fibroids: Ulipristal acetate is used for preoperative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age in a daily dose of a 5mg tablet. Treatment of uterine fibroids with ulipristal acetate for 13 weeks effectively controlled excessive bleeding due to uterine fibroids and reduced the size of the fibroids.InteractionsUlipristal acetate is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. Ulipristal acetate is likely to interact with substrates of CYP3A4, like rifampicin, phenytoin, St John's wort, carbamazepine or ritonavir. Therefore, concomitant use with these agents is not recommended. It might also interact with hormonal contraceptives and progestogens such as levonorgestrel and other substrates of the progesterone receptor, as well as with glucocorticoids.Adverse EffectsCommon side effects include abdominal pain and temporary menstrual irregularity or disruption. Headache and nausea were observed under long-term administration (12 weeks), but not after a single dose.ContraindicationsUlipristal acetate should not be taken by women with severe liver diseases because of its CYP-mediated metabolism. It has not been studied in women under the age of 18.Pregnancy: Unlike levonorgestrel, and like mifepristone, ulipristal acetate is embryotoxic in animal studies. Before taking the drug, a pregnancy must be excluded.

Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Ans. is a, i.e. Sheehan's syndromeRef: Shaw 14th/ed, p256-257* Kallmann's sydnrome is due to hypothalamic dysfunction characterized by a deficiency of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) causing a hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. This is associated with anosmia. It can occasionally be associated with optic problems, such as color blindness or optic atrophy, nerve deafness, cleft palate, cryptorchidism, renal agenesis, and mirror movement disorder.* MRKH syndrome, also known as Mullerian agenesis is due to anatomical absence of uterus. This is the second most common cause of primary amenorrhea.* Turner's syndrome is a type of gonadal dysgenesis and is overall the most common cause of primary amenorhea* Sheehan's syndrome is postpartum pituitary necrosis. It leads to secondary amenorrhea and not primary amenorrhea.

Question: A 38-year-old woman complains to her physician of chronic pelvic pain that is much worse during her menstrual periods. Pelvic examination demonstrates an enlarged uterus with multiple palpable masses. Ultrasound shows that a large number of ball-like masses up to 6 cm diameter are present in the uterus. Most cases of this type of tumor are found at which of the following sites?
A. Intramurally in the cervix of the uterus
B. Intramurally in the fundus or body of the uterus
C. Submucosally in the cervix of the uterus
D. Submucosally in the fundus or body of the uterus
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The vast majority of leiomyomas are found in the uterine fundus or body; with only 3% being found in the cervix. Of the leiomyomas in the fundus or body, 95% are intramural, with the remainder being located subserosally or submucosally.

Question: Forceps delivery is done in all except:
A. Mentoposterior
B. Deep transverse arrest
C. After coming head
D. Maternal heart disease
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Option â€˜aâ€™
Mentoposterior: Before going on to mentoposterior, lets see mentoanterior.
Mentoanterior
â€‹Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 390
In mentoanterior face presentation there is place for spontaneous vaginal delivery and liberal episiotomy is all that is required. In case of delay, forceps delivery is done.
In mentoposterior: 20 to 30% cases rotate anteriorly through 3/8 of circle and deliver as mento anterior, there fore trial of labour may be given in hope of anterior rotation of chin, followed by spontaneous/forceps delivery. In the rest 70-80%, incomplete anterior rotation/ non rotation occurs.
In these persistent mentoposterior: cesarean section is the only management. Therefore in mentoposterior per se forceps is not applied, only when it rotates anteriorly and becomes mentoanterior, forceps are applied.
Option â€˜bâ€™
Deep transverse arrest
Management options in case of deep transverse arrest are:
Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 372
Ventouse: Ideal for all cases
Cesarean section: If the pelvis is android or there is CPD, cesarean section should be done. In modern obstetrics, traumatic vaginal delivery causing intracranial hemorrhage is to be avoided at all costs and so there is increasing use of cesarean section for deep transverse arrest.
Other options are:

Manual rotation followed by outlet forceps application.
Forceps rotation and delivery using Keilland forceps.
Craniotomy if the baby is dead.

As far as options â€˜câ€™ and â€˜dâ€™ are concerned: In after coming head of breech, and in heart disease forceps are routinely applied.

Question: The drug that inhibits uterine contractility and cause pulmonary edema is :
A. Ritodrine
B. Nifedipine
C. lndomethacin
D. Atosiban
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Ans. is a i.e. Ritodrine Pulmonary edema is a serious complication of beta-adrenergic therapy (ritodrine) and MgSO4. This complication occurs in patients receiving oral or (more common) intravenous treatment. It occurs more frequently in patients who have excessive plasma volume expansion, such as those with twins or those who have received generous amounts of intravenous fluids and in patients with chorioamnionitis. Patient presents with respiratory distress, bilateral rales on auscultation of the lungs, pink frothy sputum, and typical X-ray picture. Patients receiving IV beta-adrenergic drugs should be monitored continuously with pulse oxymeter to anticipate the development of pulmonary edema.

Question: Which of the following is indicated by the term 'mittelschmerz'?
A. Fern pattern of cervical mucus
B. Peritoneal irritation from corpus hemorrhagicum
C. Rise of body temperature due to effect of progesterone
D. LH surge before ovulation
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The follicle that ruptures at the time of ovulation promptly fills with blood, forming what is sometimes called a corpus hemorrhagicum. Minor bleeding from the follicle into the abdominal cavity may cause peritoneal irritation and fleeting lower abdominal pain ("mittelschmerz"). The granulosa and theca cells of the follicle lining promptly begin to proliferate, and the clotted blood is rapidly replaced with yellowish, lipid-rich luteal cells, forming the corpus luteum. Ref: Alford C., Nurudeen S. (2013). Chapter 4. Physiology of Reproduction in Women. In A.H. DeCherney, L. Nathan, N. Laufer, A.S. Roman (Eds), CURRENT Diagnosis & Treatment: Obstetrics & Gynecology, 11e.

Question: A 55-year-old woman was found to have Ca cervix, FIGO stage 2-3, locally advanced. What would be the management?:
A. Surgery plus chemotherapy
B. radiotherapy plus chemotherapy
C. Chemotherapy
D. Radiotherapy plus HPV vaccine
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: As discussed in detail in preceeding text best for cervical cancer of (stages II B to IV A) is chemoradiation (i.e. chemotherapy and radiotherapy), where by cisplatin is used as a radiosensitiser to increase the sensitivity of the cells to radiotherapy before giving radiotherapy.
Since in this question â€“chemotherapy + radiotherapy is given as one of the options, hence, we will mark it as the correct option.

Question: During a hysterectomy and an oophorectomy, the uterine and ovarian vessels must be ligated. These vessels can be found in which ligaments?
A. Broad and ovarian
B. Broad and suspensory
C. Round and ovarian
D. Round and suspensory
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The uterine vessels are found in the inferior poion of the broad ligament, while the ovarian vessels are found in the suspensory ligaments of the ovaries. The suspensory ligaments of the ovaries are peritoneal folds covering ovarian aeries , veins, nerves, and lymphatics as the structures pass over the pelvic brim to reach the ovary. The ovarian ligament proper is a round cord which attaches the ovary to the uterus, just below the entrance of the uterine tube into the uterus. The round ligament of the uterus is a connective tissue band that attaches the uterus to the inner aspect of the labium majus,it traverses the inguinal canal and it is found in the broad ligament.

Question: True statement regarding sarcoma botryoides:a)  Involvement of vaginab) Grape like growth seenc) Common in old aged) Malignant
A. abd
B. bcd
C. abc
D. ab
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common malignancy of the vagina in infants and children.
Most common subtype of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is sarcoma botyroides

Seen in infants and children less than 5 years of age.
"This rare tumor develops almost exclusively in girls younger than 5 years, although vaginal and cervical sarcoma botryoides have been reported in females aged 15 to 20 years." Â - William Gynae 1st /ed p 683
"Sarcoma botryoides are usually seen in patients who are younger than 5 years of age." - COGDT 10th ed p 831
In infants and children, sarcoma botyroides is usually found in vagina, in reproductive age females rhabdomyosarcoma is seen within the cervix and after menopause within the uterus.
The gross appearance of the tumor resembles pinkish bunch of grapes â€”it can be in the form of multiple polyp like structures or can be a solitary growth with pedunculated appearance.
Histologically-its characteristic finding is "rhabdomyoblast."

Clinical features
The presenting features are:


Blood stained vaginal discharge
Anaemia and cachexia

Management
Chemotherapy â€” vincristine actinomycin D and cyclophasphamide followed by conservative surgery to excise residual tumor is the treatment of choice. Newer studies have revealed that primary chemotherapy without surgery is adequate for most patients.

Question: LH surge occurs at
A. At the time of ovulation
B. 5-6 days before ovulation
C. 24-36 hours before ovulation
D. 24 - 72 hours after ovulation
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: C. i.e. (24 - 36 hours before ovulation) (37-Shaw's 14th/64-Dutta 4th)* LH surge precedes ovulation by 24 to 36 hours (mean 30 hours) and minimum of 75 ng/ml is required for ovulation (37 - Shaw's 14th)* LH levels remains almost static throughout the cycle except at least 12 hours prior to vulation. When it attains its peak, called LH surge (64 - Dutta 4th)* The main function of LH is steroidogenic, but along with FSH. It is responsible for full maturation of the graffian follicle and oocyte and ovulation

B. Slight left axis deviation in ECG
C. Diastolic murmur
D. Pulse rate is decreased
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e., Slight left axis deviation in ECG Cardiovascular systemo Anatomical changes heart is pushed upwards & outward. Apex beat is shifted in 4th intercostals space. A systolic murmur can be heard in apical or pulmonary area. Mammary' murmur is a continuous hissing murmur audible over tricuspid area in left 2nd & 3rd intercostals space. ECG shows left axis deviation. S3 and rarely S4 can be heard.o Cardiac output starts to increase from 5th week of pregnancy, reaches its peak 40-50% at about 30-34 weeks. It is lowest in sitting or supine position & highest is the right or left lateral or knee chest position. CO further increases by 50% during labour and immediately following delivery. CO returns to pre labour values by one hour following delivery and to the pre-pregnant level by another 4 weeks,o Blood pressure systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreases. Maternal BP is decreased,o Venous pressure femoral venous pressure is raised,o Supine hypotension syndrome (postural hypotension)o Regional distribution of blood flow uterine blood flow is increased from 50 ml per minute in non-pregnant state to 750ml near term.

Question: In a lady at 32 weeks pregnancy is given an injection of dexamethasone to prevent which of the following in the newborn ?
A. Respiratory Distress Syndrome
B. Neonatal convulsion
C. Neonatal jaundice
D. Cerebral palsy
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The lung maturity occurs at 34 weeks of gestation and this is ceified by checking the L:S ratio which should be > 2:1 or appearance of Phosphatidyl glycerol in the amniotic fluid. Maternal administration of coicosteroid is advocated where the pregnancy is less than 34 weeks. This helps in fetal lung maturation so that the incidence of RDS, Intra Ventricular Hemorrhage , Necrotising Enterocolitis , and Patent Ductus Aeriosus are minimized. Respiratory distress of newborn often results in multiple debility in the fetus if not prevented.

Question: Initial site of RBC production in fetus-
A. Gestational sac
B. Yolk sac
C. Placeta
D. Fetal bones
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Ans. is 'b' i.e., Yolk sac* Embryonic and fetal hematopoiesis occurs in three phases: megaloblastic, hepatic, and myeloid. At each phase of RBC development both the sites of production and the cell composition change.* Sites and stages of fetal erythropoiesis: Primitive erythropoiesis begins in the yolk sac at 2 to 3 weeks after conception. By the end of the first trimester, the liver has become the main erythroid organ. The liver is the primary source of red blood cells during the second trimester, and the bone marrow is the primary source of red blood cells during the last trimester

Question: One of the following is used for sex chromatin testing :
A. Barr body
B. Testosterone receptors
C. Hormone levels
D. Phenotypic features
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Chromosomal sex can be determined by the study of the leucocytes or by simply taking a smear from the buccal mucosa The nuclei of the female chromosome contains a stainable body called the sex chromatin, hence female cells are termed as chromatin positive. In epithelial cell nuclei this small peripherally situated darkly staining nodule is called Barr body. Male cell nuclei lack this body and termed chromatin negative.

Question: Which of the following anti-hypertensive is contraindicated in pregnancy:
A. Beta blockers
B. ACE inhibitors
C. Methyldopa
D. Ca channel blockers
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Ans. (b) ACE inhibitorsRef KDT 6th ed. 553; Williams 24th ed, /: 1025* ACEs are the drugs which inhibit the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. They can cause severe fetal malformations when given in the second and third trimesters.* These include: Hypocalvaria and renal dysfunction and are also teratogenic and because of this, they are not recommended during pregnancy* Angiotensin-receptor blockers act in a similar manner.But, instead of blocking the production of angiotensin- II, they inhibit binding to its receptor. They are presumed to have the same fetal effects as ACE inhibitors and thus are also contraindicated.Antihypertensive to be avoided during pregnancyAntihypertensive safer during pregnancy* ACE inhibitors (Ex- captopril, enelapril etc.)* Angiotensin antagonist (losartan, telmesartan)* Thiazide diuretics (Ex- hydrochlorthiazide)* Furosemide* Propanolol* Nitroprusside* Hydralazine* Methyldopa* Atenolol* Metoprolol* Labetalol-DOC* Nifedipine* Prazosin and ClonidineDrugs and their respective risk* Diuretics: tend to reduce blood volume; increase risk of placental infarcts, fetal wastage, stillbirth.* ACE inhibitors, ATI antagonists: growth retardation and fetal damage risk.* Propanolol: causes low birth weight, neonatal hypoglycemia and bradycardia.* Nitroprusside: contraindicated in eclampsia.

Question: First investigation done for abnormal uterine bleeding in reproductive age group is _______
A. Ultrasonography transabdominal
B. Pap smear
C. Urine Beta HCG
D. Ultrasonography transvaginal
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The first investigation for abnormal uterine bleeding is Urine Beta HCG to rule ouut pregnancy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding(AUB): is a common and debilitating condition. Chronic AUB was defined as &;bleeding from the uterine corpus that is abnormal in volume, regularity and/or timing that has been present for the majority of the last 6 months. AUB may affect females of all ages. Factors that influence incidence most greatly are age and reproductive status. A structured approach for establishing the cause using the FIGO PALM COEIN classification system will facilitate accurate diagnosis and inform treatment options. In the reproductive age group , the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis matures, and anovulatory uterine bleeding is encountered less often. The diagnostic goal is exclusion of pregnancy and identification of the underlying pathology to allow optimal treatment. Miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and hydatidiform moles may cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Pregnancy complications are quickly excluded with determination of urine and serum Beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG levels). This is typically obtained on all reproductive-aged women. Other options: Pap smear evaluation is usually done for cervical and endometrial cancers which are commonly seen in peri and post menopausal women. Transvaginal sonography (TVS) typically offers greater patient comfo and suitable detection of postmenopausal endometrial hyperplasia and cancer compared to transabdominal ultrasonography.

Explanation: Glucosuria during pregnancy is not necessarily abnormal. The appreciable increase in glomerular filtration, together with impaired tubular reabsorptive capacity for filtered glucose, accounts in most cases for glucosuria. Though glucosuria is common during pregnancy, the possibility of diabetes mellitus should not be Ignored when it is identified.

Question: In stage III ovarian cancer patient with upper abdominal disease < 5cm, management of choice is
A. Debulking surgery
B. Mantle cell irradiation
C. Abdomino-pelvic radiotherapy
D. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: Management of Advanced stage diseaseIncludes stage III and IVDebulking surgery versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by Postoperative chemotherapyPrimary cytoreduction surgery is the preferred in1. Retroperitoneal only disease preoperatively 2. Patients with stage IIIC or IV disease with good performance status who have < 5cm upper abdominal disease 3. Patients who are considered ideal for intraperitoneal chemotherapy if optimally reducedNeoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery is preferred in1. Patients with bulky upper abdominal peritoneal disease >5cm in diameter2. Medically unfit for surgeryPostoperative chemotherapySystemic chemotherapy with 6 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxelPostoperative radiotherapy1. Not effective compared to chemotherapy2. Used clear cell or mucinous carcinomasMAINTENANCE THERAPY1. No role after the complete clinical response 2. Drugs used: 3month or 12month paclitaxel every 28days

Question: An 6 cm simple ovarian cyst was identified in late pregnancy, what would be the best management ?:
A. Emergency laparotomy
B. Removal after after 6 weeks of puerperium
C. Removal early in the puerperium
D. Conservative as most tumors would subside
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Treatment of ovarian tumour in pregnancy depending on time of pregnancy: During pregnancy In an uncomplicated case, the best time of elective operation is b/w 14-18wks as chances of aboion are less and access to the pedicle is easy. But if the tumour is diagnosed beyond 36 weeks, tumour is removed early in puerperium. During labour If the tumour is above the presenting pa watchful expectancy is followed but if its impacted in pelvis, caesarian section should be done followed by removal of tumour in same setting. During puerperium The tumour should be removed as early in puerperium as possible because the longer is the wait for the surgery, there is more chance of having the tumor undergo a torsion

Question: After a normal prenatal period, a lady developed sudden HTN and bleeding from all places. Diagnosis is:
A. DIC
B. Aplastic anemia
C. ITP
D. APLA
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: (A) DIC# Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), also known as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy or less commonly as consumptive coagulopathy, is a pathological process characterized by the widespread activation of the clotting cascade that results in the formation of blood clots in the small blood vessels throughout the body. This leads to compromise of tissue blood flow and can ultimately lead to multiple organ damage. In addition, as the coagulation process consumes clotting factors and platelets, normal clotting is disrupted and severe bleeding can occur from various sites.> DIC can occur in the following conditions: Solid tumors and blood cancers (particularly acute promyelocytic leukemia) Obstetric complications: abruptio placentae, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, amniotic fluid embolism, retained intrauterine fetal demise, septic abortion, post partum haemorrhage Massive tissue injury: severe trauma, burns, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, extensive surgery Sepsis or Severe infection of any kind (infections by nearly all microorganisms can cause DIC, though bacterial infections are the most common): bacterial (Gram-negative and Gram-positive sepsis), viral, fungal, or protozoan infections Transfusion reactions (i.e., ABO incompatibility haemolytic reactions) Severe allergic or toxic reactions (i.e. snake or viper venom) Giant haemangiomas (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome) Large aortic aneurysms> Liver disease, HELLP syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/Haemolytic uremic syndrome, and malignant hypertension may mimic DIC but do not occur via the same pathways.
