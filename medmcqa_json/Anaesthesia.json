    "explanation": "The initial, and often definitive, management of hyponatremia is free-water restriction. Symptomatic hyponatremia, which occurs at serum sodium levels less than or equal to 120 mEq/L, can result in headache, seizures, coma, and signs of increased intracranial pressure and may require infusion of hypeonic saline. Rapid correction should be avoided so as not to cause central pontine myelinolysis, manifested by neurologic symptoms ranging from seizures to brain damage and death. Additionally, a search for the underlying etiology of the hyponatremia should be undeaken. Acute severe hyponatremia sometimes occurs following elective surgical procedures due to a combination of appropriate stimulation of antidiuretic hormone and injudicious administration of excess free water in the first few postoperative days. Other potential etiologies include hyperosmolarity with free-water shifts from the intra- to the extracellular compament (eg, hyperglycemia), sodium depletion (eg, gastrointestinal or renal losses, insufficient intake), dilution (eg, drug-induced), and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)."

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "In the absence of peritoneal signs, angiography is the diagnostic test of choice for acute mesenteric ischemia. Patients with peritoneal signs should undergo emergent laparotomy. Acute mesenteric ischemia may be difficult to diagnose. The condition should be suspected in patients with either systemic manifestations of aeriosclerotic vascular disease or low cardiac-output states associated with a sudden development of abdominal pain that is out of propoion to the physical findings. Because of the risk of progression to small-bowel infarction, acute mesenteric ischemia is an emergency and timely diagnosis is essential. Although patients may have lactic acidosis or leukocytosis, these are late findings. Abdominal films are generally unhelpful and may show a nonspecific ileus pattern. Since the pathology involves the small bowel, a barium enema is not indicated. Upper gastrointestinal series and ultrasonography are also of limited value. CT scanning is a good initial test, but should still be followed by angiography in a patient with clinically suspected acute mesenteric ischemia, even in the absence of findings on the CT scan. In addition to establishing the diagnosis in this stable patient, angiography may also assist with operative planning and elucidation of the etiology of the acute mesenteric ischemia. The cause may be embolic occlusion or thrombosis of the superior mesenteric aery, primary mesenteric venous occlusion, or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia secondary to low-cardiac output states. A moality of 50% to 75% is repoed. The majority of affected patients are at high operative risk, but early diagnosis followed by revascularization or resectional surgery or both are the only hope for survival. Celiotomy must be performed once the diagnosis of aerial occlusion or bowel infarction has been made. Initial treatment of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia includes measures to increase cardiac output and blood pressure. Laparotomy should be performed if peritoneal signs develop"

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Etomidate Effects of Etomidate on cardiovascular systemEtomidate has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system.It causes mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance which may cause a slight decline in arterial blood pressure.Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol:The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in arterial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload).Propofol markedly impairs the normal arterial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload.Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental)The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, bas line autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease.Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure.Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in heart rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes.However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, b adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and arterial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression.Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular systemKetamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary artery pressure and myocardial work.Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms."

Most cannulae can only provide oxygen at low flow rates--up to 5 litres per minute (L/min)--delivering an oxygen concentration of 28-44%. Rates above 5 L/min can result in discomfo to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L/min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L/min. The nasal cannula is often used in elderly patients or patients who can benefit from oxygen therapy but do not require it to self respirate. These patients do not need oxygen to the degree of wearing a non-rebreather mask.

Volume cycled assist control mode of ventilation is the most commonly used mode of ventilation. Volume targeted modes deliver a preset volume unless a specified circuit pressure limit is exceeded. Its major advantages are capacity to deliver unvarying tidal volumes, flexibility of flow and volume adjustments, and power to ventilate difficult patients. Disadvantages of this type of ventilation are: Unless the airway is well sealed volume cycled modes cannot ventilate effectively and consistently. After the flow rate and profile are set the inflation time of machine is set and remains unresponsive to patients native cycling rythm and flow demands.

    "explanation": "Isoflurane is metabolized to trifluoroacetic acid. Although serum fluoride fluid levels may rise, nephrotoxicity is extremely unlikely, even in the presence of enzyme inducers. Prolonged sedation (>24 h at 0.1-0.6% isoflurane) of critically ill patients has resulted in elevated plasma fluoride levels (15-50 mmol/L) without evidence of kidney impairment. Similarly, up to 20 MAC-hours of isoflurane may lead to fluoride levels exceeding 50 mmol/L without detectable postoperative kidney dysfunction. Its limited oxidative metabolism also minimizes any possible risk of significant hepatic dysfunction. Total hepatic blood flow (hepatic aery and poal vein flow) may be reduced during isoflurane anesthesia. Hepatic oxygen supply is better-maintained with isoflurane than with halothane, however, because hepatic aery perfusion is preserved. Liver function tests are usually not affected. The major effect of acute inhalation of chloroform is central nervous system depression. At concentrations from 1,500-30,000 ppm, chloroform exposure can induce anesthesia; at concentrations exceeding 40,000 ppm, it can be fatal. Chronic inhalation of chloroform in humans results in hepatotoxicity and central nervous symptoms such as depression and irritability. Meanwhile, chronic oral exposure to chloroform in humans results in effects on the blood, livers, and kidneys. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e"

For example, radiation therapy, such as used for treatment of pelvic gynecologic and rectal malignancies, can result in chronic injury to the small intestine characterized by fibrosis and poor wound healing. High-output fistulas, defined as those with more than 500 cc per day output, are usually proximal and unlikely to close.

APRV applies CPAP (P high) for a prolonged time (T high) to maintain adequate lung volume and alveolar recruitment, with a time-cycled release phase to a lower set of pressure (P low) for a sho period of time (T low) or (release time) where most of ventilation and CO2 removal occurs Using high-flow (demand valve) CPAP circuit, unrestricted spontaneous breathing can be integrated and can happen any time regardless of the ventilator cycle. If the patient has no spontaneous respiratory effo, APRV becomes typical to 'inverse ratio pressure'-limited, 'time cycle'-assisted mechanical ventilation (pressure-controlled ventilation)."

However, acidosis and severe hypothermia decrease the rate of drug metabolism and should prompt dose reduction. Mivacurium is a sho-acting benzylisoquinoline with an onset of action comparable to atracurium but with one-third its duration of action, because of rapid hydrolysis by plasma pseudocholinesterase. However, patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency may have depressed pseudocholinesterase activity leading to delayed elimination. Vecuronium is an aminosteroid compound with an intermediate duration of action. It is hepatically metabolized to three active metabolites, all of which are eliminated by the kidney."

    "explanation": "Oliver Wendell Holmes coined the term anesthesia. In 1846, Holmes coined the word anesthesia. In a letter to dentist William T. G. Moon, the first practitioner to publicly demonstrate the use of ether during surgery, he wrote: \"Everybody wants to have a hand in a great discovery. All I will do is to give a hint or two as to names--or the name--to be applied to the state produced and the agent. The state should, I think, be called \"Anaesthesia.\" This signifies insensibility--more paicularly ... to objects of touch.\" Ether was used for frivolous purposes (\"ether frolics\"), but not as an anesthetic agent in humans until 1842, when Crawford W. Long and William E. Clark independently used it on patients for surgery and dental extraction, respectively. However, neither Long nor Clark publicized his discovery. Four years later, in Boston, on October 16, 1846, William T.G. Moon conducted the first publicized demonstration of general anesthesia for surgical operation using ether. The dramatic success of that exhibition led the operating surgeon to exclaim to a skeptical audience: \"Gentlemen, this is no humbug!\" Joseph Priestley produced nitrous oxide in 1772, and Humphry Davy first noted its analgesic propeies in 1800. Gardner Colton and Horace Wells are credited with having first used nitrous oxide as an anesthetic for dental extractions in humans in 1844.

Like atracurium, it undergoes degradation in plasma at physiological pH and temperature by organ-independent Hofmann elimination. The resulting metabolites (a monoquaternary acrylate and laudanosine) have no neuromuscular blocking effects. Because of cisatracurium's greater potency, the amount of laudanosine produced for the same extent and duration of neuromuscular blockade is much less than with atracurium. Nonspecific esterases are not involved in the metabolism of cisatracurium. Metabolism and elimination are independent of renal or liver failure hence can be given in hepatic and renal failure.

    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "C i.e. Ataracurium In pediatric patients the choice of non depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on side effects and duration of action. The method of excretion of atracurium and cisatracurium (Hofman elimination and ester hydrolysis) makes these relaxants paicularly useful in newborns and children with liver or renal diseaseQ. If tachycardia is desired (eg with fentanyl anesthesia), pancuronium would be an appropriate choice. Vecuronium, atracurium, rocuronium & cisatracurium are useful for shoer procedures. Rocuronium offers an advantage that it can be administered intramuscularly (like Sch) preferably in deltoid however, the duration of action is - 1 hour, which could be a distinct disadvantage for a brief procedure. Vecuronium is valuable because no histamine is released; however, its duration of action is prolonged in newborns, which makes it similar to pancuronium The potential for rhabdomyolysis & hyperkalemia (paicularly in boys < 8 yrs who may have unrecognized muscular dystrophy), as well as for masseter spasm (jaws of steel), malignant hypehermia, cardiac arrhythmias, and myoglobinemia after administration of succinyl choline suggests that Sch should not be used routinely in children. Unlike adult patients profound bradycardia & sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following 1st dose of Sch without atropine pretreatment. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following Sch administration, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Howeve, it is the only available ultrasho acting muscle relaxant that provides a dependable, rapid onset of action. IV use of Sch should be limited to children who have full stomach or to treat laryngospasm. Intramuscular, intralingual (Submental) use is indicated for children with difficult intravenous access when control of airway is deemed essential. Mivacurium is an alternative to Sch when profound neuromuscular block of sho duration is required but rapid onset of action is unnecessary. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade in all neonates & small infants, is recommended, even if they have recovered clinically, because any increase in work of breathing may cause fatigue and respiratory failure. Sugammadex, a cyclodextrin whose endoskeleton forms a water soluble complex with exoskeleton of rocuronium, is designed to antagonize the effects of rocuronium. As it is made of sugars and antagonize by covalent bonding the side effects are minimal. Antagonism is more rapid than neostigmine/atropine. It also reverse the other steroidal relaxants vecuronium & pancuronium to a lesser extent. The mechanism of reversal is lowering of plasma conentation & thus reversing the concentration gradient and pulling the rocuronium off the myoneural junction."

    "explanation": "Ans. C: Propofol Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, are widely used as sedative agents in the ICU. Diazepam use has become less common as newer shoer-acting benzodiazepines have become available. Lorazepam is more potent than midazolam and, because of its low lipid solubility, crosses the blood-brain barrier more slowly, delaying its onset of action and prolonging the sedative effect. Hence, it is recommended for longer-term sedation while midazolam is preferred for sho-term sedation Propofol, another frequently used sedative agent, resembles midazolam in terms of pharmacological profile. Midazolam and propofol have similar efficacy and safety in sedating various groups of critically ill patients. Midazolam is, however, cheaper than propofol Neveheless, propofol, when used as a sedative in mechanically ventilated patients, is associated with shoer weaning times and hence, while midazolam may be cheaper, the overall cost-benefit analysis taking into account duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay may in fact be better with propofol."

This decreases the volume of the epidural space and also the volume of the CSF per spinal segment. Therefore a given dose of epidural or intrathecal local anaesthetic will produce a greater degree of demiatomal involvement.\nPregnant women exhibit increase susceptibility to local anaesthetics.\n\n\nApex of lumbar lordosis cauded to thoracic kyphosis is reduced in supine position.

The endocrine system reacts by releasing an excessive amount of hormones, ultimately resulting in carbohydrate, protein, and fat catabolism (destruction); poor glucose use; and other harmful effects. This reaction combined with inflammatory processes can produce weight loss, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, fever, shock, and death. Unrelieved pain prolongs the stress response, adversely affecting the patient's recovery.> Cardiovascular system responds to stress of pain by activating the sympathetic nervous system, which produces a variety of unwanted effects.> In the postoperative period, these include hypercoagulation and increased heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac work load, and oxygen demand.> Aggressive pain control is required to reduce these effects and prevent thromboembolic complications.> Cardiac morbidity is the primary cause of death after anesthesia and surgery"

Although exercise stress testing is an appropriate method for evaluating a patient's cardiac function preoperatively, this patient's functional status is limited by his peripheral vascular disease and therefore a pharmacologic stress test would be the preferred method of cardiac evaluation. An ECG should be performed in this patient with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypeension, and diabetes, but a normal ECG would not preclude fuher workup.

Order of recovery is in reverse order.o Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure,o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all.o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated,o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres."

In contrast to phase II depolarization block & Non depolarizing block, phase I depolarization block does not exhibit fade during tetanus or train-of-four, neither does it demonstrate post tetanic potentiation. Phase I block is potentiated by isoflurane, Mg, Li & Anticholine-esterase while phase II block is potentiated by enflurane. - The onset of paralysis by succinylcholine is signaled by visible motor unit contractions called fasciculation.Q Patients who have received suxamethonium have an increased incidence of postoperative myalgiaQ. This is more common in healthy female outpatients. Pregnancy & extremes of age seem to be protective. Succinylcholine releases a metabolite succinylmonocholine, causing excitation of the cholinergic receptors in the sinoatrial node resulting in bradycardia.

However because of the risk associated with their use, infusion of banked blood or fresh frozen plasma cannot be recommended - Churchill. - Succinylcholine & mivacurium are metabolized by pseudocholinesterase, while esmolol and remifentanyl are metabolized by RBC es terase.(2 - Pseudo cholinesterase deficiency causes prolonged residual paralysis at normal Sch dose (1-2 mg/kg)Q whereas, phase 2 non-depolarization blockade occurs after administration of higher doses >6 (7-10) mg/kgQ Despite large decrease in pseudo cholinesterase activity (level) there is only moderate increase in duration of action of Sch. In contrast to the doubling or tripling of blockade duration seen in patients with low pseudo cholinesterase enzyme levels or hetozygous atypical enzyme, patients with homozygous atypical enzyme will have a very blockade (4-8 hrs) following Sch administration."

      "All"
    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "The infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks are an alternative to axillary block for anaesthetizing the elbow, forearm, and hand when positioning is compromised by limited abduction at the shoulder, for example, rheumatoid ahritis or an immobilized/traumatized arm. It is also an alternative to supraclavicular block for anaesthetizing the upper arm. The veical infraclavicular is better than the lateral approaches in this respect and has similar rates of pneumothorax but less frequent phrenic nerve paresis. The lateral approach performed with ultrasound control has a minimal risk of phrenic nerve paresis or pneumothorax and so may be a better choice in those with respiratory compromise, but provides less reliable upper arm anaesthesia. Complications are rare and less frequent than supraclavicular approaches and vary depending on the specific infraclavicular technique used. Although the axillary block provides safe and straightforward regional anaesthesia of the arm, the infraclavicular approach does offer an alternative in some specific situations and can be considered a ble routine alternative in experienced hands. It has some advantages in providing upper arm anaesthesia, securing infusion catheters to the chest wall, and ease of patient positioning"

Development of methemoglobinemia is dependent on the total dose administered, usually appearing after a dose of 8 mg/kg. Methemoglobinemia is more common in neonates due to decreased resistance of fetal hemoglobin to oxidant stresses and the immaturity of enzymes in the neonate that conve methemoglobin back to the ferrous state.

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. b. Prevented by giving warm fluids Hypothermia during anesthesia can be prevented by giving warm fluids. Hypothermia During Anesthesia Mild hypothermia is extremely common during anesthesia and surgery. The physiological effects of hypothermia may have significant potential for detrimental effects on patient well-being. Major consequences of inadveent hypothermia include morbid myocardial events, reduced resistance to surgical wound infection, impaired coagulation, delayed recovery, and postoperative shivering. Heat loss occurs primarily from the skin of a patient to the environment through several processes, including radiation, conduction and convection, and evaporation. Of these, radiation is most significant and accounts for --60% of total heat loss. Drug metabolism can be markedly decreased by hypothermia. Although hypothermia is generally regarded as deleterious, it can be beneficial in some situations. Hypothermia decreases the overall metabolic rate by 8% per degC to about half the normal rate at 28degC. Oxygen demand drops and those tissues that have high oxygen consumption normally, such as brain and hea, have a propoionally greater reduction of oxygen use. This allows aerobic metabolism to continue through greater periods of compromised oxygen supply, thereby reducing the production of anaerobic byproducts such as superoxide radicals and lactate. Hypothermia During Anesthesia Hypothermia lowers intracranial pressures and cerebral perfusion pressure. Warming of fluids can only help to minimize heat loss. Warm fluids are probably of benefit only when large amounts are administered for fluid replacement."

An electrocardiogram therefore provides a rapid means of differentiating between hypocalcemia (prolonged QT interval, T-wave inversion, hea blocks) and hypomagnesemia (prolonged QT and PR intervals, ST segment depression, flattening or inversion of p waves, torsade de pointes). Hypomagnesemia also causes potassium wasting by the kidney. Many hospital patients with refractory hypocalcemia will be found to be magnesium deficient. Often this deficiency becomes manifest during the response to parenteral nutrition when normal cellular ionic gradients are restored. A normal blood pH and aerial PCO2 rule out hyperventilation. The serum calcium in this patient is normal when adjusted for the low albumin (add 0.8 mg/dL per 1 g/dL decrease in albumin). Hypomagnesemia causes functional hypoparathyroidism, which can lower serum calcium and thus result in a combined defect."

Voltage - gated Na channels exist in three stages - resting, open and inactivated local anesthetics bind a specific region of the & subunit and inhibit voltage - gated Na channels preventing channel activation and Na influx associated with membrane depolarization. Main mechanism of action of local anesthetics is through inhibition ofActivated, voltage-gated Na channel. Local anesthetics have a greater affinity for the channel in the open or inactivated state than in the resting state. Local anesthetic binding to open or inactivated channels, or both, is facilitated by depolarization. The fraction of Na channels that have bound a local anesthetic increases with frequent depolarization (eg, during trains of impulses).This phenomenon is termed use-dependent block Local anesthetic inhibition is both voltage and frequency dependent, and is greater when nerve fibers are firing rapidly than with infrequent depolarizations Sodium passess through voltage gated sodium channel and cause change in membrane potential and cause depolarization. Local anesthetic attaches to sodium channel and prevents propogation & depolarization"

So renal failure doesn't affect the clearance of cis atracurium. Hence it is the agent of choice in renal failure patients. Atracurium also undergo Hofmann elimination and so is an alternative to cis atracurium in renal failure. Steroidal muscle relaxants are predominantly eliminated by ultrafiltration by the glomeruli before urinary excretion. Doxacurium, pancuronium, and pipecuronium are paially excreted by the kidneys, and so the neuromuscular block is prolonged in patients with renal failure."

    "explanation": "The cause of malignant hypehermia is unknown, but it is associated with inhalational anesthetic agents and succinylcholine. It may develop in an otherwise healthy person who has tolerated previous surgery without incident. It should be suspected in the presence of a history of unexplained fever, muscle or connective tissue disorder, or a positive family history (evidence suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern). In addition to fever during anesthesia, the syndrome includes tachycardia, increased O2 consumption, increased CO2 production, increased serum K+ , myoglobinuria, and acidosis. Rigidity rather than relaxation following succinylcholine injection may be the first clue to its presence. Treatment of malignant hypehermia should include prompt conclusion of the operative procedure and cessation of anesthesia, hyperventilation with 100% O2 , and administration of intravenous dantrolene. The urine should be alkalinized to protect the kidneys from myoglobin precipitation. If reoperation is necessary, the physician should premedicate heavily, alkalinize the urine, and avoid depolarizing agents such as succinylcholine. Pretreatment for 24 hours with dantrolene is helpful; it is thought to act directly on muscle fiber to attenuate calcium release."

    ],
    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Central chemoreceptors are situated in the deeper pa of medulla oblongata, close to the dorsal respiratory group of neurons. This area is known as a chemosensitive area, and the neurons are called chemoreceptors. Chemoreceptors are in close contact with blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Central chemoreceptors are connected with respiratory centers, paicularly the dorsal respiratory group of neurons through synapses. These chemoreceptors act slowly but effectively. Central chemoreceptors are responsible for 70% to 80% of increased ventilation through chemical regulatory mechanisms. Main stimulant for central chemoreceptors is the increased hydrogen ion concentration. However, if hydrogen ion concentration increases in the blood, it cannot stimulate the central chemoreceptors because the hydrogen ions from blood cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. On the other hand, if carbon dioxide increases in the blood, it can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier and enter the interstitial fluid of the brain or the cerebrospinal fluid. There, carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid. Since carbonic acid is unstable, it immediately dissociates into hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion. CO2 + H2O - H2CO3 - H+ + HCO3- Hydrogen ions stimulate the central chemoreceptors. From chemoreceptors, the excitatory impulses are sent to the dorsal respiratory group of neurons, resulting in increased ventilation (increased rate and force of breathing). Because of this, excess carbon dioxide is washed out and respiration is brought back to normal. Lack of oxygen does not have a significant effect on the central chemoreceptors, except that it generally depresses the overall function of the brain. Ref: Sembulingam - physiology 7th edition"

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "Bupivacaine is a widely used amide local anesthetic. It is a potent agent capable of producing prolonged anesthesia. Its long duration of action plus its tendency to provide more sensory than motor block has made it a popular drug for providing prolonged analgesia during labor or the postoperative period. By taking advantage of indwelling catheters and continuous infusions, bupivacaine can be used to provide several days of effective analgesia. Lignocaine, tetracaine, and cocaine are used as local anaesthetics and anesthesia lasts for 30-45 minutes (30-60 minutes with tetracaine). Anesthesia is entirely superficial; it does not extend to submucosal structures. Ref: Catterall W.A., Mackie K. (2011). Chapter 20. Local Anesthetics. In L.L. Brunton, B.A. Chabner, B.C.

MH may occasionally present more than an hour after emergence from an anesthetic, and rarely may occur without exposure to known triggering agents. Most cases have been repoed in young males; almost none have been repoed in infants, and few have been repoed in the elderly. Neveheless, all ages and both sexes may be affected. The incidence of MH varies significantly from country to country and even among different geographic localities within the same country, reflecting varying gene pools. The upper Midwest appears to have the greatest incidence of MH in the United States. Anesthetic drugs that trigger MH include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and depolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used.

An isobaric solution has a baricity of 1 and tends to remain in the immediate area of injection. A ratio < 1 is a hypobaric solution, which rises in the CSF."

These effects may produce premature ventricular contractions and arrhythmias originating from the His bundle. Intact sinoatrial node function reduces the incidence of epinephrine induced ventricular escape during halothane anesthesia and is protective against His bundle arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, other volatile anesthetics sensitize the myocardium to the arrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine. Sensitization is the interaction between volatile anesthetics and catecholamines that leads to reductions in the threshold for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, isoflurane may be arrhythmogenic in Purkinje fibers in experimental myocardial infarction by facilitating reentrant activity or increasing temporal dispersion of the refractory period recovery.

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "Somatosensory evoked potential (SEP or SSEP) is the electrical activity of the brain that results from the stimulation of touch. SEP tests measure that activity and are a useful, noninvasive means of assessing somatosensory system functioning. By combining SEP recordings at different levels of the somatosensory pathways, it is possible to assess the transmission of the afferent volley from the periphery up to the coex. SEP components include a series of positive and negative deflections that can be elicited by viually any sensory stimuli. For example, SEPs can be obtained in response to a brief mechanical impact on the fingeip or to air puffs. However, SEPs are most commonly elicited by bipolar transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied on the skin over the trajectory of peripheral nerves of the upper limb (e.g., the median nerve) or lower limb (e.g., the posterior tibial nerve), and then recorded from the scalp. In general, somatosensory stimuli evoke early coical components (N25, P60, N80), generated in the contralateral primary somatosensory coex (S1), related to the processing of the physical stimulus attributes. About 100 ms after stimulus application, additional coical regions are activated, such as the secondary somatosensory coex (S2), and the posterior parietal and frontal coices, marked by a parietal P100 and bilateral frontal N140. SEPs are routinely used in neurology today to confirm and localize sensory abnormalities, to identify silent lesions and to monitor changes during surgical procedures. It is done mostly under General Anaesthesia to monitor neural pathway."

    "explanation": "Life threatening cardiovascular toxicity, including left ventricular depression, atrioventricular hea block,ventricular arrhythmia is seen more in patients with deceased liver function, acidosis and in shock. The risk factors for developing LAST (Local Anesthetic systemic toxicity)can be categorized into those that are related to the injected drug, the patient, or the technique. Drug The cardiovascular collapse/CNS (CC/CNS) ratio is \"the ratio of drug dose required to cause catastrophic cardiovascular collapse to the drug dose required to produce seizures.\" A low CC/CNS ratio is associated with more cardiotoxic agents, while LAs with a higher CC/CNS ratio have a greater safety margin. This is because the earlier presentation of CNS features may expedite earlier diagnosis (and thus, treatment) of LAST before cardiovascular collapse ensues. Ropivacaine and levobupivacaine, for example, have higher CC/CNS ratios than racemic bupivacaine; therefore, it seems logical to preferentially use these drugs when long-acting LAs are desired. Vigilance is always required, however, as all LA drugs may cause LAST. Patient Age Patients at the extremes of age have consistently been shown to be at the greatest risk of LAST. Pregnancy Renal disease Patients with severe renal disease not only have a hyperdynamic circulation and reduced clearance of LAs, but also have an increased a1-acid glycoprotein concentration. As a result, free plasma concentrations are largely unchanged and dose reduction is often unnecessary, unless the patient is uremic with metabolic acidosis. Cardiac disease Dose reduction is unnecessary in mild-moderate hea failure where tissue perfusion is preserved, but is recommended in severe hea failure. Hepatic dysfunction"

Mode of action The effects of succinylcholine (SCh)at the neuromuscular junction are depolarizing postsynaptic and extrajunctional receptors, normally, this desensitization process does not occur with acetylcholine because of its rapid breakdown. However, succinylcholine remains at the endplate for much longer, so desensitization develops after a brief period of activation. Neuromuscular blockade because a depolarized neuro muscular blockade cannot respond to subsequent acetylcholine release. SCh is endowed with two unique and critically impoant characteristics - 1.produces intense paralysis rapidly(fastest onset) 2.effect wanes before preoxygenated person beomes hypoxic (shoest duration). Within 1 minute after succinylcholine injection and before paralysis are manifested, disorganized movements or fasciculation is seen. Characteristics of blockade 1. Simple twitch height reduces 2.

The common manifestations of these reactions, which vary in severity and classification, are vivid dreaming, extracorporeal experiences (sense of floating out of body), and illusions (misinterpretation of a real, external sensory experience). These incidents of dreaming and illusion are often associated with excitement, confusion, euphoria, and fear. They occur in the first hour of emergence and usually abate within 1 to several hours. These psychic emergence reactions are secondary to ketamine-induced depression of auditory and visual relay nuclei, thus leading to misperception or misinterpretation of auditory and visual stimuli.

Themaximum oxygen concentrationachievable to be delivered to the patient, and the reliability/ variability with which the devices do that. Looking at the reliability and variability of oxygen delivery to the patient we can divide these pieces of equipment intofixed performance or variable performance devices. This means that the achieved inspired oxygen concentration is either more dependent on thepatient'speak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR)(variableperformance devices) or less so (fixedperformance devices). Fixed performance devices These devices deliver a fixed inspired oxygen concentration to the patient, independent of the PIFR. Even at the time of PIFR no random entrainment of room air will occur to unpredictably alter the FiO2 with this equipment. Devices in this group include: SS Venturi mask Thereisentrainment of room air with these devices, but it is fixed and not dependent on the patient's PIFR. Therefore the resulting delivered FiO2 is also constant. SS Non-rebreather facemask A reservoir bag supplies 100% oxygen and makes up for the deficit which occurs during times when the patient's PIFR is higher than the oxygen supply flow to the mask (usually around 20 L/min from an oxygen wall or tank source). Aflap valveon the mask prevent or at least reduce entrainment of room air. These masks do not achieve a perfect seal with the patient's face, sosomeroom air entrainment still occurs. FiO2 up to 70-80% can be achieved. SS Anesthetic facemask(with an anesthetic breathing circuit) These masks form a complete seal around the patient's airway so no entrainment of room air can occur. The delivered oxygen concentration is the same as in the gas mixture supplied to the mask (assuming no rebreathing occurs in the anesthetic breathing cicuit). We have also listed thePatil-Syracuseand theendoscopy maskunder this heading. Both of these devices allow instrumentation with a fiberoptic scope while maintaining a seal to the face with the mask. 2. Variable performance devices These devices deliver a variable inspired oxygen concentration to the patient, which depends on the PIFR. Depending on a patient's inspiratory effo (tidal volume, 'speed' of inspiration and respiratory rate) the PIFR can often exceed the flow rate at which oxygen or an oxygen/air mixture is supplied by the device, meaning that at the time of PIFR more or less entrainment of room air occurs, altering the resulting FiO2 in an unpredictable fashion Devices in this group are: SS Nasal cannulas Simple facemask/ 'Hudson' mask"

    ],
    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "The first modern halogenated volatile anesthetic, halothane, was introduced in 1955. Clinical exposure to halothane is associated with two distinct types of hepatic injury. Subclinical hepatotoxicity occurs in 20% of adults who receive halothane. It is characterized by mild postoperative elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspaate aminotransferase, but is reversible and innocuous. Anaerobic halothane reduction by CYP2A6 to a 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethyl radical is thought to mediate this mild hepatic injury. The fulminant form of hepatotoxicity, commonly known as halothane hepatitis, It is characterized by elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspaate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, and massive hepatic necrosis following the administration of halothane. Halothane hepatitis is rare (1 in 5000 to 35,000 administrations in adults), but is fatal in 50% to 75% of these cases. Because of the potential for fatal hepatitis, halothane is no longer used in adult patients in many countries. Halothane hepatitis is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane. The highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane oxidation can react with nearby liver proteins. In most patients who developed hepatic necrosis after halothane anesthesia, antibodies against TFA-modified proteins were detected, suggesting that the hepatic damage is linked to an immune response against the modified protein, which acts as a neoantigen. Accordingly, patients who develop halothane hepatitis often have a history of prior exposures to halothane or other volatile anesthetics, together with symptoms suggestive of immune reactivity, such as fever, rash, ahralgia, and eosinophilia. A current hypothesis is that TFA-protein adducts induce a cytotoxic T cell reaction in sensitized individuals, which leads to liver damage. However, the immune responses observed in halothane hepatitis might not mediate liver injury. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e"

    "explanation": "Ans. C: Ketamine Ketamine is classified as an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspaate) receptor antagonist, and at high, fully anesthetic level doses, ketamine has also been found to bind to opioid (mu) receptors and sigma receptors. Like other drugs of this class such as tiletamine and phencyclidine (PCP), it induces a state referred to as \"dissociative anaesthesia\" and is used as a recreational drug. Ketamine has a wide range of effects in humans, including analgesia, anaesthesia, hallucinations, elevated blood pressure, and bronchodilation. It is primarily used for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, usually in combination with some sedative drug. Ketamine is usually injected intravenously or intramuscularly, but it is also effective when insufflated, smoked, or taken orally. When used at anaesthetic doses, it will usually stimulate rather than depress the circulatory system, so I/ V anaesthetic of choice for shock. Ketainine produces a dissociative state, characterised by a sense of detachment from one's physical body and the external world which is known as depersonalization and derealization. At sufficiently high doses users may experience what is coined the \"K-hole\", a state of dissociation whose effects are thought to mimic the phenomenology of schizophrenia."

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "The work of Goldman and others has served to identify risk factors for perioperative myocardial infarction. The highest likelihood is associated with recent myocardial infarction: the more recent the event, the higher the risk up to 6 months. It should be noted, however, that the risk never returns to normal. A non-Q-wave infarction may not have destroyed much myocardium, but it leaves the surrounding area with borderline perfusion, thus the paicularly high risk of subsequent perioperative infarction. Evidence of congestive hea failure, such as jugular venous distention, or S3 gallop also carries a high risk, as does the frequent occurrence of ectopic beats. Old age (>70 years) and emergency surgery are risk factors independent of these others. Coronary revascularization by coronary aery bypass graft (CABG) tends to protect against myocardial infarction. Smoking, diabetes, hypeension, and hyperlipidemia (all of which predispose to coronary aery disease) are surprisingly not independent risk factors, although they may increase the death rate should an infarct occur. The value of this information and data derived from fuher testing is that it identifies the patient who needs to be monitored invasively with a systemic aerial catheter and pulmonary aerial catheter. Most perioperative infarcts occur postoperatively when the third-space fluids return to the circulation, which increases the preload and the myocardial oxygen consumption. This generally occurs around the third postoperative day."

    "explanation": "Ans. c. Redistribution of the drug from sites in the CNSAn IV anesthetic completely bypasses the process of absorption, because the drug is placed directly into the bloodstream. Highly perfused organs (vessel rich) including the brain take up disproportionately large amount of drug compared to less perfused areas (the muscle, fat, and vessel-poor groups).Drugs bound to plasma proteins are unavailable for uptake by an organ.After the highly perfused organs are saturated during initial distribution, the greater mass of the less perfused organs continue to take up drug from the bloodstream.As plasma concentration falls, some drug leaves the highly perfused organs to maintain equilibrium.This redistribution from the vessel-rich group is responsible for termination of effect of many anesthetic drugs."

Anesthetic facemasks can therefore be used to deliver non-invasive ventilation (NIV). In order to ventilate with an anesthetic facemask you'll need a pressurized gas source (anesthesia gas supplies)such as a cylinder or gas wall supply. If no pressurized gas source is available, a self-inflating bag will allow for positive pressure-ventilation through an anesthetic facemask. The cuff volume can typically be adjusted through a valve. A somewhat under-inflated cuff usually achieves a better seal than a fully inflated one. Most manufacturers supply these masks with a detachable hook ring, which allows for the mask to be held in place with a head strap for delivering NIV.

Xe naturally occurs in the atmosphere in trace amounts (1:11.5 million ) and is extracted from liquefied air by sequential cryogenic fractional distillation. Thus, Xe does not affect the ozone layer, unlike N2O and volatile anesthetics. This latter effect may be paicularly impoant because currently used inhaled anesthetics have been identified as strong greenhouse gases that contribute to total anthropogenic radiative forcing of global climate change. Xe is expensive to produce because of its rarity; only a finite amount is available for use as a general anesthetic. Total world production of Xe is estimated to be approximately 9 to 12 million liters per year. Despite its relative scarcity and high production costs, Xe was approved for clinical use in Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom during the past decade. Unlike volatile anesthetics and N2O, which produce diverse hemodynamic actions in the absence or presence of hea disease, Xe is essentially devoid of major cardiovascular effects. For example, Xe did not alter the amplitudes of Na+, L-type Ca2+, and inward-rectifier K+ channel currents over a range of voltages in the isolated cardiac myocyte nor did the anesthetic noble gas affect indices of cardiac function in a Langendorff hea preparation. Systemic hemodynamics were unchanged and recovery from anesthesia was faster in patients who received 60% Xe-O2 compared with 60% N2O-0.5% isoflurane during elective surgery. Similarly, mean aerial pressure was maintained at conscious values during Xe-remifentanil but not propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in another study of patients undergoing elective surgery.

    "explanation": "The nerve resting membrane potential is little affected by local anesthetics. As the concentration of local anesthetic applied to the nerve is increased, a decrease in the rate of depolarization and in the peak amplitude of the action potential occurs until the impulse is abolished. It is not possible, however, to derive data on the binding of local anesthetics to Na+ channels from measurement of the changes in nerve impulses. By using a \"voltage-clamp\" procedure, Na+ currents and their inhibition by local anesthetics can be directly assayed. When the membrane of isolated neurons is rapidly depolarized to a constant value, the time course of ionic currents is observed. Sodium currents during one initial depolarization are reduced by subclinical doses of local anesthetic (e.g., 0.2mM lidocaine) and totally abolished by clinical doses (e.g., 1% lidocaine, [?]40mM). If the test depolarization is applied repeatedly, for example, at frequencies higher than 5Hz (five pulses per second), the paially depressed (tonically inhibited) Na+ current is fuher reduced incrementally for each pulse until a new steady-state level of inhibition is reached. This frequency-dependent inhibition, also called phasic inhibition. Local anesthetics bind in the inner vestibule of the closed Na+ channel. Amino acid mutations in the S6 segments of D-1, D-3, and D-4 all modify local anesthetic action, thus suggesting either that these regions form a pharmacophore small enough to simultaneously contact the drug at three surfaces or that the local anesthetic molecule moves rapidly among these three segments.

Clinical manifestations 1. CNS manifestations These are the most common manifestations of toxicity. CNS lidocaine toxicity is biphasic Earlier manifestations-are due to CNS excitation e.g. convulsions Subsequent manifestations -are due to CNS depression drowsiness, disorientation, respiratory depression. The cause of biphasic response is Local anaesthetic action first blocks inhibitary CNS pathways-resulting in stimulation Eventually blocks both inhibitory and excitatory pathways- overall CNS depression 2. Cardiovascular manifestations These occur at higher serum concentrations There may be cardiac depression, hypotension, coma, respiratory arrest. Note: lignocaine can precipitate malignant hypehermia Management of toxicity If lignocaine toxicity is suspected, stop the injection immediately. Ensure adequate oxygenation, whether by face mask or by intubation. Anticonvulsants such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are the drug of choice for seizure control. Succinykholine is sometimes also used to terminate the neuromuscular effects of seizures. If CVS symptoms occur (cardiac depression and hypotension), IVfluid and vasopressor agents may be required.

It is the backward continuation of the nerve fibre layer of the retina, which consists of the second order neurons i.e., axon originating from the ganglion cells. It also contains the afferent fibres of the papillary light reflex. Morphologically and embryologically, the optic nerve is comparable to a sensory tract. Unlike peripheral nerves it is not covered by neurilemma (so it does not regenerate when cut). The fibres of optic nerve, numbering about a million, are very fine (2-10 m in diameter as compared to 20 mm of sensory nerves). Optic nerve is about 47-50 mm in length and can be divided into 4 pas : ? Intraocular pa (1 mm) : - It begins at optic disc (optic nerve head) and exits the nerve through a hole in sclera that is occupied by a mesh like structure called the lamina cribrosa. The nerve fibres from the retina leave the eye through pores (holes) in lamina cribrosa, a sieve-like structure made up of collagen meshwork. Intraorbital pa (30 mm) : - Extends from back of the eyeball (at lamina cribrosa) to the optic foramina. Intracanalicular pa (6-9 mm) : - It lies within the optic canal and closely related to ophthalmic aery which crosses obliquely over it. Intracranial pa (10 mm) : - It lies above the cavernous sinus and converges with its fellow from contralateral side to form optic chiasma. Like other pas of CNS, the optic nerve is covered by meningeal sheaths (Pia, archnoid and dura mater) as soon as the nerve leaves the eyeball."

Harrisons, Medicine, 18th/735)SPINAL ANESTHESIA# The term \"spinal anesthesia\" was coined in 1885 by Leonard Corning.Technique of spinal anesthesia:# In spinal anaesthesia the spinal needle is pierced upto subarachnoid space where the anaesthetic agent is injected to produce the anaesthesia.# The selected level should be below LI in an adult and L3 in a child to avoid needle trauma to the spinal cord. As an anatomic landmark, the L3-L4 interspace is located at the line intersecting the top of the iliac crests. Either a midline or paramedian approach can be used.# The anatomic layers passed through include skin, subcutaneous structures, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, dura mater, and arachnoid membrane.# Once the needle tip is believed to be in the subarachnoid space, the stylet is removed to see if CSF appears at the needle hub. With small diameter needles (26 to 29 gauge) this generally requires 5 to 10 seconds, but may require >1 minute in some patients. Gentle aspiration may speed the appearance of CSF. If CSF does not appear, the needle orifice may be obstructed by a nerve root and rotating the needle 90 degrees may result in CSF flow. Alternatively, the needle orifice may not be completely in the subarachnoid space and advancing an additional 1 to 2 mm may result in brisk CSF flow. This is particularly true of pencil-point needles, which have their orifice on the side of the needle shaft proximal to the needle tip.# Finally, failure to obtain CSF suggests that the needle orifice is not in the subarachnoid space and the needle should be reinserted.# Common complications include hypotension, bradycardia, increased sensitivity to sedative medications, nausea and vomiting (possibly secondary to hypotension), postdural puncture headache, nerve injury, total spinal, and hematoma/abscess formation at the site of puncture.# Total spinal anesthesia results from local anesthetic depression of the cervical spinal cord and brain stem. Signs and symptoms include dysphonia, dyspnea, upper extremity weakness, loss of consciousness, pupillary dilation, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Eaily recognition is the key to management. Treatment includes securing the airway, mechanical ventilation, volume infusion, and pressor support.# Absolute contraindications include local infection at the puncture site, bacteremia, severe hypovolemia, coagulopathy, severe stenotic valvular disease, infection at the site of the procedure, and intracranial hypertension. Relative contraindications include progressive degenerative (demyelinating) neurologic disease (multiple sclerosis), low back pain, and sepsis.# Intrathecal opioids:- Opioids produce intense visceral analgesia and may prolong sensory blockade without affecting motor or sympathetic function.- Fentanyl and sufentanil have a rapid onset of action and an effective duration greater than 6 hours.- Morphine lasts 6-24 hours.- Side effects include respiratory depression (which may occur late with hydrophilic agents), nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention."

It may occur instantaneously even during the procedure (e.g. spinal)Q. Pallor, nausea and (neurocardiogenic) bradycardia or asystole are a/w hypotension and fainting. Rapid resolution results from placing the patient in head down position and administration of iv ephedrine or atropine. Systemic toxicity - If large amount of LA reach the tissues of hea and brain they exe the same membrane stabilizing effect as on nerve resulting in progressive depression of function. The earliest feature is numbness or tingling of tongue and circumoral area; b/o rich blood supply to these tissue depositing enough drug to have an effect on nerve endings. The patient may beome light headed, anxious, drowsy and or complain of tinnitus. Convulsions, loss of consciousness, coma and apnoea may develop subsequently. Cardiovascular collapse may result from direct myocardial depression and vasodilation or hypoxemia d/t apnoea. - The most ommon cause is accidental intravascular injectionQ but it may also result from absolute overdose during blocks. System absorption of LA is greatest after intercostal nerve block and caudal anesthesia; intermediate after epidural anesthesia > brachial plexus > sciatic & femoral nerve block; and least after infiltration anesthesia."

Local anesthetic binding to Na channels does not alter the resting membrane potential. With increasing local anesthetic concentrations, an increasing fraction of the Na channels in the membrane bind a local anesthetic molecule and cannot conduct Na ions. As a consequence, impulse conduction slows, the rate of rise and the magnitude of the action potential decrease, and the threshold for excitation and impulse conduction increases progressively. At high enough local anesthetic concentrations and with a sufficient fraction of local anesthetic-bound Na channels, an action potential can no longer be generated and impulse propagation is abolished.

They are usually due to blunt trauma caused by a large object such as a cricket ball, human fist etc. o Most commonly the orbital floor blows, but it can also affect the medial wall of the orbit. The most common site for a blowout fracture to occur is the posteromedial aspect of the orbital floor, medial to the infraorbital neurovascular bundle where the maxillary bone is very thin. Lamina papyracea is also thin and the medial orbital wall is also prone to fracture. Although the lamina papyracea is thinner than the maxilla, the existence of ethmoid air cells reinforce the medial wall like corrugated paper or a beehive. The orbital floor overlies the maxillary sinus without reinforcement, therefore is weaker and more blowouts tend to occur here especially in the posteromedial floor (near the infraorbital groove), where it is the weakest area. Fracture of the floor causes the orbital contents to collapse into the maxillary sinus, causing enophthalmos and entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle. Blowout fractures are divided into pure and impure. The term pure orbital blowout fracture is used to describe a fracture of the orbital floor, the medial orbital floor or both, with an intact bony orbital margin. The term impure orbital blowout fracture is used when such fractures occur in combination with a fracture of the orbital rim."

In comparison to spinal anesthesia, the volume of drug given is larger, onset on effect is delayed (5-20 min) and duration of action is prolongedQ in epidural anesthesia. Both epidural & spinal anesthesia block sympathetic outflow (T12 - L2). This produces dilation of resistance and capacitance vessels decreasing venous return & causing hypo-tensionQ. However, this fall is sudden & profound in spinal anesthesia, whereas slower & profound in epidural anesthesia. Centrineuraxial (spinal & epidural) anesthesia is contraindicated in coagulopathy, blood dyscariasis, full anticoagulant (oral warfarin, LMVV heparin & fibrinolytic) therapy but can be given to patients on antiplatelet agents like aspirin & NSAIDs."

      "None"
    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Xenon has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and produces rapid induction of and emergence from anesthesia. Xe is not teratogenic, does not undergo biotransformation, and exes anesthetic and analgesic effects under normal atmospheric pressure conditions (1.0 MAC = 71%). Xe is derived from a paicle decay of radioactive heavy metals such as uranium and thorium. Xe naturally occurs in the atmosphere in trace amounts (1:11.5 million ) and is extracted from liquefied air by sequential cryogenic fractional distillation. Thus, Xe does not affect the ozone layer, unlike N2O and volatile anesthetics. This latter effect may be paicularly impoant because currently used inhaled anesthetics have been identified as strong greenhouse gases that contribute to total anthropogenic radiative forcing of global climate change. Xe is expensive to produce because of its rarity; only a finite amount is available for use as a general anesthetic. Total world production of Xe is estimated to be approximately 9 to 12 million liters per year. Despite its relative scarcity and high production costs, Xe was approved for clinical use in Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom during the past decade. Unlike volatile anesthetics and N2O, which produce diverse hemodynamic actions in the absence or presence of hea disease, Xe is essentially devoid of major cardiovascular effects.15,332 For example, Xe did not alter the amplitudes of Na+, L-type Ca2+, and inward-rectifier K+ channel currents over a range of voltages in the isolated cardiac myocyte nor did the anesthetic noble gas affect indices of cardiac function in a Langendorff hea preparation. Systemic hemodynamics were unchanged and recovery from anesthesia was faster in patients who received 60% Xe-O2 compared with 60% N2O-0.5% isoflurane during elective surgery. Similarly, mean aerial pressure was maintained at conscious values during Xe-remifentanil but not propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in another study of patients undergoing elective surgery.

    "explanation": "Hypotension The most common complication of celiac plexus is postural hypotension which is largely due to blockade of the lumbar sympathetic chain. Celiac plexus The celiac plexus is situated retroperitoneally in the upper abdomen. It is at the level of T12 and L1 veebrae, anterior to the crura of the diaphragm. It is the main junction for autonomic nerves supplying the upper abdominal organs (Liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, pancreas, kidneys, small bowel and 2/3 of the large bowel). The ganglia lie on each side of LI (aoa lying posteriorly, pancreas anteriorly and inferior venacava laterally). The plexus is composed of network of neve fibres from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Sympathetic supply :? It contains two large ganglia that receive sympathetic fibres from three splanchnic nerves - Greater splanchnic nerves (TIT, to TIT() - Lesser splanchnic nerves (Tio/T,,) - Least splanchnic nerves (Tii/T,2) Parasympathetic supply - From the left and right vagal trunks which pass through the celiax plexus but do not connect there. Technique The block is performed using X-ray screening, intravenous sedation, local anaesthetic infiltration of the superficial layers with the patient in the prone position. Indications of celiac plexus block For releief of pain from nonpelvic intraabdominal organs. Acute pain - may be performed during surgery for postoperative pain relief. Chronic pain - useful for any condition that causes chronic severe upper abdominal visceral pain e.g. chronic pancreatitis (local anaesthetic blocks only). Cancer pain - useful for upper abdominal organ cancer pain and is frequently used for carcinoma of the pancreas Complications of coeliac plexus block:- Ohostatic hypotension :? This is the most common complication of coeliac plexus block. It is more common when retrocrural pr splanchnic technique was used. Treatment includes resting in bed, avoiding changes in position and replacing fluids. Once compensatory vascular reflexes are fully activated this side effect disappears. Backache It results from retroperitoneal hematoma which is formed due to local trauma. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage (rare) Diarrhoea (due to sympathetic block of the bowel, quite common) Abdominal aoic dissection - It occurs due to direct damage by the needle.

    "explanation": "Ketamine increases all the pressures. i.e intracranial pressure, intraocular pressure, blood pressure, intragastric pressure. With the rise in CBF and the generalized increase in sympathetic nervous system response, ICP increases after ketamine use. The increase in CMRO2 and CBF can be blocked by the use of thiopental or diazepam. The received dogma about ketamine is that it increases cerebral oxygen consumption, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial pressure. These effects would seem to preclude its use in patients with space-occupying intracranial lesions such as occur with head trauma; however, recent publications offer convincing evidence that when combined with a benzodiazepine (or another agent acting on the same GABA receptor system) and controlled ventilation (in techniques that exclude nitrous oxide), ketamine is not associated with increased intracranial pressure. Ketamine increases aerial blood pressure, hea rate, and cardiac output, paicularly after rapid bolus injections. These indirect cardiovascular effects are due to the central stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine after release at nerve terminals. Accompanying these changes are increases in pulmonary aery pressure and myocardial work Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e"

    "explanation": "Rocuronium is a monoquaternary steroid analogue of vecuronium was designed to provide a rapid onset of action. Rocuronium is the fastest acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. Rocuronium (at a dose of 0.9-1.2 mg/kg) has an onset of action that approaches succinylcholine (60-90 s), making it a suitable alternative for rapid-sequence induction. Rocuronium is less potent than most other steroidal muscle relaxants (potency appears to be inversely related to speed of onset). Because rocuronium does not have active metabolites, it may be a better choice than vecuronium for prolonged infusions. Its duration of action is not significantly affected by renal disease, but it is modestly prolonged by severe hepatic failure and pregnancy. Ref: Morgan, Jr. G.E., Mikhail M.S., Murray M.J. (2006).

Gender can affect the block height theoretically. The density of CSF is lower in women compared with men. Although this may affect relative baricity of local anesthetics, the clinical variation in the spread is probably unimpoant. Hence this is the best answer to choose from the above options. Other Options : Age: Higher anesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinal anesthetic. Age-related decreases in CSF volume and the higher sensitivity of the nerve roots to local anesthetic are the possible reasons. Pregnancy: Increased intraabdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, decrease CSF volume and thus increase block height. This includes conditions such as pregnancy, ascites, and large abdominal tumors. Height: Within the range of \"normal-sized\" adults, patient height does not seem to affect the spread of spinal anesthesia. But extremes of height can affect the block height."

Treatment begins with discontinuation of the transfusion, followed by aggressive fluid resuscitation to suppo the hypotensive episode and increase urine output. Inducing diuresis through aggressive fluid resuscitation and osmotic diuretics is impoant to clear the hemolyzed red cell membranes, which can otherwise collect in glomeruli and cause renal damage.

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Used prophylactically in baby born with <1 kg wt or < 28 week gestation According to Indian Journal of pediatrics Early cPAP in respiratory distress syndrome It is impoant to note that cPAP helps mainly by preventing the alveolar collapse in infants with surfactant deficiency. Once atelactasis and collapse have occurred cPAP might not help much. Therefore all pretenn infants < 35 weeks with any sign of respiratory distress should be staed immediately on cPAP. Prophylactic cPAY Extending the above logic some have advocated the use of prophylactic cPAP before the onset of respiratory distress in preterm VLBW infants as majority of them would eventually develop respiratory distress. However there is no evidence for any additional benefits with this approach, indeed there are concerns regarding increased adverse effect such as intraventricular hemorrhage. \"Hence prophylactic cPAP is not recommended at present\". Beneficial effects of cPAP Increase in. functional residual capacity Increased pulmonary compliance Prevents alveolar collapse Increases airway diameter Conserves surfactant Decrease in alveolar aerial 02 pressure gradiant. More on cPAP Continuous positive airway pressure is a modality in which increased pulmonary pressure is provided during the expiratory phase of respiration in spontaneously breathing neonates. The mechanism by which CPAP produces its beneficial effects includes:? - Increased alveolar recruitment and stability - Redistribution of lung water This results in improved V/Q matching The administration of CPAP :? - Decreases oxygen requirements - Decreased need for mechanical ventilation and - Reduces moality and duration of respiratory assistance Indications of CPAP Inadequate aerial blood gas values - Inability to maintain a PaO, greater than 50 mmHg with Fi02 .60. cPAP is initiated in newborns with RDS when Pa02 is approximately less than 50 mmHg on a Fi02 of .40. Abnormalities on physical examination - the presence of increased work of breathing as indicated by an increase in respiratory rate of >30% of normal, substernal and suprasternal retractions grunting and nasal flaring, the presence of pale or cyanotic skin colour and agitation.

    "explanation": "Ans. C: Patient in shock Overall, nitrous oxide is a very safe drug with few absolute contraindications. Absolute contraindications - Nitrous oxide is contraindicated in patients with significant respiratory compromise. The blood: gas paition coefficient of nitrous oxide is 34 times greater than that of nitrogen. This differential solubility means that nitrous oxide can leave the bloodstream and enter air-filled cavities 34 times faster than nitrogen. As a result, nitrous is contraindicated in patients in whom expansion of these air-filled cavities could compromise patient safety. This includes patients with pneumothorax, pulmonary blebs, air embolism, bowel obstruction, and those undergoing surgery of the middle ear and tympanoplasties. - Pneumoperitoneum - Pneumoencephalum - Acute intestinal surgeries and volvulus of gut as it may increase gut distension Relative contraindications - Nitrous oxide is known to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate metabolism. In patients with these preexisting conditions, nitrous oxide should only be used with full precautionary consideration and close monitoring. Paicular precautions should be taken in pediatric patients with underlying vitamin B12 deficiency (genetic or environmental) and conditions related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous oxide is relatively contraindicated in pregnancy. It is known to have potential teratogenic and fetal toxic effects, paicularly with chronic use. In vitro it depresses myocardium but in vivo this effect is not seen because of stimulation of sympathetic system, so it can be used safely for cardiac patients and for patients in shock."

First IV canula is inseed usually in the dorsum of hand. Then tourniquet cuff is applied to proximal arm. Limb is elevated and exsanguinated with the help of an elastic bandage (Esmarch). Now tourniquet cuff is inflated above systolic pressure (so that no blood can enter in that limb and the limb remains exsanguinated). Now the local anaesthetic solution is slowly injected into cannula. The veins are filled with only local anaesthetic as there is no blood -ocal anaesthetic can not be drained out from upper limb and can not enter in systemic circulation because of inflated cuff in proximal arm. The arm is anaesthetized in 6-8 minutes. Lidocaine without adrenaline is the DOC for this technique. --Goodman & Gilman llthie 381 o A few clinician prefers prilocaine over lidocaine because of its higher therapeutic index - least toxic LA. Torniquet cuff deflation, premature release or failure of torniquet can cause release of LA into circulation and toxicity may occur- So, cardiotoxic LAs like bupivacaine and etidocaine are contraindicated for Bier's block."

This is the Meyer-Oveon hypothesis put forward in 1899-1901 by Hans Horst Meyer and Charles Ernest Oveon. MAC is inversely related to potency, i.e. high MAC equals low potency. MAC values of adult Halothane: 0.75 Sevoflurane: 2.0 Isoflurane: 1.2 Desflurane: 6.0 Enflurane: 1.7 Xenon: 70 N2O: 104 Factors affecting: MAC increases with hypehermia, hypernatremia, and redheads. MAC decreases with anemia, hypercarbia, hypoxia, hypothermia, hypotension (MAP < 40 mmHg), and pregnancy. Medications, illicit drugs, and prior substance use history have also been found to affect MAC. For example, acute use of amphetamines, cocaine, ephedrine, and chronic use of alcohol increase MAC. Whereas, administration of propofol, etomidate, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ketamine, opiates, local anesthetics, lithium, verapamil, and alpha 2-agonists (dexmedetomidine, clonidine) decrease MAC. Acute alcohol intoxication and chronic amphetamine use have also been found to decrease MAC. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e"

If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N20), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intralveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli Concentration effect. If another inhalation agent is (eg Halothane) is being given at the same time, it also will be delivered to lung from the cylinder (due to negative intraalveolar pressure) Second gas effect. During recovery reverse occurs - N20 having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air --> paial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced. The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia. Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% 02 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N20, instead of straight away switching over to air."

    "explanation": "Orotracheal intubation Patients with severe maxillofacial trauma and with low Sp02 even on oxygen suggests severe airway compromise or obstruction. In these cases emergency airway management is essential. The patient require immediate oxygen. - These patients needs to be intubated immediately. - But an impoant point to note is that severe maxillofacial trauma makes intubation very difficult. -Some believe that nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in patients with severe maxillofacial injury because nasotracheal intubation in these patients can result in nasocranial intubation or severe nasal hemorrhage. - Nasotracheal intubation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with midfacial injury and C.S.F. rhinorrhoea. Orotracheal intubation in patients with severe maxillofacial injury In patients with severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation is also difficult. Presence of blood clots, .fractures make the passage of the tube quite difficult. Moreover when the surgeons perform operation for mandibular or maxillary fractures they wires both these together. If surgery is required with severe maxillofacial injury surgeons usually prefer nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Tracheostomy in patient with severe maxillofacial injury : ? Tracheostomy does not have much role in \"emergency airways management\". - Tracheostomy is a time taking procedure compared to intubation. - If the airways of the patient is severely compromised and he requires immediate oxygenation, tracheostomy has no role. - Immediate oxygenation can only be delivered by rapid intubation. In case, intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. -In emergency management of the airway, cricothyroidotomy is done if intubation is not possible. Tracheostomy is only done when immediate oxygen requirements are taken care of and a surgical procedure is planned. In the question the Sp02 of the patient is 80% when on oxygen. He requires immediate emergency management of the airway which can be achieved through intubation, If intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. The better option of intubation in this patient is orotracheal intubation. The ideal management in this patient is cricothyroidotomy. Since that is not mentioned in the question intubation in the next best option. \"Orotracheal intubation would be preferred over nasotracheal intubation in these cases\""

Mydriatic effect of cocaine depends upon presence of a functioning adrenergic innervation. Procaine causes vasodilation hence it is usually given with adrenaline. The main shocomings of procaine are: Being a vasodilator, when it is given in the absence of a vasoconstrictor agent procaine is rapidly absorbed into the circulation and hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase.

    "explanation": "In supraclavicular approach of brachial block as pleura is in close vicinity. The anterior rami of C5 to T1 form the brachial plexus, which exits the cervical spine to form the superior, middle, and inferior trunks that travel between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. Each trunk divides into an anterior and posterior branch, which subsequently rejoins to form the lateral, posterior, and medial cords as it travels distally to the clavicle. The supraclavicular approach blocks the brachial plexus from the distal trunks to the proximal cords but often is targeted at the divisions level. General complications to peripheral nerve blockade apply to supraclavicular blocks including risk for infection, bleeding, and neuropathy. With the advent of ultrasonography, constant visualization of the needle tip, first rib, and pleura can decrease the risk for pneumothorax. Common, self-limited, side effects associated with other proximal brachial plexus blockade include hoarseness due to an ipsilateral laryngeal nerve block, Horner syndrome from stellate ganglion block, and hemidiaphragmatic paresis from a phrenic nerve blockade."

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "C i.e. Pollarad tube with infiltration block When fire breaks out during laser vocal cord surgery, oxygen should be turned off, ventilation stopped, tracheal tube removed and submerged in water and the patient should be ventilated with facemasK. Airway damage is assessed with bronchoscopy and bronchial lavage, steroids, can be used for treatment. Anesthesia for Endoscopic Surgeries of Airway Endoscopy includes laryngoscopy, microlaryngoscopy (i.e. aided by an operating microscope), bronchoscopy & oesophagoscopy. These procedures may be accompanied by laser surgery. Microlaryngoscopic surgeries include biopsy / surgery of laryngeal malignancy, vocal cord polyps etc. It is associated with some specific problems as - common field for anesthetist & surgeon, already reduced glottic opening d/t growth, laryngospasm (mediated by superior laryngeal nerve) d/t laryngeal stimulation, very high chances of aspiration and myocardial ischemia (- 4% due to sympethetic stimulation). Preoperative Considerations - Sedative premedication is contraindicated in any patient with any significant degree of upper airway obstructionQ, d/t fear of aspiration. Glycopyrrolate, 1 hour before surgery minimize secretions, thereby facilitate ventilation. Pethidine & promethazine are only given if there is no airway obstruction. Laser Precautions General laser precautions include wearing protective spectacles to prevent retinal damage and evacuation of toxic fumes (laser plume) from tissue vaporization which may have potential to transmit microbacterial diseases. Greatest fear during laser airway surgery is a tracheal tube fire. This can be avoided by using a technique of ventilation that does not involve a flammable tube or catheter (eg intermittent apnea or jet ventilation through the laryngoscope side po). The potential fuel source should have laser resistant propeies (laser tubes or wrapping a tracheal tube with metallic tape) or be removed (supraglottic jet ventilation technique). The only non inflammable, laser proof tube is the all metal. Noon tube, which has no cuff. Most laser tubes have laser resistant propeies around the shaft, but the cuff is not protected and can ignite. So there are double cuffs to seal the airway- if upper cuff is struck by laser and saline escapes, the lower cuff will continue to seal the airway. No cuffed tracheal tube, or any currently available tube protection is completely laser proof. Therefore, whenever laser airway surgery is being performed with a tracheal tube in place, the following precaution should be observed. - Inspired 02 conc. should be as low as possible may be upto 21% - N20 suppo combustion & should be replaced with air (N2) or heliumQ - Tracheal tube cuffs should be filled with saline dyed with methylene blue to dessipate heat & signal cuff rupture - A cuffed tube will minimize 02 conc. in the parynx. The addition of 2% lidocaine jelly (1:2 mixture with saline) can seal small laser induced cuff leaks, potentially preventing combustion - Laser intensity & duration should be limited as much as possible. - Saline soaked pledgets (completely saturated) should be placed in the airway to limit risk of ignition. - A source of water (60 ml) should be immediately available in case of fire. Muscle Relaxation Profound muscle relaxation is the aim to provide masseter muscle relaxation for introduction of suspension laryngoscope & an immobile surgical field. - Anesthesia is induced with IV induction agent followed by a non depolarizing muscle relaxant; the vocal cords are sprayed with 3 ml lidocaine 4% to assist smooth anesthesia & to minimize the possibility of postextubation laryngospasmQ - Alternatively the cords may be painted with 3% cocaine at the end of procedure, which has the added advantage of reducing bleeding from operative site. Oxygentation & Ventilation - Microlaryngoscopy tubes are long, have a small internal and external diameter, and are designed specifically for endoscopic procedures (but not suitable for laser surgery). Typically 4 to 5 mm internal diameter tubes with high volume, low pressure cuffs are used in nasal or oral versions. The most popular anesthetic technique use a Coplan's microlaryngoscopy tube (5mm ID, 31cm long, 10m1 cuff volume and constructed from soft plastic). It is designed for micro laryngeal surgery or for patient whose airway has been narrowed to such an extent that a normal sized tracheal tube cannot be inseed. The small tube diameter provides better visibility and access to surgical field but may lit incomplete exhalation and occlusion. - Most commonly the patients are intubated with small diameter (4 - 6 mm) tracheal tubesQ; - Standandard tracheal tubes of this size, however, are designed for pediatric patients. They tend to be too sho for adult trachea (in length)Q with a low volume cuff that will exe high pressure against it - A 4 - 6 mm microlaryngea tracheal (MLT) tubes (Mallinckrodt critical Care) is the same length as the adult tube, has dispropoionately large high volume low pressure cuff, and is stiffer and less prone to compression than a regular tracheal tube. - The advantages of intubation include - protection against aspiration, and the ability to administer inhalational anesthetics and enable monitoring of ventilation by capnography and spirometry, by measuring end tidal CO2Q - In some cases (eg those involving posterior commissure), intubation may interfere with surgeon's visualization and then alternatives are: 1.Insufflation of high flows of oxygen through small catheter placed in the trachea 2. Intermittent apnea technique. Jet ventilation through laryngoscope High frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV)"

Enflurane o It is a faster acting substitute of halothane. o It is halogenated ether. o Because of its propensity to provoke seizures, it has been superseded by isoflurane. Isoflurane o It is an isomer of enflurane with similar properties but 1 1/2 times more potent. o BP falls due to vasodilation, while cardiac output is maintained - inhalation anaesthetic of choice in cardiac surgery (intravenous anaesthetic of choice for cardiac surgery is etomidate). o It does not sensitize the heart to Adr - safe in pheochromocytoma. o It does not provoke seizures preferred in neurosurgery. o Uterine and skeletal muscle relaxant action is similar to halothane - can be used for assisting version as an alternative to halothane. o It causes significant respiratory depression. o Coronary circulation is maintained - safer in patients with MI. o It can cause coronary steal phenomenon. o It can be used for day care surgery (also sevoflurane and desflurane). o It is also used to produce controlled hypotension. Desflurane o It is a newer all flourinated congener of isoflurane which has gained popularity as an anaesthetic for out patient surgery. o It is fastest acting inhalation anaesthetic with blood : gas partition cofficient 0.42. o It is highly volatile - a thermostatically heated special vaporizer is used to deliver a precise concentration of pure desflurane vapour in carrier gas (N2O + O2) mixture. o It is less potent than isoflurane, higher concentration has to be used for induction - may induce coughing, and laryngospasm because of pungent odour - unsuitable for induction. o Degree of respiratory depression, muscle relaxation, vasodilation and fall in BP, as well as maintained cardiac contractility and coronary circulation are like isoflurane. o Both isoflurane and desflurane do not provoke seizures, are not arrhythmogenic and do not have liver and kidney toxicity. Sevoflurane o It is more potent than desflurane but less potent than isoflurane. o Unlike desflurane it poses no problem in induction, acceptibility is good even by pediatric patients - inducing agent of choice in children. o Sevoflurane is degraded by contact with the CO2 absorbent (soda lime) in anesthesia machines, yielding a vinyl ether called 4 Compound A ' which can cause renal damage. -- Katzung 10th/e - 401"

Prilocaine is the only local anesthetic that is metabolized to o -toluidine, which conves hemoglobin to methemoglobin producing methemoglobinemia. This is usually significant with doses of prilocaine as large as 600mg. Benzocaine used in topical local anesthetic sprays can also cause dangerous Methemoglobinemia. Treatment of medically impoant methemoglobinemia includes intravenous methylene blue (1-2 mg/kg of a 1% solution over 5 min).

Propofol is highly protein bound, and its pharmacokinetics may be affected by conditions that alter serum protein levels. The sedative and hypnotic actions of propofol are mediated by its action on GABAA receptors; agonism at these receptors results in an increased chloride conduction and hyperpolarization of neurons. Propofol is metabolized in the liver by conjugation to sulfate and glucuronide to less active metabolites that are renally excreted. Ref: Patel P.M., Patel H.H., Roth D.M. (2011). Chapter 19.

Neuroprotective Decreases EEG activity Anticonvulsant It often produces a subjective feeling of well being on emergence. Metabolism The termination of action of the drug is primarily due to rapid redistribution from centrally highly perfused organs to less perfused organs. Final metabolism - In liver Pharmacodynamics effects:- CNS - Decrease in CMRO2 and CBF, thereby lowering ICP. Improves cerebral perfusion and compliance. Neuroprotective propeies:- Primarily by decreasing oxygen demand. Secondarily by reverse steal on CBF, free - radical scavenging, stabilization of liposomal membranes, as well as excitatory amino- acid receptor blockade. Decrease EEG activity and possess potent anticonvulsant activity. (Methohexital is only barbiturate with epileptogenic effects) CVS - Decreases systemic aerial pressure. Decreases cardiac out put. Decreases peripheral vascular resistance. R.S - Respiratory depression, blunts hypoxiuc hypercepnic drive. Can cause, larygospasm or bronchospasm following induction. Hepatic and Renal - Preexisting hepatic and renal disease result in decreased plasma protein binding of the drug thus enhancing its CNS and cardiovascular depressant propeies.

Xe is derived from a paicle decay of radioactive heavy metals such as uranium and thorium. Xe naturally occurs in the atmosphere in trace amounts (1:11.5 million ) and is extracted from liquefied air by sequential cryogenic fractional distillation. Unlike volatile anesthetics and N2O, which produce diverse hemodynamic actions in the absence or presence of hea disease, Xe is essentially devoid of major cardiovascular effects. Xe did not affect voltage-gated Ca2+ currents and caused minimal inhibition of transient outward K+ currents in human atrial myocytes in vitro.

It is at the level of T12 and L1 vertebrae anterior to the crura of the diaphragm. It contains visceral afferent and efferent fibers divided from T5 to T12. by means of greater, lesser and least splanchnic nerves. Celiac plexus innervates most of the abdominal viscera, therefore this procedure blocks the nerves which come from the pancreas, liver, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, spleen, kidney and adrenal glands.o A celiac plexus block can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdominal surgery.o Because celiac plexus block results in blockade of the autonomic nervous system, this block may help to reduce stress and endocrine responses to surgery. For the same reason, the most common complication of celiac plexns block is postural hypotenstion because of blockade of lumbar sympathetic chain leading to upper abdominal vessel dilation and venous pooling.o Celiac plexus block can be done by following three approaches : - Retrocrural (classic) approach, anterocrural approach and splanchnic nerve block.o Celiac plexus block is given to treat intractable pain in chronic pancreatitis, gastric & pancreatic malignancies. It can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdomiual surgery.o Postural hypotension is the Most common complication of classic retrocrural and splanchnic nerve block.

To reach a near steady state more quickly requires a bolus be administered before the infusion is commenced (or increased). Remifentanil perhaps represents a paial exception to this general rule. Also, opioid concentrations will increase for many hours after an infusion is commenced; in other words, concentrations are typically increasing even though the infusion rate may have been the same for hours! That remifentanil achieves a near steady state relatively quickly is ceainly pa of why it has emerged as a popular drug for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA)."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Mapleson A or the Magill circuit is the circuit of choice for spontaneous ventilation. In all mapleson circuits, rebreathing of carbon dioxide is prevented by an adequate fresh gas flow and by the presence of adjustable pressure release valve. The exhaled carbon dioxide flows through the outer corrugated tube and out this valve from where it can be scavenged. Out of these, Mapleson A circuit is considered the best for spontaneous ventilation because it requires a fresh gas inflow rate of only 1 times minute ventilation to prevent rebreathing of carbon dioxide. In mapleson circuits D, E, and F, the amount of fresh gas flow required is 2.5 times a minute ventilation and in mapleson circuits B and C, it is much higher. But the disadvantage of mapleson circuit A is that it is not very useful in controlled ventilation because a minute ventilation as high as 20 L/minute (fresh gas flow rate should be greater than 3 times a minute ventilation) is needed to prevent rebreathing."

Normal value is 35-45 mm Hg (4% to 6%).o Capnography works on the principle that infrared light is absorbed by carbon dioxide. A beam of infrared light is passed across the gas sample to fall on to a sensor. The presence of CO2 in the gas leads to a reduction in the amount of light falling on the sensor which changes the voltage in the circuit.Uses of CapnographyIt is the surest confirmatory sign of correct intubation in trachea. Incorrect position of tube in esophagus instead of trachea (esophageal intubation) will yield ETC02 = 0.Intraoperative displacement of endotracheal tube - ETCO2 will become zero.Obstruction or disconnections of endotracheal tube - ETCO2 will fall.Diagnosing malignant hyperthermia - ETCO2 increases significantly (more than 100 mg Hg)."

Rebreathing of carbon dioxide is prevented by an adequate fresh gas flow and by the presence of adjustable pressure release valve. The exhaled carbon dioxide flows through the outer corrugated tube and out this valve from where it can be scavenged. The fresh gas flows through the inner tube. When anesthetic gas inflow is much greater than the uptake by the patient and the circuit, excess pressure builds up, which leads to the opening of the adjustable pressure valve and expelling out of the gases."

This interpretation focused attention on anesthetic effects on the bulk physical propeies of cell membranes, which were known at that time to consist primarily of lipid molecules. Such nonspecific or \"lipoid-based\" anesthetic theories dominated the field from the 1960s to the 1980s. Moreover, the simple elegance of the relationship between MAC and lipid solubility graphically illustrated Meyer and Oveon's conclusion that \"All chemically indifferent substances that are soluble in fat are anesthetics ... their relative potency as anesthetics will depend on their affinity to fat on the one hand and water on the other hand, that is, on the fat/water paition coefficient. This was interpreted as oring lipids as the primary targets of anesthetics and a single nonspecific theory to explain anesthesia. Objections to the outdated lipid hypotheses: 1. Stereoisomers of an anesthetic drug Stereoisomers that represent mirror images of each other are termed enantiomers or optical isomers (for example, the isomers of R-(+)- and S-(-)-etomidate). Physicochemical effects of enantiomers are always identical in an achiral environment (for example in the lipid bilayer). However, in vivo enantiomers of many general anesthetics (e.g. isoflurane, thiopental, etomidate) can differ greatly in their anesthetic potency despite the similar oil/gas paition coefficients. For example, the R-(+) isomer of etomidate is 10 times more potent anesthetic than its S-(-) isomer 2. Non-immobilizers According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, the anesthetic potency of the drug is directly propoional to its lipid solubility, however, there are many compounds that do not satisfy this rule. These drugs are strikingly similar to potent general anesthetics and are predicted to be potent anesthetics based on their lipid solubility, but they exe only one constituent of the anesthetic action (amnesia) and do not suppress movement (i.e. do not depress spinal cord functions) as all anesthetics do. These drugs are referred to as non-immobilizers. 3. Temperature increases do not have an anesthetic effect 4. Effect vanishes beyond a ceain chain length According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, in a homologous series of any general anesthetic (e.g. n-alcohols, or alkanes), increasing the chain length increases the lipid solubility, and thereby should produce a corresponding increase in anesthetic potency. However, beyond a ceain chain length, the anesthetic effect disappears. For the n-alcohols, this cutoff occurs at a carbon chain length of about 13 and for the n-alkanes at a chain length of between 6 and 10, depending on the species. 5. Non-hydrophobic anesthetics.

Enantiomers exist in two different spatial configurations, like right- and left-handed gloves, and are present in equal amounts in a racemic solution. They are optically active and can be differentiated by their effects on the rotation of the plane of a polarised light into dextrorotatory or levorotatory stereoisomers. The physicochemical propeies of the two enantiomeric molecules are identical, but the two enantiomers can have substantially different behaviours in their affinity for either the site of action or the sites involved in the generation of side effects. R(+) and S(-) enantiomers of local anaesthetics have been demonstrated to have different affinity for different ion channels of sodium, potassium, and calcium; this results in a significant reduction in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiac toxicity (cardiotoxicity) of the S(-)enantiomer as compared with the R(+)enantiomer. The technological advancements have made it possible to develop Ropivacaine as an optically pure S(-) enantiomeric from the parent chiral molecule propivacaine.

    "explanation": "Etomidate Effects of Etomidate on cardiovascular system Etomidate has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system. It causes mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance which may cause a slight decline in aerial blood pressure. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol : The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in aerial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload). Propofol markedly impairs the normal aerial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload. Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental) The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, basline autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease. Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure. Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in hea rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes. However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia. congestive hea ,failure, 13 adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and aerial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression. Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular system Ketamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased aerial blood pressure, hea rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary aery pressure and myocardial work. Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary aery disease, uncontrolled hypeension, congestive hea failure and aerial aneurysms."

    "explanation": "B i.e. Pethidine Meperidine (pethidine, demerol), a phenylpiperidine is metabolized chiefly in liver to nonmeperidine, which is eliminated by the kidney and liver. In patients or addicts who are tolerant to the depressant effects of meperidine, large doses repeated at sho interval may produce an excitatory syndrome including hallncination, tremors, muscle twitches, dilated pupils, hyperactive reflexes and convulsions. These excitatory symptoms are d/t accumulation of normeperidine, which has a half life of 15-20 hours, compared to 3 hours for meperidine. In patients with cirrhosis, the bioavailability of meperidine is --80% increased and t1/2 of both meperidine and normeperidine are prolonged. Since normeperidine is eleminated by kidney and liver, decreased renal or hepatic function predispose to neurotoxic effects of nor-meperidineQ. Meperidine is also not recommended for the treatment of chronic pain b/o concerns of metabolite toxicity. It should not be used for longer than 48 hours or in doses > 600 mg/day. Major pathway for morphine metabolism is conjugation with glucuronic acid forming morphine -6- glucuronide and morphine -3- glucuronide. Morphine-6-glucuronide is twice as potent as morphine with somewhat longer t1/2. (t1/2 of morphine is 2 hours) and pharmacological actions indistinguishable from those of morphine. With chronic morphine administration, the 6-glucuronide accounts for most of analgesia and its blood levels exceed those of morphine. Morphine-6-glucuronide is excreted by kidney, so its levels increase in renal failure, perhaps explaining morphine's potency and long action in compromised renal function. So in patients with renal failure decreased protein binding of morphine (resulting in higher plasma free drug level) and accumulation of morphine -6- glucuronide predispose them to respiratory depression. So morphine is given cautiously in low doses in renal failure. Respiratory depression is also repoed in patients with CRF receiving sufentanyl. Except for slightly decreased protein binding, the free drug volume of distribution and clearance of alfentanil appears to be unaffected by renal failure. Fentanyl, has sho half life and its metabolites are inactive. Therefore, it is a good choice in patients with renal diseaseQ. In renal disease (renal failure) remifentanil > fentanyl > alfentanil > sufentanil are safe. Whereas morphine (d/t morphine 6 glucoronide) 1/t respiratory depression is used very cautiously in low dose and meperidine (pethidine) is contraindicated d/t very long acting metabolite nor-meperidine causing neurotoxic excitatory syndrome."

    "explanation": "There are at least five different classes of precipitating factors in Acute intermittent porphyria: ALAS-N inducers: most precipitating factors can be related to an associated increase in the activity of ALAS-N in the liver. An overproduction of ALA then makes the paially deficient PBGD activity rate limiting. Endocrine factors: the clinical disease is more common in women, especially at the time of menses. The disease also hardly becomes manifest before pubey. Calorie intake: reduced calorie intake often leads to exacerbations of AIP. Additional calories on a diet may reduce PBG excretion and suppress clinical symptoms. Drugs and foreign chemicals: barbiturates, sex steroids, and other foreign chemicals that exacerbate porphyria have the potential to induce cytochrome P450. The resultant enhanced demand for heme synthesis may lead to induction of hepatic ALAS-N. Stress: stress is known to upregulate the heme oxygenase gene and leads to exacerbations of AIP. Similarly, other forms of stress, including intercurrent illnesses, infections, alcoholic excess, and surgery, are all known to contribute to the genesis of an acute attack of this disorder."

Midazolam may be administered by mouth,parenterally, or the intranasal or endorectal route in children; preservative free intrathecal midazolam has been used for postoperative analgesia in caesarean section delivery. It has been postulated that a possible mechanism for the anti-emetic effect of miazolam could be an action at the chemoreceptor trigger zone reducing synthesis, release and postsynaptic effect of dopamine. Whether midazolam reduce dopamine release centrally, or by blocking the re-uptake of adenosine, causing anadenosine-mediated reduction of dopamine release, has been matter of debate."

    "explanation": "Exentration operation One major problem with N20 is that it will exchange with N2 in any air containing cavity in the body. Moreover, because of their differential blood : gas paition coefficients, nitrous oxide will enter the cavity faster than nitrogen escapes, thereby increasing the volume and/or pressure in the cavity. Examples of air collections that can be expanded by nitrous oxide are : - Pneumothorax - Air embolus - Obstructed middle ear - Obstructed loop of bowel - lntracranial air - A pulmonary (bleep) Nitrous oxide should be avoided in these clinical settings: Now lets move on to the options Nitrous oxide in vitreoretinal surgery The use of nitrous oxide anaesthesia in patients with an intraocular gas bubble is potentially sight threatening. Patients who have vitreoretinal surgery often have a gas bubble deliberately left within the eyes as it helps keep the retina attached while adhesions develop. Filtered room air, Sulfur hexqfluoride and perfluoropropane are the most commonly used gases. By varying the concentration volume and type of gas used, bubbles can be produced that will last upto 70 days before being completely absorbed. If nitrous oxide is administered during this time the bubble will rapidly expand with the risk of retinal and optic nerve ischemia. Nitrous oxide and middle ear surgeries Middle ear cavity is connected to eustachian tube. When nitrous oxide is inhaled in large quantities N20 replaces the N2 in the middle air cavity thereby increasing the pressure in the cavity. After discontinuation of N20 the gas is rapidly reabsorbed from the cavity thus creating negative pressure in the cavity this may cause: ? - Serous otitis media - Disaiculation of stapes - Impaired hearing N20 anaesthesia is hazadrous to hearing iu patients who have previously undergone reconstructive middle ear surgery. Microlaryngeal surgery CO2and (Nd : YAG) lasers are frequently used for microsurgery on the upper airway and trachea. Lasers can ignite materials used in anaesthesia.

Cerebrovascular responsiveness to CO2 is preserved, and reducing the aerial CO2 tension by hyperventilation attenuates the ketamine induced rise in ICT. Ketamine has direct myocardial depressant (negative ionotropic) & vasodilator effect. However, ketamine also has indirect sympathomimetic effect. Indirect sympathomimetic effect predominates over direct myocardial depressant &vasodilator effect; usual response is increased BP, cardiac output and hea rate-Cardiac 02 demand is increased. Ketamine is contraindicated in aoic aneurysm, hypeensive and ischemic hea disease. Ketamine also sensitizes the hea to adrenaline - arrhythmias may occur. As ketamine cause sympathetic stimulation, it is the intravenous anaesthetic of choice in patients with shock and hypovolemia.

On examination he is suspected to have a splenic injury and is supposed to undergo an emergency laparotomy. The ideal anaesthetic agent of choice would be etomidate, as it has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system.\"Abdominal trauma patient especially with splenic injury are at high risk of hypotension, etomidate is agent of choice as it has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system.\"\"Etomidate has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system. A mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance is responsible for a slight decline in arterial blood pressure. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine.\"\"Opioids: In general, opioids do not seriously impair cardiovascular function. Meperidine tends to increase heart rate (it is structurally similar to atropine). Ramifentanyl, and alfentanyl are associated with vagus-mediated bradycardia With the exception of meperidine, the opioids do not depress cardiac contractility. Nonetheless, arterial blood pressure often falls as a result of bradycardia, venodilation, and decreased sympathetic reflexes, sometimes requiring vasopressor (eg., ephedrine) support. Meperidine and morphine evoke histamine release in some individuals that can lead to profound drops in systemic vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure.\"\"Halothane: A dose-dependent reduction of arterial blood pressure is due to direct myocardial depression. 2.0 MAC of halothane results in a 50% decrease in blood pressure and cardiac output.\"EtomidateEtomidate is a carboxylated imidazole compound that is a selective positive allosteric modulator at GABA-A receptorQUnlike thiopental does not appear to affect other pentameric ion channels.It is structurally unrelated to other agents.Mechanism of Action:Selective positive allosteric modulator at GABA-A receptorQPharmacokinetics:It is rapidly acting general anesthetic agent with a short duration of action (2-3 min), resulting predominantly from redistribution, although it is also eliminated rapidly from bodyQ.Characteristic Features:It is characterized by hemodynamic stability, minimal respiratory depression and cerebroprotective effectQ.It is a sedative hypnotic but lacks analgesic propertiesQAs with thiopental, cerebral blood flow and metabolism, intracranial and intraocular pressure all fall with etomidateQAs with methohexital, excitatory phenomenon (on induction) may be seen which can be prevented by benzodiazepine premedication or concomitant use of opioid.Central sympathetic out flow is stimulated, which maintains hemodynamics. Because of minimal cardiovascular effect, CPP is well maintained.It enhances somatosensory evoked potentials on EEG.Side-Effects:It causes adrenocortical suppressionQ by inhibiting enzymes 11-beta hydroxylase (mainly) and 17-alpha hydroxylase involved in cortisol and aldosterone (mineralocorticoid) productionQ. Vitamin C supplementation restores cortisol level.Excitatory phenomenon causing myoclonus, hiccups and other involuntary movements (40%); emergence phenomenon causing restlessness and delirium during recoveryQHigh incidence of nausea and vomiting (highest among all IV anesthetics i.e. ~40%)Pain on injection; Vitamin C deficiency; ThrombophlebitisQ"

    "explanation": "Aschners reflex is also called occulocardiac reflex. Aschners reflex is called oculocardiac reflex. The Oculocardiac reflex, also known as Aschner phenomenon, Aschner reflex, or Aschner-Dagnini reflex, is a decrease in pulse rate associated with traction applied to extraocular muscles and/or compression of the eyeball. The reflex is mediated by nerve connections between the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal cranial nerve the ciliary ganglion, and the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. Nerve fibres from the maxillary and mandibular divisionsof the trigeminal nerve have also been documented. These afferents synapse with the visceral motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, located in the reticular formation of the brain stem. The efferent poion is carried by the vagus nerve from the cardiovascular centerof the medulla to the hea, of which increased stimulation leads to decreased output of the sinoatrial node. This reflex is especially seen children, paicularly during strabismus correction surgery.However, this reflex may also occur with adults. Bradycardia,junctional rhythm and asystole, all of which may be life-threatening, can be induced through this reflex. This reflex has been seen to occur during many pan facial trauma surgeries due to stimulation of any of the three branches of trigeminal nerve."

In these infants, for whom an inhalation anesthetic may have increased risks, spinal anesthesia and caudal epidural anesthesia have been used successfully to avoid general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation.The history is compatible with cerebral palsy or congenital myopathies. Since this is an elective surgical repair, complete neurological workup and diagnosis is necessary before anesthetic risk can be assessed.These children are ideal for assessment by a multidisciplinary team which include anaesthesiologists and pediatrician. A complete history and physical examination is essential before anaesthetizing these children, including a discussion of postoperative pain management with the parents. Cognitive and communication problems may make preoperative assessment more difficult. Parents and caretakers are best to be involved during this period not only to gain information but also allay the fears of the child.Anesthetic Concern in Cerebral PalsyIntraoperative hypothermia and slow emergence.Suxamethonium does not cause hyperkalaemia in these patients, and a rapid sequence induction may be indicated.Anesthetic Concern in Neuromuscular DiseasesThe incidence of anaesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis is significant.Succinylcholine and volatile agents should be avoided in at-risk children."

Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants acts by blocking the postsynaptic receptors in a competitive manner so that acetylcholine cannot occupy the receptors to activate depolarization. Neostigmine acts by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase in the cleft of neuromuscular junctions which inturn leads to building up of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft thereby reversing the effects of non depolarizing muscle relaxants that are competitive agonists.

Bier proposed that ongoing leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) causes the headache, ie, leakage of CSF through the dural puncture site exceeds the rate of CSF production and results in low CSF pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging has confirmed that this leads to intracranial hypotension with descent of the brain, thereby causing traction of the sixth cranial nerve and pain-sensitive structures. The stretching of the nerve is thought to cause local ischemia as well as nerve dysfunction and can be seen in association with other signs of intracranial hypotension such as veigo, nausea, and vomiting."

Hypocalcemia is also associated with a prolonged QT interval and may be aggravated by both hypomagnesemia and alkalosis. Additionally, massive transfusion is associated with hypocalcemia secondary to chelation with citrate in banked blood. Severe, symptomatic hypocalcemia, encountered most frequently following parathyroid or thyroid surgery or in patients with acute pancreatitis, should be treated with intravenous calcium gluconate. The myocardium is very sensitive to calcium levels; therefore, calcium is considered a positive inotropic agent. Calcium increases the contractile strength of cardiac muscle as well as the velocity of shoening. In its absence, the efficiency of the myocardium decreases. Hypocalcemia often occurs with hypoproteinemia, even though the ionized serum calcium fraction remains normal."

    "explanation": "Any patient who has lost much of the ileum (whether from injury, disease, or elective surgery) is at high risk of developing enteric hyperoxaluria if the colon remains intact. Calcium oxalate stones can subsequently develop due to excessive absorption of oxalate from the colon. Normally, fatty acids are absorbed by the terminal ileum, and calcium and oxalate combine to form an insoluble compound that is not absorbed. In the absence of the terminal ileum, unabsorbed fatty acids reach the colon, where they combine with calcium, leaving free oxalate to be absorbed. Unabsorbed fatty acids and bile acids in the colon also promote oxalate uptake by the colon. Subsequently, the excess oxalate is excreted by the kidneys, promoting calcium oxalate stone formation. Hungry bone syndrome refers to rapid remineralization of bones leading to hypocalcemia and can be seen postoperatively in patients with secondary or teiary hyperparathyroidism. Pseudohyperparathyroidism refers to hypercalcemia associated with the production of parathyroidrelated peptide. A unicameral bone cyst is a benign lesion found in children"

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Reducing end plate potential Curare (D-tubocurarine) is a competitive neuromuscular blocker. All neuromuscular blockers bind to Nm receptors on end-plate and prevents generation of end-plate potential. Mechanism of action of muscle relaxants To know the mechanism of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants one should know the normal sequences of events in contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle ? A. Contraction There is discharge of motor neuron. Release of Ach at neuromuscular junction. Binding of Ach to nicotinic (NM) cholinergic receptors at end plate. Binding of Ach to nicotinic receptors causes opening of Na.* channels (NM receptor has intrinsic ion channel). Opening of Na+channel generate end plate potential on skeletal muscle membrane. If end plate potential is above a threshold level, action potential is generated on skeletal muscle membrane- depolarization. Depolarization of skeletal muscle membrane causes intracellular release of Ca\" from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca\" binds to troponin 'c', uncovering myosin binding site of actin. Cross linking between actin and myosin, and sliding of thin filaments on thick filaments - contraction. B. Relaxation Ca\" pumped back into sarcoplasmic reticulum. Release of Ca\" from Troponin. Cessation of interaction between actin and myosin - relaxation. Now coming back to the mechanism of different skeletal muscle relaxants. Competitive (nondepolarising) blockers The competitive blockers have affinity for N. receptors but no intrinsic activity. They compete with Ach for N receptor --) called competitive blockers. They prevent binding of Ach to N. receptors- No opening of Na- channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential muscle fails to contract. Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers. Depolarizing blockers Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on A r receptors. They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity)-o, they are called depolarizing blocker. These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistant paial depolarization- Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis. Neostigmine does not antagonise depolarising blockers. Under ceain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases : a. Phase I block Rapid in onset Result from persistant depolarization of muscle end plate. Has classical features of depolarization block. Block is not antogonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine). b. Phase H block Slow in onset Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh. Resembles block produced by competitive blockers. Block is paially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine). In man normally only phase I block is seen typical depolarizing block. Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anaesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose. SCh also produces phase II block in patients with atypical or deficient pseudocholinesterase."

Impedance plethysmography, which measures changes in volume in the lower extremity as related to blood flow, is also used infrequently due to the superiority of duplex scanning in detecting DVTs. In pregnant women, anticoagulation for treatment of DVT is achieved with heparin, which does not cross the placenta, rather than warfarin, which is associated with the risk of spontaneous aboion and bih defects. The vena caval filter is not indicated because there is no contraindication to heparin therapy and no evidence of failure of anticoagulation therapy (pulmonary embolus in the face of adequate anticoagulation)."

However, its onset of action is significantly slower than that of succinylcholine. In addition, the use of a larger dose to speed the onset can be associated with profound histamine release leading to hypotension, flushing, and bronchospasm. Clearance of mivacurium by plasma cholinesterase is rapid and independent of the liver or kidney. However, because patients with renal failure often have decreased levels of plasma cholinesterase, the short duration of action of mivacurium may be prolonged in patients with impaired renal function. Although mivacurium is no longer in widespread clinical use, an investigational ultra-short-acting isoquinoline nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, gantacurium, is currently in phase III clinical testing. This novel compound has a very rapid onset and short duration of action"

Ptosis occurs when the muscles that raise the eyelid (levator palpebrae superiors and muller's nuscles) are not strong enough to do so properly. Etiology of Ptosis may be :? A) Congenital myogenic ptosis :- It is the most common type of ptosis and is often bilateral. It is associated with maldevelopment or congenital weakness of levator palpebrae sperioris. Congenital myogenic ptosis is characterized by drooping of one or both lids at bih, with a diminished or absent lid crease and lid lag on downgaze due to tethering effect of abnormal muscle. It may occur in following forms Simple congenital ptosis :- Not associated with other anomaly Congenital ptosis with superior rectus weakness Blepharophimosis syndrome Congenital ptosis, blepharophimosis, telecanthus and epicanthus inversus. Congenital synkinetic ptosis (Marcus Gunn jaw- winking Ptosis):- Retraction of ptotic lid with jaw movement like chewing, i.e., with stimulation of ipsilateral pterygoid muscle. B) Acquird ptosis :- Depending upon the cause acquired ptosis may be Neurogenic :- It is due to paralysis of 3rd nerve, Horner's syndrome, ophthalmoplegic migraine, multiple sclerosis. Neurogenic ptosis may also occur due to lesion of sympathetic nerve) supplying muller's muscle. Myogenic :- It is due to acquired defect of LPS muscle and may be seen in myasthenia gravis, dystrophia myotonica, ocular myopathy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, thyrotoxicosis, Lambe - Eaton mysthenia syndrome Mechanical:- It is due to excessive weight on the upper lid e.g in lid tumors, multiple chalazia, lid edema. It may also occur due to scarring (cicatracial ptosis) in atients with ocular pemphigoid and trachoma. Aponeurotic ptosis :- It is due to defect of the levator aponeurosis in the presence of normal functioning muscle, e.g. involutional (senile) ptosis, post-operative ptosis."

    "explanation": "ANSWER: (A) Oculocardiac reflexREF: Miller's Anaesthesiology 7th Ed Ch 75OCULOCARDIAC REFLEXThe oculocardiac reflex was first described by Aschner and Dagnini in 1908.Traction on the extraocular muscles or pressure on the globe causes bradycardia, atrioventricular block, ventricular ectopy, or asystole. It is especially seen with traction on the medial rectus muscle, but can occur with stimulation of any of the orbital contents, including the periosteum.The reflex is trigeminovagal. The afferent limb is from orbital contents to ciliary ganglion to ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve to the sensory nucleus of the trigeminal near the fourth ventricle. The efferent limb is via the vagus nerve to the heart.The reflex maybe seen more often with procedures under topical anesthesia. Retrobulbar block is not uniformly effective, however, at preventing the reflex. Orbital injections can trigger the response. The response is exacerbated by hypercapnia or hypoxemia.In the event of arrhythmia, the anesthesiologist first should ask the surgeon to stop manipulations. The ventilatory status is assessed. If significant bradycardia persists or recurs, intravenous atropine is administered in 7 ug/kg increments. Rarely, severe bradycardia or asystole occurs. Although chest compressions might be required to allow the atropine to circulate, usually the heart rhythm returns to normal isnth cessation of manipulation alone. The response fatigues with repeated stimulation.Pretreatment with intravenous atropineorglycopyrrolatecanbeeffective. Pretreatment may be indicated in patients with a history of conduction block, vasovagal responses, or b-blocker therapy"

MAC is 105% (least potent) - even pure N20 at 1 atmospheric pressure can not produce adequate anaesthesia. o It has good analgesic but poor muscle relaxant activity. It is supplied under pressure in blue coloured steel cyclinders. It has very low blood solubility --> induction is quick and smooth with rapid recovery. Second gas effect and diffusion hypoxia occur with N20 only. N20 is generally used as a carrier and adjuvant to other anaesthetics --> A mixture of 70% N20 + 25 - 30% 02+ 0.2 - 2% another potent anaesthetic is employed for most of the surgical procedures. Entonox is a mixture of 50% N20 and 50% 02. It has little effect on respiration, hea and BP. It can cause bone marrow depression and vit B12 deficiency. N20 is the only anaesthetic repoed to produce hematologic toxicity and neurotoxicity with long term administration. Both toxicities are the result of the interaction of N20 with vit B12. Complete bone marrow failure can be expected after several days of continuous exposure. Bone marrow changes are preventable by pretreating patients with large doses of folinic acid. Other manifestations of vit B 12 deficiency eg. megaloblastic anemia, subacute combined degeneration of cord may also occur. Methemoglobinemia and laryngospasm may occur. It is contraindicated in patients with air cavities like pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum and volvulus --> expansion and increase in pressure occur."

The new England journal of medicine Feb 08 vol 358: 700 - 708 nuber 07) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with ventilation (intubation) & 02 treatment. Infants who were born at 25 -28 weeks gestation and were breathing spontaneously were treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) sholy (at 5 minutes) after bih. 50% were subsequently intubated. Infants in CPAP group had a better outcome at 28th day than did those in intubated group (i.e. required significantly lower rate of 02 treatment and underwent fewer days of ventilation) even though the rate of pneumothorae was higher in CPAP group. A CPAP of 8 - 12 cm of water was used to maintain functional residual capacity and for improving lung compliance and oxygenation. The study suggests that staing respiratory suppo with CPAP does not adversely affect, infants even if upto 50% of them subsequently undergo ventilation (intubation), some because of pneumothorax. Ammar et al also showed that 76% of infants < 1.251 kg and 50% of those weighing < 0.751 kg did not need to undergo ventilation (intubation). Previous research suggest that CPAP (nasal) application in preterm infants is associated with benefits in terms of reduced respiratory failure and reduced duration and invasiveness of respiratory suppo; without worsening of other standard measures of neonatal outcome (bronchopulmonary dysplasia & death). Among spontaneously breathing very premature infants, surfactant therapy administered within 10 hour of life along with nasal CPAP decreases the oxygen requirement, need for mechanical ventilation and may prevent chronic lung disease."

    "explanation": "Ketamine is a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant. When it is given to patients with reactive airway disease and bronchospasm, pulmonary compliance is improved. Ketamine is as effective as halothane or enflurane in preventing experimentally induced bronchospasm. The mechanism for this effect is probably a result of the sympathomimetic response to ketamine, but isolated bronchial smooth muscle studies showed that ketamine can directly antagonize the spasmogenic effects of carbachol and histamine. Because of its broncho-dilating effect, the administration of ketamine can treat status asthmaticus unresponsive to conventional therapy. A potential respiratory problem, especially in children, is the increased salivation that follows ketamine administration; this effect can be modulated by an anticholinergic drug such as atropine or glycopyrrolate. Racemic ketamine is a potent bronchodilator, making it a good induction agent for asthmatic patients; however, S(+) ketamine produces minimal bronchodilation.

Mitral stenosis is a disorder where cardiac output remains relatively fixed. Decrease in cardiac output should he avoided at any cost. - Any drug that increases the hea rate will reduce the cardiac output in patient with M.S. All the inhalational agents mentioned in the question decrease systemic vascular resistance and also increase the hea rate. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance leads to fall in blood pressure. Moreover, they may also decrease B.P. by their cardiodepressant action on myocardium. Therefore these drugs should not be used in patients with M.S. \"Xenon has no effects on cardiac output or cardiac rhythum and is not thought to have significant effect on systemic vascular resistance It also does not affect pulmonary function and is not known to have any renal or hepatic toxicity\". The main drawback of Xenon is its high cost and insufficient availability. -Xenon is an ine gas which is quite difficult to obtain and hence extremely expensive. - Xenon has received considerable interest in the last few years because it has many characteristics approaching those of an \"ideal\" inhaled anaesthetics. Mitral stenosis Due to mitral stenosis less blood .flows through the mitral valve to left ventricle. Left ventricle functions normally but is small and poorly.filled. Initially the left ventricle dilates keeping the pulmonary aery pressure low. As disease progresses pulmonary aery pressure increases and medial hyperophy develops resulting in chronic reactive pulmonary hypeension. The right hea hyperophies to pump against a pressure overload, then.fails. The pressure gradient across the narrow mitral orifice increase with the square of cardial output. Rapid hea rates, especially with atrial fibrillation decreases diastolic .filling time and markedly decreases cardiac output. Li / .filling is optimized by slow hea rate. Hemodynamic goals Low normal hea rate 50-70/min, treat tachycardia aggressively with /8 blockers. Maintain sinus rhythmus if possible. Maintain adequate preload Maintain high normal systemic vascular resistance Avoid hypercarbia, acidosis and hypoxia which may exacerbate pulmonary hypeension. The cardiac output is relatively fixed, maintain adequate afterload, slow the hea rate and avoid hypovolemia. Measure CVP and PAOP and maintain high preload. Avoid rapid decrease in afterload."

    "explanation": "Ans: C (Bretylium) TREATMENT OF BUP1VACA1NE INDUCED CARDIOTOXIC1TY MILLER 6TH/933\"Many resuscitation drugs, including atropine, epinephrine, bretylium, lidocaine, amrinone, and phenytoin, have been used in animal studies and occasionally in humans for the treatment of bupivacaine overdose and cardiovascular collapse. In our view, beyond the established uses of epinephrine, vasopressin, and atropine in their designated steps in the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol and beyond the use of Intralipid as detailed later, there is no established role for anti arrhythmic drugs or other traditional resuscitation drugs in the setting of bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest It is not recommended that bupivacaine-induced ventricular arrhythmias be treated with iidocaine or amiodaroneThe clinical implications for cardiac resuscitation after intravascular injection or overdose of local anesthetic are the following: Miller 6th/933No medications are uniformly effective in facilitating resuscitation from bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest or severe ventricular tachycardia. Basic principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be emphasized first, including attention to securing the airway; providing oxygenation and ventilation, and performing chest compressions if needed.Because resuscitation after local anesthetic-induced circulatory collapse is so difficult, prevention of massive intravascular injection or excessive dosing is crucial.Negative aspiration of the syringe does not always exclude intravascular placement, incremental, fractionated dosing should be the rule for all patients undergoing major conduction blockade. Although changes on the ECG are not always present before circulatory collapse, they often are, and continuous attention to the ECG (including changes in QRS morphology, rate, rhythm, or ectopy) may be lifesaving by terminating injection before a lethal dose is administered.If a patient experiences profound cardiovascular depression or circulatory arrest after the administration of bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or by extrapolation, other local anesthetics, then along with initiation of basic life support and theACLS protocol we support the recommendation of Weinberg and colleagues that a rapid bolus of Intralipid 20%<t\\ 1.5 mL/kg (or roughly 100 mL in adults), be administered without delay, followed if necessary by an infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min for the next 10 minutesTreatment of Bupivacaine Induced Cardiotoxicity Barash Anesthesia 6th/545\"Potent local anesthetics (e.g., bupivacaine! can produce profound cardiovascular depression and malignant dysrhythmias that should be promptly treated. Oxygenation and ventilation must be immediately instituted, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation if needed. Ventricular dysrhythmias may be difficult to treat and may need large and multiple doses of electrical cardioversion, epinephrine, vasopressin, and amiodarone. The use of calcium channel blockers in this setting is not recommended, as its cardiodepressant effect is exaggerated\"A novel and promising treatment for cardiac toxicity is the administration of intravenous lipid to theoretically remove bupivacaine from sites of action. Administration of 100 mL of 20% lipid solution has been reported to allow successful resuscitation of a patient from bupivacaine-induced dysrhythmias refractory to conventional therapy.These findings raise the question of whether standard propofol in a 10% lipid solution would be a preferred treatment for cardiac toxicity. However, the dose of lipid in a standard induction dose of propofol would be too small and the dose of propofol would lead to unacceptable cardiac depression"

ABCD of BLS are: -i) Airway management: - Most common cause of airway obstruction is tongue fall, i.e., tongue falling back on posterior pharyngeal wall and obstructing the airway. In BLS, this airway obstruction is managed manually: -a) Open mouth and clear airway if something is visible in oral cavity.b) Tilt the head backward (neck extension) and chin lift -> Head tilt and chin lift.c) Jaw thrust: - Mandible is pulled forward.# Note: In patient with cervical spine injury head tilt & chin lift is contraindicated and airway should be managed only by jaw thrust.ii) Breathing (ventilation): - After management of airway obstruction ventilation is provided. In BLS ventilation is provided by mouth to mouth or mouth to nose or bag and mask ventilation.iii) Circulation: - Circulation is maintained by cardiac massage. It is done in supine position and compression over lower l/3rd of sternum is given by heel of two hands one locked over the other. The force generated during massage should be able to depress the sternum by 1 1/2 -2 inches (approximately 1/3 of chest wall diameter). The ratio of compression to ventilation is 30:2(30 compressions followed by 2 breaths) irrespective of durationiv) Defibrillation: - Defibrillation is done by manual defibrillatorB) Advanced life support (secondary ABCD)# Advanced airway support involves more advanced assessment and treatment. ABCD of advanced life support are: -i) Airway management: - Airway management is done by equipments like GuedeVs airway.ii) Breathing (ventilation): - Most definitive and best method of ventilation is endotracheal intubation. Other methods are LMA or tracheostomy. In severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation should be tried first, if orotracheal intubation is very difficult cricothyrotomy or tracheostomy can be used but only as a last resort.iii) Circulation: - Circulation is maintained by cardiac massage. Compression will be continued at a rate of 100 compressions!minute and breathing at a rate of 8-10 breaths/minute with no synchronization, i.e., no pause for ventilation.iv) Defibrillation : - Defibrillation is done by manual defibrillator."

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., Neuro-muscular junction* Vecuronium, a non-depolarizing blocker, acts on nicotinic receptors at myoneural junction.* Neuro-muscular blocker act at myoneural junction1. Competitive (Non-depolarizing) blocker: -# They compete with Achfor Nm receptors - called competitive blockers. They prevent binding of Ach to Nm receptors - No opening of Na+ channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential - muscle fails to contract. Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers as it increases the concentration of Ach by inhibiting its degradation by cholinesterase. Therefore, Neostigmine is used for the reversal of competitive (nondepolarizing) blockers.2. Depolarizing blockers (Succinylcholine, Decamethonium)# Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on NM receptors. They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity) - So, they are called depolarizing blocker. These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistant partial depolarization - Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis. Neostigmine does not antagonize depolarising blockers (Therefore neostigmine cannot be used for reversal).Inf act neostigmine can potentiate the block as neostigmine and other anti-cholinesterase also inhibits pseudocholinesterase which metabolizes Sch.Under certain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases :a) Phase I block* Rapid in onset* Result from persistant depolarization of muscle end plate - Typical mechanism of action of depolarizing blocker.* Has classical features of depolarization block.* Block is not antagonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine).b) Phase II block (Dual block)* Slow in onset* Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh - Ach can not act on Nm receptors (similar to competitive blocker).* Resembles block produced by competitive blockers - Therefore, has characteristics similar to non-depolarizing (competitive) block.* Block is partially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine).# In man, normally, only phase I block is seen - typical depolarizing block.# Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anaesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose.# SCh also produces phase II block in patients with atypical or deficient pseudocholinesterase."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "The appropriate dosing and timing of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections in an elective procedure is a single dose, no greater than 1 hour prior to the incision. Additionally, most textbooks recommend use of an oral, nonabsorbable antibiotic regimen effective against aerobes and anaerobes in combination with a mechanical bowel preparation before elective colon resections. There is no evidence to suppo the continuation of antibiotics for more than 24 hours after an elective operation has been completed, and this practice should be avoided to prevent increasing microbial drug resistance. For complex, prolonged procedures, redosing of antibiotics may be appropriate during the procedure based on the drug's halflife. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, including against anaerobic organisms, is required only in cases where such flora are anticipated, such as during colon resections."

Sallieck's maneuver is done to prevent aspiration. Manual ventilation before intubation is avoided as this inflates the stomach and encourages regurgitation & aspiration. Rapid sequence anaesthesia When anaesthesia is given for emergency surgery, it is called a \"rapid sequence anaesthesia\". The patients have full stomach because there is no starvation for anaesthesia (it is an emergency surgery) and gastric emptying is delayed due to trauma, acute abdomen. Therefore, the objective of rapid sequence anaesthesia is to secure the airway rapidly and prevent aspiration of gastric contents. Procedure of rapid sequence has following steps : - Li The patient is preoxygenatedfor full 3 minutes. Intravenous induction agent (thiopentone or propofol) is given. Sellick's maneuver (cricoid/pressure) is done to prevent aspiration. After ensuring the correct position of tube cricoid pressure is released and maintenance anaesthesia (NCO 66%, 02% 33%, & inhalational agent) is given. A non-depolarizing blocker is now added.

    "explanation": "Benzodiazepines display minimal left-ventricular depressant effects, even at general anesthetic doses, except when they are coadministered with opioids (these agents interact to produce myocardial depression and aerial hypotension). Benzodiazepines given alone decrease aerial blood pressure, cardiac output, and peripheral vascular resistance slightly, and sometimes increase hea rate. Benzodiazepines reduce cerebral oxygen consumption, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial pressure but not to the extent the barbiturates do. They are effective in controlling grand mal seizures. Sedative doses often produce anterograde amnesia. The mild muscle-relaxing propey of these drugs is mediated at the spinal cord level. The antianxiety, amnestic, and sedative effects seen at lower doses progress to stupor and unconsciousness at anesthetic doses. Compared with propofol or etomidate, induction with benzodiazepines is associated with a slower rate of loss of consciousness and a longer recovery. Benzodiazepines have no direct analgesic propeies. Intramuscular injections of diazepam are painful and unreliably absorbed. In contrast, midazolam and lorazepam are well absorbed after intramuscular injection, with peak levels achieved in 30 and 90 min, respectively. Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e"

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "The most common such vaporizer is the Ohmeda Tec 6, designed specifically for use with desflurane. Desflurane has two physical propeies, making it unsuitable for use with a conventional vaporizer. First, it has a very high SVP (88.5 kPa at 20degC). A conventional vaporizer would require high fresh gas flows to dilute it to within clinically useful concentrations, making it uneconomical. Secondly, it has a low boiling point (23.5degC). At room temperature, it will intermittently boil resulting in large fluctuations in agent delivery. When boiling, there will be excessive agent delivery; however, it will then cool due to a large loss of latent heat of vaporization, resulting in an exponential decrease in SVP and under-delivery of agent. The Ohmeda Tec 6 overcomes these problems by using an electrical filament that heats the desflurane to 39degC, raising its SVP to 194 kPa, that is, nearly 2 atm. In addition to providing a stable SVP, this high pressure removes the need for a pressurized carrier gas--instead, the fresh or diluent gas is entirely separate from the vaporizing chamber"

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient has heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is a complication of heparin therapy, at both prophylactic and therapeutic doses. HIT is mediated by antibodies to the complexes formed by binding of heparin to platelet factor 4. In a previously unexposed patient, HIT typically manifests after 5 days as a decrease in platelet counts by 50% of the highest preceding value or to a level less than 100,000/mm3 . Complications of HIT are related to venous and/or aerial thromboembolic phenomena. Treatment of HIT consists of cessation of heparin (including low-molecular-weight heparins), institution of a nonheparin anticoagulant such as a direct thrombin inhibitor (examples include lepirudin and argatroban), and conversion to oral warfarin when appropriate. Cessation of heparin alone is inadequate to prevent thromboembolic complications, and warfarin should not be staed until the platelet count is above 100,000/mm3 . Platelet transfusion is not indicated, as HIT results in thrombotic rather than hemorrhagic complications."

    ],
    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "Opioids can increase muscle tone and may cause muscle rigidity. The incidence of rigidity noted with opioid anesthetic techniques varies significantly because of differences in dose and speed of opioid administration, the concomitant use of N2O, the presence or absence of muscle relaxants, and the patient's age. Opioid-induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone that sometimes progresses to severe stiffness with the potential for serious problems. Clinically significant opioid-induced rigidity usually begins just as or after a patient loses consciousness. Mild manifestations of rigidity, such as hoarseness, can occur in conscious patients. Vocal cord closure is primarily responsible for the difficult ventilation with a bag and mask that follows the administration of opioids. The precise mechanism by which opioids cause muscle rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not the result of a direct action on muscle fibers because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. Mechanisms of opioid-induced muscle rigidity involving the CNS have been postulated. Pharmacologic investigation using selective agonists and antagonists suggest that systemic opioid-induced muscle rigidity is primarily caused by activation of central m receptors, whereas supraspinal d1 and k1 receptors may attenuate this effect. Some aspects of opioid-induced catatonia and rigidity (increased incidence with age, muscle movements resembling extrapyramidal side effects) are similar to Parkinson's disease and suggest similarities in neurochemical mechanisms. Patients with Parkinson's disease, paicularly if they are inadequately treated, may experience reactions such as dystonia following opioid administration. Pretreatment with or concomitant use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can decrease the incidence and severity of rigidity. Induction doses of sodium thiopental and subanesthetic doses of diazepam and midazolam can prevent, attenuate, or successfully treat rigidity. Rapid administration of larger doses of opioids (paicularly fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, and alfentanil) can induce chest wall rigidity severe enough to make ventilation with bag and mask nearly impossible.

Phase 1 block (depolarizing)Succinylcholine is the only clinically useful depolarizing blocking drug.Its neuromuscular effects are like those of acetylcholine except that succinylcholine produces a longer effect at the myoneural junction.Succinylcholine reacts with the nicotinic receptor to open the channel and cause depolarization of the motor end plate, and this in turn spreads to the adjacent membranes, causing contractions of muscle motor units.Because succinylcholine is not metabolized effectively at the synapse, the depolarized membranes remain depolarized and unresponsive to subsequent impulses (ie, in a state of depolarizing block).Furthermore, because excitation-contraction coupling requires end plate repolarization (\"reprintmg\") and repetitive firing to maintain muscle tension, a flaccid paralysis results.This so-called phase 1 (depolarizing) block is thus augmented, not reversed, by cholinesterase inhibitors.2. Phase II block (desensitizing)With continued exposure to succinylcholine, the initial end plate depolarization decreases and the membrane becomes repolarized.Despite this re polarization, the membrane cannot easily be depolarized again because it is desensitized.The mechanism for this desensitizing phase is unclear, but some evidence indicates that channel block may become more important than agonist action at the receptor in phase II of succinylcholine' s neuromuscular blocking action.Later in phase II. the characteristics of the blockade are nearly identical to those of a nondepolarizing block (ie, a nonsustained twitch response to a tetanic stimulus), with reversal by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors."

It is also referred as Brain mask as it was invented by Dr. Archies Brain. LMA provides an airway intermediate between the face mask and tracheal tube in terms of anatomic position (face mask is on the face, LMA is in the larynx around inlet and tracheal tube is in the trachea), invasiveness, security to protect airway, and facilitate gas exchange. The principle of LMA is that it provides an effective gas tight seal around the laryngeal inlet without anything having to pass through vocal cord.o LMA is very effective in maintaining a patent airway in spontaneously breathing patient. Positive pressure ventilation may be applied if necessory without tracheal intubation.o LMA is available in 8 different sizes (Lee 13th/e 206).Mask sizePatient weight & ageMaximum inflation volume1< 5 Kg, neonates & infants4 ml1[?]55 - 10 kg, Infants7 ml210 -20 kg, Infants & children10ml2.520 - 30 kg, Children14330 - 50, Children & Small adults14450 - 70 kg, Adults30570-100 kg Adult406> 100 kg, Adult o After induction of anaesthesia with propofal (which depresses laryngeal reflexes) LMA is introduced blindly (without laryngoscopy) into the hypopharynx. One of the major disadvantage of LMA is that its seal around laryngeal inlet does not always prevent aspiration. Therefore, LMA should not be used where there is an increased risk of aspiration of stomach contents, e.g., full stomach patient.Indications of LMA1. As an alternative to intubation where difficult intubation is anticipated (difficult airway).2. To facilitate endo-tracheal intubation in a patient with difficult airways.3. Situations involving a difficult mask fit.4. Securing airway (as cardiopulmonary resuscitation) in emergency where intubation and mask ventilation is not possible.5. For minor surgeries (short surgeries), where anaesthetist wants to avoid intubation.6. As a conduit for bronchoscopes, small size tubes, gum elastic bougies.7. For extra and intra-ocular surgeries including retinopathy surgery in premature infants - LMA is particularly useful in ophthalmic surgery as problems created by other two airways are eliminated:-i) Face mask creates problem in surgical field access due to its size (LMA provides a better access).ii) Endotracheal intubation may cause raised IOT (LMA has no effect)."

Function:Laryngoscope blades are used as the primary tool for examination of the interior of the larynx and for placement of an endotracheal tube.Main Feature:The Miller Laryngoscope Blade . . . The most popular of the straight types. The side of the flange is reduced to minimize trauma and the curve at the beak or tip is extended to improve lifting of the epiglottis. These improvements facilitate greater exposure of the larynx in difficult-to-intubate patients. The Macintosh Laryngoscope Blade . . . The Macintosh is the predominate model of the curved blade types. During laryngoscopy, the tip or beak of the blade is compressed into the angle formed by the base of the tongue and the epiglottis, indirectly raising the epiglottis.

Such nonspecific or \"lipoid-based\" anesthetic theories dominated the field from the 1960s to the 1980s. Moreover, the simple elegance of the relationship between MAC and lipid solubility graphically illustrated Meyer and Oveon's conclusion that \"All chemically indifferent substances that are soluble in fat are anesthetics ... their relative potency as anesthetics will depend on their affinity to fat on the one hand and water on the other hand, that is, on the fat/water paition coefficient\".

Pressure control modes of ventilation In a pressure controlled mode of ventilation, the inspiratory pressure is the control variable, and is maintained during the inspiratory phase. As a result of this, the pressure waveform is \"square\". This increases the mean airway pressure (i.e. the area under the pressure/time graph is greater). Volume - controlled ventilation, where the inflation volume is preselected, and the ventilator automatically adjusts the inflation pressure to deliver the desired volume. the rate of lung inflation can be constant or decelerating. Modes of ventilation Control mode ventilation (CMV) Pressure control ventilation (PCV) Pure control modes (all breath is supplied by Ventilator, breath is not taken by the patient) Synchronized intermittent minute ventilation (SIMV) breath can be supplied by the Ventilator and can be taken by the patient Pressure suppo ventilation (PSV) Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) Pure spontaneous mode (in which all the breath has to be taken by the patient)"

Stellate ganglion blocks have traditionally been performed blindly by palpating the anterior tubercle of the transverse process of C6 (Chassaignac tubercle) and infiltrating a large volume (as much as 20 mL) of local anesthetic followed by the patient sitting up immediately afterwards so that the gravitational effect allows enough volume to reach the stellate ganglion to result in an effective block.

It has propensity to induce methemoglobinemia, which results from accumulation of one its metabolites, oho-toluidine, an oxidizing agent. Development of methemoglobinemia is dependent on the total dose administered, usually appearing after a dose of 8 mg/kg. If necessary, it can be treated by the intravenous administration of methylene blue (1-2 mg/kg). Ref: Drasner K. (2012). Chapter 26. Local Anesthetics. In B.G. Katzung, S.B. Masters, A.J.

It may also reduce resource utilization because lesser drug is required to ensure amnesia, facilitating a faster wake up time and a shorter stay in recovery room.The BIS number decreases with increasing hypnosis.The BIS is derived from complex EEG analysis incorporating weighted information derived from the degree of burst suppression, spectral (b band) power and the bispectrum coherence.To make the EEG signals easier to interpret it uses 2 principles which are, which are, spectral analysis (power) and fast fourier analysis.It uses 3 EEG electrodes placed on frontal, parietal and temporal lobesQBIS is used to monitor: Intraoperative aw arenessQ.

In 1884, Austrian ophthalmologist Karl Koller (1857-1944) instilled a 2% solution of cocaine into his own eye and tested its effectiveness as a local anesthetic by pricking the eye with needles. His findings were presented a few weeks later at annual conference of the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society. The following year, William Halsted (1852-1922) performed the first brachial plexus block. Also in 1885, James Leonard Corning (1855-1923) injected cocaine between the spinous processes of the lower lumbar veebrae, first in a dog and then in a healthy man. His experiments are the first published descriptions of the principle of neuraxial blockade. On August 16, 1898, German surgeon August Bier (1861-1949) performed surgery under spinal anesthesia in Kiel. Following the publication of Bier's experiments in 1899, a controversy developed about whether Bier or Corning performed the first successful spinal anesthetic."

By blocking Na+ channels they block nerve conduction by decreasing the entry (Influx) of Na+ ions during upstroke of action potential.* LAS prolong the inactive state - channel takes longer to recover ->> refractory period of the fiber is increased.* LAS first penetrate the axonal membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Na+ channel front inside.* Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na+ channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor.* So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly.* Degree of blockade is frequency dependent - greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation.* Exposure to higher concentration of Ca+2 reduces inactivation of Na+ channels and lessens the block.Sequence of events* Order of blockade of fibers B > C > Ad > Ag, b > Aa (i.e., Type B fibers are most susceptible).* Accordingly order of block is autonomic (Preganglionic sympathetic) > Sensory > motor.

    "explanation": "The hemodynamic stability seen with etomidate is caused by its lack of effect on the sympathetic nervous system and on the function of the baroreceptor. The minimal effect of etomidate on cardiovascular function sets it apa from other rapid-onset anesthetics. Etomidate has proven useful in patients with valvular or ischemic hea disease who are undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures and in patients with poor cardiac function. In patients receiving etomidate during induction of anesthesia, more hypeension and tachycardia occur after etomidate compared with propofol. The myocardial oxygen supply-to-demand ratio is well maintained. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate lacks analgesic efficacy, however, and must be combined with an opiate to prevent hemodynamic peurbations during laryngoscopy and intubation. In the setting of hemorrhagic shock, etomidate has advantages for the induction of anesthesia. In contrast to other drugs, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of etomidate were minimally altered in a pig model of hemorrhagic shock.

Used for opioid postoperative FACTORS INFLUENCING POSTOPERATIVE NAUSEA AND VOMITING The etiology of emesis is multifactorial. The factors influencing the PONV are as follows: Patient factors Preoperative factors Intraoperative factors: Surgical factors Anesthesia factors Postoperative factors Patient factors Sex: Women are more likely to experience PONV compared to men. It is the strongest patient-specific predictor Motion sickness: Patients with history of motion sickness or vomiting after previous surgery are at increased risk for PONV Smoking: Nonsmokers are more prone for PONV. In smokers, gradual desensitization of CTZ occurs Age: Age <50 years is a significant risk factor for PONV Obesity: Recent data suggest that body mass index is not correlated with an increased risk for development of PONV Delayed gastric emptying: Patients with abdominal pathology, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, increased intracranial tension, history of swallowing blood, and with full stomach are at increased risk of PONV. Preoperative factors Perioperative fasting: It is unceain as risk factor Anxiety: Clinically not relevant for PONV prediction. Intraoperative factors Surgical factors: Type of surgery: Cholecystectomy and gynecological and laparoscopic surgeries are associated with high incidence of PONV Duration of surgery: Longer duration surgeries are associated with increased incidence of PONV. Increasing operative duration by 30 min may increase the risk of PONV by 60%. Anesthesia factors: General anesthesia: * Nitrous oxide: Significant decrease in postoperative emesis was noted if nitrous oxide was avoided in patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures. Three mechanisms have been suggested as contributing factors to the increase in postoperative emesis associated with nitrous oxide 1. Stimulation of sympathetic nervous system with catecholamine release 2. Middle ear pressure changes resulting in traction of the membrane of round window and consequent stimulation of the vestibular system 3. Increased abdominal distension resulting from exchange of nitrous oxide and nitrogen in gas introduced into gastrointestinal tract during mask ventilation * Inhalational agents: Ether and cyclopropane cause a higher incidence of PONV due to increase in endogenous catecholamines. Sevoflurane, enflurane, desflurane, and halothane are associated with lesser degree of PONV. Effect of volatile anesthetics on PONV is dose-dependent and prominent in the first 2-6 h after surgery. Volatile anesthetics were the primary cause of early PONV (0-2 h after surgery); they did not have an impact on delayed PONV (2-24 h after surgery) * Etomidate: Continuous etomidate infusion as a pa of balanced anesthetic technique markedly increases the incidence of postoperative emesis * Ketamine: Studies have shown that ketamine used for induction resulted in delayed discharge, vivid dreams, hallucinations, and higher incidence of PONV compared to a patient receiving barbiturates with nitrous oxide. Emetic effect is secondary to endogenous catecholamine release * Propofol: It is popular for outpatient anesthesia due to its orable recovery characteristics including rapid emergence and reduced PONV * Balanced anesthesia: Compared to inhalational or total intravenous (IV) technique, the use of nitrous oxide-opioid-relaxant technique is associated with higher incidence of postoperative emesis. Emesis with balanced anesthesia has been attributed to use of an opioid-nitrous oxide combination, directly stimulating CTZ * Opioids: It causes emesis through stimulation of opioid receptors located in CTZ. The contribution of intraoperative opioids is weak; there is no difference among different opioids * Neuromuscular reversal agents: Incidence of PONV is unceain. Regional anesthesia: Risk for PONV was 9 times less among patients receiving regional anesthesia than those receiving general anesthesia.The incidence of postoperative emesis following regional nerve block procedures is usually lower than with general anesthesia. Emesis with central neuraxial block is greater than that with peripheral nerve block because of associated sympathetic nervous system blockade, which contributes to postural hypotension induced nausea and vomiting. The incidence of nausea after epidural opioid may be lower with more lipid soluble opioids such as fentanyl and sufentanil, which have less rostral spread from lumbar epidural injection site to CTZ and vomiting center, than the less lipid soluble opioids such as morphine. POSTOPERATIVE FACTORS Pain: Visceral or pelvic pain is a common cause of postoperative emesis Ambulation: Sudden motion, changes in position, transpo from the postanesthetic recovery unit to the postsurgical ward can precipitate nausea and vomiting in patients who have received opioid compounds Opioids: Postoperative opioids increase risk for PONV in a dose-dependent manner; this effect appears to last for as long as opioids are used for pain control in the postoperative period. Irrespective of route of administration, the incidence of nausea and vomiting appears to be similar. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents can be used in perioperative period to reduce opioid requirement Supplemental oxygen is no longer recommended for PONV prevention."

Equipment failure Disconnection Total occlusion Accidental extubation Inadequate mechanical ventilation increased (ETCO2) Bronchospasm paial - steep platen not flat capnogram (Flat capnograph is seen in severe bronchospasm). Capnography Capnography is the monitoring of the concentration or paial pressure of CO2 in the expired gases. Its main development has been as a monitoring tool for use during anaesthesia and intensive care. Capnographs usually work on the principle that CO2 absorbs infrared radiation. A beam of infrared radiation is passed across the gas sample to fall on to a sensor. The presence of CO, in the gas leads to a reduction in the amount of light falling on the sensor which changes the voltage in the circuit. A capnogram plots CO2 concentration over time and consists of four phases : The X axis measures time and the Y-axis shows the concentration of CO2. The phase I The phase I stas with exhalation. The first gases that pass over the capnography sensor usually do not contain carbon-di-oxide because they are the gases that fill the physiological dead spaces in the \"conducting airway\" (Lungs, bronchic, trachea, mouth and nose). This phase is the baseline of the capnograph. Phase II Phase II is known as the expiratory upstroke and trace steep rise in CO2 level. This phase measures a mixture of dead space (No CO2) and alveolar (CO2). Phase III This phase represents the expiratory platen which represents mostly alveolar gas exhalation. The plateu is indicative of the homeostasis of the patient. The gases released at the end of expiratory plateu have the highest concentration of CO2. This is also known as the end tidal point and is what is measured with calorimetry, capnometry or capnography. Phase IV This phase reflects the inhalational phase, which brings oxygenated gases into the lung, returning the gas levels and the capnograph waveform to the beginning of a new cycle and the baseline. Clinical applications Use of ETCO2 monitoring with intubated patients: ETCO2 monitoring is useful in gauging the severity of hypoventilation states such as drug and ethanol intoxication, diabetic ketoacidosis, congestive hea failure, stroke, head injury and/ sedation. Monitoring allows ongoing assessment of the perfusion's status, changes in ventilation status and changes in air movement as measured by ETCO2, can diagnose problems with asthma, COPD, airway edema, stroke or foreign body obstruction. Verification of Endotracheal tube placement There are several ways to evaluate the placement of an endotracheal tube which are :- auscultation of lungs for bit, breath sounds and absence of sounds in the belly, visual assessment of chest movement and clouding of endotracheal tube from the exhaled air. Displacement of the endotracheal tube Displacement of an endotracheal tube is most likely to occur when moving a patient, especially when moving the patient in or out of an ambulance or when dealing with an awake or agitated patient postoperatively. Continuous capnographic monitoring rapidly identifies the problem. The typical waveform for a displaced endotracheal tubes has the normal square like fonns that would gradually, reduce and tail off to the baseline (flat capnogratn). Adequacy of cardiopulmonary resuscitation ETCO37measurement during CPR can both assess effectiveness of the CPR and predict survivability as well. Levels of ETCO2 have predictive correlation to cardiac output. As pulmonary blood flow decreases during cardiac arrest, CO2 levels in the bloodstream are decreased which can be evaluated using a capnograph waveform. Studies have shown that without a return to ETCO2 levels of 10 mmHg or more after 20 minutes of CPR there is 100% moalio. rate. Return of spontaneous circulation ETCO2 monitoring is sensitive enough to register a rapid rise in CO2 production (indicates metabolism) well before either pulse or blood pressure is detectable. Evaluation during Asthma treatment A patient suffering bronchospasm or an asthma attack will have a characteristic \"shark fin\" waveform. This is because the bronchospasm alters the ascending phase and the platen phase with a slower rise in CO2. The effectiveness of treatment can be quickly evaluated by observation of the waveform as it returns to a more nonnal square or step shape. Severe asthma causes flat capnograph. Head injury patient Hyperventilation can increase blood pressure and with head injury patients increased blood pressure can exacerbate cerebral edema. Monitoring of ETCO2 can assist the clinician in maintaining stable CO2 levels thus avoiding secondary injury from accidental increased cerebral edema. Acute and critical care uses In addition to confirming correct Eli placements and predicting moality following cardiac arrest, capnography can play an impoant role in the critical care setting. Capnography offers a rapid alarm for ventilator disconnection, identified by a flat line on capnogram. It also assists with early identification of a dislodged tube in an awake or agitated patients."

The bupivacaine R (+) isomer binds cardiac Na channels more avidly than S (-) isomer. This finding lead to development of levobupivacaine & ropivacaine. Inhibition of epinephrine - Stimulated CAMP formation by LAs could explain the refractoriness of bupivacaine cardiovascular toxicity to standard resuscitation measures. Programmed electrical stimulation elicit more arrythmias with bupivacaine & levobupivacaine then with lidocaine or ropivacaine. Bupivacaine is most cardiotoxic local anaesthetic, so it should not be used for Beir's block.Q It's cardiotoxicity is enhanced in pregnancy. Intravenous bupivacaine and etidocaine may cause severe cardiac reactions which are A.V. hea block Dysarythmias e.g. ventricular fibrillation. - Circulatory collapse & primary cardiac failure (bradycardia, pallor, sweating & hypotension) Amiodarone (drug of choice)Q and Bretylium is used to treat bupivacaine induced ventricular tachycardias.

Oxygenators are devices used in cardiopulmonary bypass surgeries. Currently only two types of oxygenators -Membranous & bubble oxygenators are in use. Membranous oxygenators imitate the natural lung by interspersing a thin membrane between gas and blood phases. This eliminates gaseous micro emboli formation & minimizes blood element trauma.

    ],
    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "The first modern halogenated volatile anesthetic, halothane, was introduced in 1955. Clinical exposure to halothane is associated with two distinct types of hepatic injury. Subclinical hepatotoxicity occurs in 20% of adults who receive halothane. It is characterized by mild postoperative elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspaate aminotransferase, but is reversible and innocuous. Anaerobic halothane reduction by CYP2A6 to a 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethyl radical is thought to mediate this mild hepatic injury. The fulminant form of hepatotoxicity, commonly known as halothane hepatitis, It is characterized by elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspaate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, and massive hepatic necrosis following the administration of halothane. Halothane hepatitis is rare (1 in 5000 to 35,000 administrations in adults), but is fatal in 50% to 75% of these cases. Because of the potential for fatal hepatitis, halothane is no longer used in adult patients in many countries. Halothane hepatitis is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane. The highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane oxidation can react with nearby liver proteins. In most patients who developed hepatic necrosis after halothane anesthesia, antibodies against TFA-modified proteins were detected, suggesting that the hepatic damage is linked to an immune response against the modified protein, which acts as a neoantigen. Accordingly, patients who develop halothane hepatitis often have a history of prior exposures to halothane or other volatile anesthetics, together with symptoms suggestive of immune reactivity, such as fever, rash, ahralgia, and eosinophilia. A current hypothesis is that TFA-protein adducts induce a cytotoxic T cell reaction in sensitized individuals, which leads to liver damage. However, the immune responses observed in halothane hepatitis might not mediate liver injury. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e"

Katzung pharma, 9th/Chapter 26; Anaesthesia by Ajay Yadav 3rd/pg. 111)When local anesthetic-induced seizures occur, hypoxia, hypercarbia and acidosis develop rapidly. ABC (Airway, Breathing and Circulation) is the mainstay of treatment. Administration of O2 by mask, or ventilation support by bag and mask, is often all that is necessary to treat seizures. If seizures interfere with ventilation, benzodiazepines, small dose propofol or thiopental can be used. The use of succinylcholine effectively facilitates ventilation and, by abolishing muscular activity, decreases the severity of acidosis. However neuronal seizure activity is not inhibited and therefore, cerebral metabolism and oxygen requirements remain increased.LOCALANAESTHETICSMechanism of action of local anesthetics# Diffusion of the unionized (base) form across the nerve sheath and membrane# Re-equilibration between the base and cationic forms in the axoplasm# Binding of the cation to a receptor site inside of the Na+ channel, resulting in its blockade and consequent inhibition of Na+ conductance.Order of blockade: small fibre > large fibres; myelinated fibres > unmyelinated fibres. Modality blocked: autonomic and pain > touch/pressure > motor.

CNS Toxicity# Lightheadedness, tinnitus, perioral numbness, confusion (especially known with Lignocaine)# Muscle twitching, auditory and visual hallucinations# Tonic-clonic seizure, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest# Benzodiazepines or rapidly acting barbiturates administered intravenously are the drugs of choice for both the prevention and arrest of convulsions.# Transient neurological symptoms is side-effect of LIGNOCAINE# Seizures induced by local anesthetics can also be treated with small doses (given intravenously) of thiopental 1-2 mg/ kg, propofol 0.5-1 mg/kg, midazolam 2-4 mg total dose, or diazepam 0.1 mg/kg.B.

Exaggerated lumbar lordosis In a pregnant female, there is decreased requirement of the spinal anaesthetic agent because of decreased volume of sub arachnoid space, engorgement of epidural veins and increased sensitivity of the nerves to anaesthetic agent (but not due to exaggerated lumbar lordosis). Spinal Anesthesia Spinal anesthesia blocks nerve roots as they course through the subarachnoid space. The spinal subarachnoid space extends from the foramen magnum to the S2 in adults and S3 in childrendeg. Injection of local anesthetic below Ll in adults and L3 in children helps avoid direct trauma to the spinal corddeg. Spinal anesthesia is also referred to a subarachnoid block or intrathecal injection Factors affecting the Level of Spinal Anesthesia Most impoant factors Other factors Baricity of anesthetic solutionQ Age Position of the patientQ CSF volumeQ During injectionQ Curvature of the spineQ Immediately after injectionQ Drug volumeQ Drug dosageQ Intra-abdominal pressureQ Site of injectionQ Needle directionQ Patient heightQ PregnancyQ CSF volume inversely correlates with level of anesthesia. Increased intra-abdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, thus decreasing CSF volume, are associated with higher blocksdeg. This would include conditions such as pregnancyQ, ascites, and large abdominal tumorsQ In these clinical situations, higher levels of anesthesia are achieved with a given dose of local anesthetic than would otherwise be expected. For spinal anesthesia on a term paurient, the dosage of anesthetic can be reduced by one-third compared with a non-pregnant patientQ. Age-related decreases in CSF volume are likely responsible for the higher than expected level, paicularly with a hypobaric technique or rapid injection. During pregnancy progesterone also increases sensitivity of nerves to local anesthetics thus decreasing the doseQ."

Intravenous regional anesthesia or Bier's block involves the intravenous administration of a local anesthetic into a tourniquet- occluded limb. It is used to provide anesthesia for sho surgical procedures (<90 minutes) on the limbs. Note : Bupivacaine and its congeners is not used for Biers block. It is the most cardiotoxic local anesthetic.

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Induction of anesthesia with propofol is often associated with pain on injection, apnea, hypotension, and, rarely, thrombophlebitis of the vein into which propofol is injected.Pain on injection is reduced by using a large vein, avoiding veins in the dorsum of the hand, and adding lidocaine to the propofol solution or changing the propofol formulation. Multiple other drugs and distraction techniques have been investigated to reduce the pain on injection of propofol. Pretreatment with a small dose of propofol, opiates, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, ketamine, esmolol or metoprolol, magnesium, a flash of light, a clonidine-ephedrine combination, dexamethasone, and metoclopramide all have been tested with variable efficacy. Ketamine has been administered by the IV, intramuscular (IM), transcutaneous, oral, nasal, and rectal routes and as a preservative-free solution epidurally or intrathecally. Most clinical use involves the IV and IM routes, by which the drug rapidly achieves therapeutic concentrations. The dose depends on the desired therapeutic effect and on the route of administration. There is no pain on injection. Although etomidate provides stable hemodynamics and minimal respiratory depression, it is associated with several adverse effects when it is used for induction, including nausea and vomiting, pain on injection, myoclonic movement, and hiccups. Etomidate has been associated with PONV. More recently, etomidate in a lipid emulsion was associated with equal or an increased incidence of postoperative nausea compared with propofol. The lipid formulation of etomidate is associated with a much less frequent incidence of pain on injection, thrombophlebitis, and histamine release. Pain on injection may be reduced by injecting IV lidocaine, 20 to 40 mg immediately before injection of etomidate. Ref: Millers anesthesia 8th edition"

In dose-response studies, the ED50 for thiopental ranged from 2.2 to 2.7 mg/kg, and the ED50 for methohexital was 1.1 mg/kg. Less interpatient variability is seen in the dose-response to barbiturates than to benzodiazepines when used for anesthesia induction, but significant variability remains in the dose of thiopental required to induce anesthesia. Interpatient dose variability is related to the presence of hemorrhagic shock, cardiac output, lean body mass, obesity, gender, and age. Hemorrhagic shock, lean body mass, age, and obesity explain the variability of patients' responses resulting from a decrease in the central volume of distribution. Finally, patients who have severe anemia, burns, malnutrition, widespread malignant disease, uremia, ulcerative colitis, or intestinal obstruction also require smaller induction doses of barbiturates.

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Sevoflurane * Unlike desflurane, sevoflurane poses no problem in induction, acceptability is good even in pediatric patients.* Therefore, sevoflurane is the inhalational agent of choice for induction.* Ketamine is the i/v anesthetic of choice in children.Anesthesia in Children -InductionInhalational induction* Inhalational agent with mask is the induction method of choice in children.* Sevoflurane is the inhalation agent of choice for induction. Sevoflurane is used in N2O+O2 gas mixture. Halothane is second choice inhalational agent for induction. Isoflurane and desflurane are not used for induction as they are more pungent and associated with more coughing 8c laryngospasm.Intravenous induction* Intravenous induction is preferred when induction by mask is contraindicated i.e., in full stomach patients or of child comes in the operation theatre with IV line in situ.* Thiopentol or propofol are commonly used agents. Propofol is particularly suitable for out patient surgery. Ketamine is preferred in children with hypovolemia. Etomidate can be used in child with unstable cardiovascular status as it is most cardio-vascular stable intravenous inducing agent.Maintenance* As sevoflurane cause emergence delirium and agitation, it is not used for maintenance. After induction with sevoflurane anaesthesia, isoflurane or Halothane are used for maintenance anaesthesia. During maintenance, anaesthetic gas mixture contain N2O+O2 +Halothane or isoflurane. Halothane is commonly used for induction and maintenance in children.* If sevoflurane is continued for maintenance, administration of an opioid (Fentanyl) 15-20 min before the end of the procedure can reduce the incidence of emergence delirium and agitation.Muscle relaxantsDepolarizing blockers* Children are more susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia, Hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis after administration of succinylcholine. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following administration of sucinylcholine, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. For this reason, succinylcholine is best avoided for routine elective surgery in children.* Generally accepted indications for succinylcholine are1) Rapid sequence induction, 2) Laryngospasm, and 3) Rapid muscle relaxation prior to intravenous access (e.g., regurgitation).* Profound bradycardia and sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following first dose of succinyl choline, if given without pretreatment with atropine. Therefore, atropine must always be administered prior to succinylcholine in children.* Children with muscular dystrophy are more prone to develop hyperkalemia: Arrhythmia and cardiac arrest may occur - Should be avoided in such patients.Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants* Functional maturation of NM junction is not complete unti 12 months of age, therefore new born sarevery sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.* Kidney and liver functions are immature in neonate - Atracurium/cisatracurium is the muscle relaxant of choice in newborn as it does not require renal or hepatic elimination. For the same reason mivacurium can also be used.* In older children the choice of non-depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on the side effects, and onset & duration of action: -i) Mivacurium for procedures lasting 10-15 min.ii) Atracurium/cisatracurium for precedures lasting around 30 min.iii) Pancuronium when tachycardia is desired e.g., with fentanyliv) Vecuronium (fastest acting non-depolarizing NM blocker) for intubation in place of SCH.v) Atracurium/cisatracurium in patients with renal or hepatic disease."

Newer anesthetics (such as desflurane) typically have smaller blood-gas paition coefficients than older ones (such as ether); these are preferred because they lead to faster onset of anesthesia and faster emergence from anesthesia once application of the anesthetic is stopped. If an anesthetic has a high coefficient, then a large amount of it will have to be taken up in the body's blood before being passed on to the fatty (lipid) tissues of the brain where it can exe its effect.

    "explanation": "B. Selectively binds to rocuroniumSugammadex Morgan 5th/23lSugammadex is a novel selective relaxant-binding agentIts three-dimensional structure resembles a hollow truncated cone or doughnut with a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic exterior.Hydrophobic interactions trap the drug (e.g., rocuronium) in the cyclodextrin cavity (doughnut hole), resulting in tight formation of a water-soluble guest-host complex in a 1:1 ratio. This terminates the neuromuscular blocking action and restrains the drug in extracellular fluid where it cannot interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.It is essentially eliminated unchanged via the kidneys.It produces rapid and effective reversal of both shallow and profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in a consistent manner.* Barash 6th/Chap 20Sugammadex, previously called ORG 25969, leads to restoration of normal neuromuscular function not by interfering with acetylcholine, the nicotinic receptor or acetylcholinesterase, but by selectively binding to rocuronium, and to a lesser extent to vecuronium and pancuronium.Selective relaxant binding agent for reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by rocuronium or vecuronium in adults undergoing surgery\"-reference.medscape.comThe compound is a cyclodextrin, made up of eight sugars arranged in a ring to make a center to accommodate the rocuronium molecule. Once bound, rocuronium is held in place by polar side chains attached to the ring.Because sugammadex does not bind to any known receptory it is devoid of major cardiovascular or other side effects.It does not bind neuromuscular blocking drugs that do not have a steroid nucleus.The benzylisoquinolines, such as atracurium, cisatracurium and mivacurium, and succinylcholine are unaffected by sugammadex.After injection of sugammadex, evidence suggests that binding of rocuronium to sugammadex in plasma leads to a marked decrease in free (unbound) rocuronium concentration, 153 leading to the establishment of a concentration gradient of rocuronium between the neuromuscular junction and plasma. This favors movement of rocuronium from neuromuscular junction to plasma, producing less neuromuscular block. Vecuronium has less affinity for sugammadex than rocuronium does, and pancuronium has less still.Sugammadex could also be used in the case of a failed intubation. If rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was given, sugammadex 8 mg/kg might be effective as early as 3 minutes after rocuronium injection, and if the dose of rocuronium is doubled to 1.2 mg/ kg, one might need 16 mg/kg of sugammadex. The availability of sugammadex might make succinylcholine obsolete for intubation."

Injury or weakness to this muscle leads to ptosis. This muscle is supplied by occulomotor (3') nerve. Deep pa of the elevator muscle is the Muller's muscle, which is sympathetically innvervated. In hypehyroidism, sensitization of the Muller muscle leads to upper eyelid retraction and pseudoproptosis. On the other hand, in Horner's syndrome loss of this muscle action leads to ptosis. The capsulopalpebral fascia assists in lower eyelid retraction and coordinates with eyeball movement. It arises as an extension of the inferior rectus and inses into the lower edge of the lower tarsus and the adjacent orbital septum."

    ],
    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Ethylene Glycol poisoning presents in three phases depending on timing: initially (30-60 minutes) after ingestion acute intoxication occurs. This may also result in excitatory symptoms, cerebral oedema, convulsions and coma. The second phase occurs at 12-18 hours with predominantly cardiovascular effects including dysrhythmias and cardiac failure. Profound metabolic acidosis often causes death during this phase. Phase three occurs at 2-3 days with predominantly renal failure and acute tubular necrosis due to calcium deposition. Finally, a delayed neurologic phase can occur 5-20 days post-ingestion, presenting with neurological effects including profound limb weakness, cranial nerve palsies and sensory disturbance. EG causes an increased anion gap acidosis. Other causes of a raised anion gap acidosis include lactate, toxins (ethanol, ethylene glycol, methanol, paraldehyde, aspirin, cyanide, iron, isoniazid), and ketoacidosis (diabetes, alcohol). Causes of a normal anion gap acidosis include gastrointestinal losses (diarrhea), renal loss of bicarbonate (proximal renal tubular acidosis), renal failure and hyperchloraemic acidosis. Renal replacement therapy is a very effective treatment for EG poisoning, as it corrects acid-base status and eliminates EG and some of the harmful metabolites. Fomepizole is a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase preventing the production of toxic metabolites of EG. It is given as a loading dose 15mg/kg and then 10mg/kg every 12 hours for the next 48 hours. After which, the dose is increased to 15mg/kg 12hourly. It is continued until plasma EG levels are less than 20mg/dL.Reference: Glossop AJ, Bryden DC. Case repo: an unusual presentation of ethylene glycol poisoning.

Atracurium triggers dose dependent histamine release that becomes significant at dose above 5mg/kg. The release is dose dependent such that with increasing dose administered at the same rate there is greater propensity for eliciting histamine release resulting in bronchospasm and hemodynamic instability."

    "explanation": "Traditionally, patients are considered to be at risk if their gastric volume is greater than 25 mL (0.4 mL/kg) and their gastric pH is less than 2.5. Some investigators believe that controlling acidity is more impoant than volume and that the criteria should be revised to a pH less than 3.5 with a volume greater than 50 mL. Patients who have eaten immediately prior to emergency surgery are obviously at risk. Traditionally, \"NPO after midnight\" implied a preoperative fast of at least 6 h. The current opinion allows clear liquids until 2 h before the induction of anesthesia. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guideline, breast milk is permitted up to 4 h before anesthesia. Infant formula, nonhuman milk, and a light meal are permitted up to 6 h before induction. Patients consuming a heavy meal including meat, fats, and fried foods should fast for 8 h. Ceain patient populations are paicularly likely to have large volumes of acidic gastric fluid: patients with an acute abdomen or peptic ulcer disease, children, the elderly, diabetic patients, pregnant women, and obese patients. Fuhermore, pain, anxiety, or opioids may delay gastric emptying. Note that pregnancy and obesity place patients in double jeopardy by increasing the chance of aspiration (increased intraabdominal pressure and distoion of the lower esophageal sphincter) and the risk of aspiration pneumonia (increased acidity and volume of gastric contents). Aspiration is more common in patients undergoing esophageal, upper abdominal, or emergency laparoscopic surgery. Ref: Morgan & Mikhail&;s clinical anesthesiology 6e"

These incidents of dreaming and illusion are often associated with excitement, confusion, euphoria, and fear. They occur in the first hour of emergence and usually abate within 1 to several hours. These psychic emergence reactions are secondary to ketamine-induced depression of auditory and visual relay nuclei, thus leading to misperception or misinterpretation of auditory and visual stimuli.

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Ans.: C: Propofol Propofol is a sho-acting, intravenously administered hypnotic agent. Its uses include the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, sedation for mechanically ventilated adults, and procedural sedation. Propofol is unrelated to barbiturates, and has largely replaced sodium thiopental (Pentothal) for induction of anaesthesia because recovery from propofol is more rapid and \"clear\" when compared with thiopental. Propofol is not considered an analgesic, so opioids such as fentanyl may be combined with propofol to allete pain and it is the agent of choice for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). It is used to produce sedation in ICU. It is the agent of choice for induction in susceptible individuals for malignant hypehermia. Due to its amnestic effects and appearance as a white liquid, propofol has been humorously dubbed \"milk of amnesia\"."

If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N20), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intralveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli --> Concentration effect. If another inhalation agent is (eg Halothane) is being given at the same time, it also will be delivered to lung from the cylinder (due to negative intraalveolar pressure) --> Second gas effect. During recovery reverse occurs - N20 having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air --> paial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced. The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia. Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% 02 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N20, instead of straight away switching over to air.

So option C is excluded. And decreased 02 saturation (80%) with oxygen (most probably through mask or nasal tube) indicate that patient needs tracheal intubation. The tube in trachea can be put nose (nasotracheal), oral cavity (orotracheal) or trachea itself (tracheostomy). - Ideally tracheostomy should be performed under GA. And technically tracheostomy with an awake local anesthetic in a patient with severe airway compromise is difficult because the ideal positioning with an extended head and supine is often not tolerated by patient, and the procedure is to be undeaken in a semi upright sitting position. Because tracheostomy is a relatively time taking procedure in comparison to intubation, it does not have much role in emergency airway managementQ. Tracheostomy is usually done when immediate 02 requirements are taken care of by rapid intubation and prolonged intubation is plannedQ (>1 to 2-3 weeks). However, if intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an emergency procedure. So option D is excluded. Orotracheal intubation using rapid sequence induction is the technique of choice for resuscitationQ. And nasotracheal intubation is preferred in awake patients. But it is impoant to understand that in case of maxillary fracture, awake intubation is not possible. Nasotrached intubation is contraindica in severe mid facial injuryQ. So for maxillary fracture, orotracheal intubation is method of choice for immediate management of hypoxia."

This may result in a found continuous precordial murmur, the so called \"Mill wheel murmur\". Two conditions must exist for venous air embolism to occur : - A direct communication between a source of air and the vasculature and - A pressure gradient ouring the passage of air into the circulation. Air embolism can occur whenever a blood vessel is open and a pressure gradient exists ouring entry of gas. Because the pressure in most aeries and veins is greater than atmospheric pressure an air embolus does not always happen when a blood vessel is injured. In the veins above the hea, such as in the head and neck, the pressure is less than atmospheric and an injury may let air in. This is one reason why surgeons must be paicularly careful when operating on the brain. The key factors determining the degree of morbidity and moality in venous air emboli are ? The volume of the gas entrapped. The rate of accumulation and The patient's position at the time of event. Generally small amounts of air are broken up in the capillary bed and absorbed from the circulation without producing symptoms. Traditionally it has been estimated that more than 5 ml/kg of air displaced into the intravenous space is required for significant injury (shock or cardiac arrest to occu). It a large amount of air gets lodged in the hea; it stops the flow of the blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. This results in significant rise in pulmonary aery pressures. This increase in pulmonary aery pressures can lead to right ventricular outflow obstruction and fuher compromise pulmonary venous return to the left hea. The diminished pulmonary venous return will lead to decreased left ventricular preload with resultant decreased cardiac output and eventual systemic cardiovascular collapse. In patients with patent foramen ovale the air entrapped can travel to the left side of the hea and on to the brain or coronary aeries. This can lead to most serious of air embolism symptoms. Diagnosis Dopple ultrasounddeg is the most sensitive noninvasive method to detect air embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than Doppler ultrasound but is also more invasivedeg and technically more difficult to place and to interpret. The pulmonary aery catheter is the next most sensitive monitor. Mass spectrometry.for end tidal nitrogen is as sensitive as the pulmonary aery catheter. End tidal carbon di-oxide measurement decreases during air embolism. - But decrease in ETCO2 is not specific for air embolism. Hypoventilatiorz, low cardiac output, other types of emboli and COPD can also decrease ETCO2. The least sensitive method to detect air embolism is the precordial or esophageal stethoscope. On stethoscope - \"mill wheel murmur\" is detected Clinical signs of Air embolism Abrupt fall in end tidal CO2 is usually the first sign Hypotension Tachycardia Cyanosis Mill wheel murmur Cardiovascular collapse"

    "question": "A victim of blunt abdominal trauma has splenic and liver lacerations as well as an unstable pelvic fracture.

    ],
    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient is in class IV hemorrhagic shock, which represents a loss of more than 40% of circulating blood volume. He requires massive blood transfusion. The term massive blood transfusion is defined as a single transfusion greater than 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfused over a period of 24 hours. There is evidence to suggest that severely injured trauma patients arrive at the hospital coagulopathic. Fuhermore, when large amounts of banked blood are transfused, the recipient develops dilutional thrombocytopenia and deficiencies in factors V and VIII. Recent studies have suggested that early administration of freshfrozen plasma (FFP) and platelets decreases moality and that a 1:1 ratio of PRBC:FFP should be initiated upon recognition of the need for massive transfusion. Waiting to administer FFP and platelets until laboratory values confirm coagulopathy is no longer recommended. Moreover, excessive crystalloid infusion should be avoided. Albumin has no role in damage control resuscitation. Vitamin K will take days to replace the clotting factors. This patient needs to have his coagulopathy corrected immediately to prevent death from hemorrhagic shock."

If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N2O), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intra-alveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli - Concentration effect.o During recovery reverse occurs - N2O having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air - partial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced.o The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia (Fink effect).o Diffusion hypoxia occurs in first 5-10 minutes of recovery.o Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% O2 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N2O, instead of straight away switching over to air. Besides N2O, Xenon also causes diffusion hypoxia."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "If a inhalational agent is highly metabolized and produces huge amount of fluoride it can cause nephrotoxicity. We need more than 50 micromol/litre of fluoride in blood to be nephrotoxic. Methoxyflurane is the most nephrotoxic among inhalational anesthetics- it causes polyuric renal failure due to a large amount of inorganic fluoride released, and it is no longer used in clinical practice. The renal toxicity of volatile anesthetics is due to their metabolic breakdown to free fluoride ions. The amount of fluoride ions produced: Methoxyflurane: 80uM Sevoflurane: 20-30 uM Enflurane: 20uM Isoflurane and desflurane: 5uMWhen compared to methoxyflurane, the lower incidence of nephrotoxicity among the newer inhaled anesthetics is due to lesser metabolic breakdown, lower solubility in the kidney which results in lesser amount of intrarenal fluoride which is liberated and also due to their faster clearance."

CPAP may be especially useful in patients with congestive heart failure or obstructive sleep apnea.Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is probably the most common mode of support and requires provision of inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). The difference between IPAP and EPAP is a reflection of the amount of pressure support ventilation provided to the patient, and EPAP is synonymous with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).Some noninvasive ventilation is provided using proportional-assist ventilation (PAV), which provides flow and volume assistance with each breath."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Ans. A. Sevolfurane. (Ref. Lee's Synopsis of Anaesthesia 13th/pg. 136)Sevoflurane, with low blood gas solubility allows rapid induction and early emergence.Due to its pleasant odor, it is nonirritant to the airway which makes it an attractive alternative for inhalational induction in children.An area where sevoflurane might be expected to find increasing use is that of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion which is becoming more frequent in paediatric ambulatory surgery as this avoids some of the hazards of endotracheal intubation.Inhalational Anaesthetics# HALOTHANE# ISOFLURANE# NITROUS OXIDE# SEVOFLURANESEVOFLURANE# used widely for induction in children as is not irritant to the airway and has good cardiovascular stability# apnea can occur with prolonged use of high concentrations; use for a brief time only# emergence times are usually short following sevoflurane anaesthesia (unless administration is prolonged); ensure adequate analgesia is given to cover the early recovery period# agitation during recovery appears to be common in children# there is a theoretical risk of nephrotoxicity due to Compound A which is formed by the breakdown of sevoflurane by carbon dioxide absorbents; reduce sevoflurane degradation by avoiding prolonged use in low-flow systems (<2 L/ minute).# Induction: Up to 8% inspired concentration in oxygen with or without nitrous oxide produces surgical anaesthesia in <2 minutes.# Maintenance: 0.5-3% inspired concentration in oxygen with or without nitrous oxide; use concentrations in lower end of range when using nitrous oxide.HALOTHANE# Mode of action- Halothane is a volatile liquid anaesthetic. It's advantages are that it is potent, induction is smooth, pleasant to inhale, the vapor is not irritant to the skin and mucous membranes and does not produce necrosis when split on tissues. It suppresses salivary, mucous, bronchial, and gastric secretions and dilates the bronchioles.- IndicationsInduction but more often for the maintenance of general anaesthesia.- Specific considerationsHalothane reduces muscle tone in pregnant uterus and generally its use is not recommended in obstetrics because of the increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage.- Halothane should not be used for patients with cardiac arrhythmias.- Halothane was considered to be unsafe in patients with acute porphyria.# Adverse Effects- Cardiovascular: Halothane has a depressant action on the cardiovascular systemand reduces blood pressure; signs of overdosage are bradycardia and profound hypotension. It is also a respiratory depressant and can cause cardiac arrhythmias; there have been instances of cardiac arrest. The sensitivity of the heart to sympathomimetic amines is increased.- Hepatic: dysfunction, hepatitis, and necrosis have been reported following the use of halothane, more frequent following repeated use. Serious hepatotoxicity has limited its use in recent years.- Other: malignant hyperpyrexia, involuntary muscle movements, hiccup, coughing, bronchospasm, laryngospasm and respiratory depression.# Drug interactions1. Adrenaline: the concurrent use of adrenaline with halothane may lead to seious side effects since fatalities have been reported in some patients associated with ventricular fibrillation.2. Calcium-Channel Blockers: verapamil has been reported to cause cardiac arrest when given with halothane.3. Morphine, chlorpromazine: both drugs increase the depressant effects of halothane.4. Suxamethonium: reports of potentiation of suxamethonium-induced muscle damage by prior anaesthetic induction using halothane have been observed.# Sodium Bicarbonate: sodium bicarbonate, given to induce metabolic alkalosis, decreased total peripheral resistance during halothane anaesthsia and might lead to severe hypotension.# Dosage- Anaesthesia may be induced with 2 to 4% v/v of halothane in oxygen or mixtures of nitrous oxide and oxygen; It takes up to about 5 minutes to attain surgical anaesthesia and halothane produces little or no excitement in the induction period. For induction in children a concentration of 1.5 to 2% v/v has been used.. The more usual practice is to induce anaesthesia with an intravenous agent. Anaesthesia is maintained with concentrations of 0.5 to 2% v/v depending on the flow rate used; the lower concentration is usually suitable for the elderly.ISOFLURANE# Mode of actionThought to enhance inhibitory ion channel activity and inhibit excitatory activity in the brain to induce hypnosis and amnesia, and in the spinal cord to cause immobility in response to painful stimuli.# IndicationsInduction and maintenance of general anaesthesia.# ContraindicationsSpecific considerationsPregnancy: Limited data; ADEC category B3. Reduce maintenance dose in obstetric anaesthesia.Breastfeeding: No data.# Adverse effectsCommon: On induction, coughing, breath-holding, laryngospasm.# DosageInduction: 1.5-3% inspired concentration in oxygen and nitrous oxide produces surgical anaesthesia within 10 minutes; alternatively, start at an inspired concentration of 0.5% and increase gradually to the required level.# Maintenance: 0.5-2.5% inspired concentration in oxygen and nitrous oxide; 1.5-3.5% inspired concentration when used with oxygen alone.NITROUS OXIDEIntroduction:# in anaesthesia, it is mainly used as an adjunct to other inhalational anaesthetics, allowing them to be used at lower concentrations# it is a weak anaesthetic but has strong analgesic properties; used in subanaesthetic concentrations in obstetrics, emergency care and procedures not requiring loss of consciousness; premixed nitrous oxide 50% and oxygen 50% alone is suitable for self-administration# prolonged inhalation can inactivate vitamin B12 and interfere with DNA synthesis causing haematological and neuro- logical adverse effects; avoid exposures of >6 hours# whether or not chronic low level occupational exposure is harmful to staff remains unresolved; control nitrous oxide pollution using a scavenging system and effective ventilation# protect cylinders containing 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen from the cold; if cooled to temperatures < -7degC, liquid nitrous oxide separates and may require remixing before use# Mode of actionNitrous oxide is an anesthetic administred by inhalation. It is a weak anaesthetic with minimum alveolar concentration value of 110%. It has strong analgesic properties, but produces little muscle relaxation.# IndicationsNitrous oxide is used as an adjuvant to other anaesthetics and permits them to be used at a significantly reduced dosage. It is given with oxygen for anaesthesia especially in obstetrics. Recovery is usually rapid from nitrous oxide anaesthesia.# Specific considerationsAir-containing cavities (e.g. middle ear occlusion, abdominal distension, pneumothorax, air embolus), or during or after pneumoencephalography or vitreoretinal surgery involving gases such as sulphur hexafluoride: risk of increased pressure and/or volume within such cavities.Vitamin B12 deficiency: increased risk of neurological dysfunction, including subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord with prolonged exposure.Pregnancy: Safe to use; ADEC category A.# Adverse effectsThe main complications are those due to varying degrees of hypoxia..Rare: With prolonged (eg >24 hours) or repeated use: megaloblastic anaemia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, neuropathy, myeloneuropathy.DosageInduction: 70% with 30% oxygen, (in combination with other anaesthetic agent).Maintenance: 30-70% with oxygen, (in combination with other anaesthetic agent).Analgesia: 25-50% with oxygen."

This is because the cycle of30 chest compressionsbefore rescue breathing delays ventilation for only15 to 20 seconds. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation of infants and children, the ratio of chest compression to rescue breaths is 30:2 for a single rescuer and 15:2 if 2 or more rescuers are present. The initial energy to be set for defibrillation is at 2 J/kg for both monophasic and biphasic waveforms.It can be increased to 4 J/kg if a second shock is to be delivered. In adults, the ratio is 30:2irrespective of the number of rescuers. In infants and children, the depth of compression should be at least one-third of the anteroposterior diameter of the chest which is about 5 cm in children and 4 cm in infants. The compression rate should be 100-120/ minute. Allow complete chest recoil after each compression. Minimize interruptions in compressions (10 seconds or less). Rotate compressor every 2 minutes or earlier if fatigued. Avoid excessive ventilation."

Mitral stenosis is a disorder where cardiac output remains relatively fixed. Decrease in cardiac output should he avoided at any cost. - Any drug that increases the hea rate will reduce the cardiac output in patient with M.S. All the inhalational agents mentioned in the question decrease systemic vascular resistance and also increase the hea rate. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance leads to fall in blood pressure. Moreover, they may also decrease B.P. by their cardiodepressant action on myocardium. Therefore these drugs should not be used in patients with M.S. \"Xenon has no effects on cardiac output or cardiac rhythum and is not thought to have significant effect on systemic vascular resistance It also does not affect pulmonary function and is not known to have any renal or hepatic toxicity\". The main drawback of Xenon is its high cost and insufficient availability. -Xenon is an ine gas which is quite difficult to obtain and hence extremely expensive. - Xenon has received considerable interest in the last few years because it has many characteristics approaching those of an \"ideal\" inhaled anaesthetics. Mitral stenosis Due to mitral stenosis less blood .flows through the mitral valve to left ventricle. Left ventricle functions normally but is small and poorly.filled. Initially the left ventricle dilates keeping the pulmonary aery pressure low. As disease progresses pulmonary aery pressure increases and medial hyperophy develops resulting in chronic reactive pulmonary hypeension. The right hea hyperophies to pump against a pressure overload, then.fails. The pressure gradient across the narrow mitral orifice increase with the square of cardial output. Rapid hea rates, especially with atrial fibrillation decreases diastolic .filling time and markedly decreases cardiac output. Li / .filling is optimized by slow hea rate. Hemodynamic goals Low normal hea rate 50-70/min, treat tachycardia aggressively with /8 blockers. Maintain sinus rhythmus if possible. Maintain adequate preload Maintain high normal systemic vascular resistance Avoid hypercarbia, acidosis and hypoxia which may exacerbate pulmonary hypeension. The cardiac output is relatively fixed, maintain adequate afterload, slow the hea rate and avoid hypovolemia. Measure CVP and PAOP and maintain high preload. Avoid rapid decrease in afterload."

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Hemophilia A is a coagulation disorder resulting from a deficiency or abnormality of factor VIII. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic analogue of antidiuretic hormone that increases levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. DDAVP can be used alone for mild hemophilia A, but is ineffective in severe forms of the disease. For severe hemophilia A, DDAVP is given in combination with an inhibitor of fibrinolysis such as eaminocaproic acid (AMICAR). Although FFP contains factor VIII, the levels are too low to prevent or control bleeding in hemophiliacs. Other agents used in treatment of hemophilia A include cryoprecipitate and specific factor VIII concentrates."

      "Administer an erythropoietic agent",
      "Transfuse two units of packed red blood cells"
    ],
    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "Transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells will increase the patient's oxygen delivery the most. Mixed venous oxygen saturation reflects the difference between the oxygen delivered to the tissues and the oxygen taken up by the tissues. Oxygen delivery is the product of cardiac index and oxygen content of blood (CaO2 ), the latter of which is determined primarily by hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) and the paial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) contribute much less. The formula for oxygen content (CaO2 ) can be expressed as CaO2=1.36*Hb*SaO2/100+0.0031*PaO2. Since the patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, increasing his inspired oxygen concentration is unlikely to increase his oxygen delivery. Since the contribution of PaO2 is so low, hyperbaric oxygen is also not the treatment of choice. Fuhermore, transpoing unstable patients to the hyperbaric chamber can be dangerous. Correction of the patient's anemia by the most expeditious manner, that is, transfusion of blood, is the treatment of choice."

However, if the BIS monitor is used primarily to decrease the amount of anesthetic administered for reasons of cost and efficiency, it is possible that an even more frequent incidence of recall might result. Conversely, a recent study on the use of the BIS monitor showed no decrease in the incidence of awareness with the use of volatile anesthetics."

    "explanation": "With pressure control ventilation (PCV), the desired inflation pressure is preselected, and a decelerating inspiratory flow rate provides high flows at the onset of the lung inflation, to attain the desired inflation pressure quickly. Pressure control modes of ventilation In a pressure controlled mode of ventilation, the inspiratory pressure is the control variable, and is maintained during the inspiratory phase. As a result of this, the pressure waveform is \"square\". This increases the mean airway pressure (i.e. the area under the pressure/time graph is greater). During the early inspiratory phase, the ventilator provides a high inspiratory flow rate to rapidly achieve the pressure limit variable (\"PC above PEEP\" on a SERVO-i). In order to maintain this pressure, the flow rate needs to decrease over the course of inspiration, and it generally takes the shape of a downsloping ramp. During the early inspiratory phase, the ventilator provides a high inspiratory flow rate to rapidly achieve the pressure limit variable . In order to maintain this pressure, the flow rate needs to decrease over the course of inspiration, and it generally takes the shape of a downsloping ramp."

Intravenous fluids are similarly classified based on their ability to pass through capillary walls that separates the intravascular and intestinal fluid compament. Crystalloid fluids Crystalloid fluids are electrolyte solutions with small molecules that can diffuse freely from intravascular to interstitial fluid compaments. The principle component of crystalloid fluids is sodium and chloride, which can freely pass through capillary well thus the predominant effect of crystalloid fluids is to expand the interstial volume and not plasma volume.

Effect of different Anaesthetic procedures on hepatic flood flow If an adequate intravascular volume is maintained - Spinal and epidural anaesthesia decrease hepatic blood flow primarily by lowering aerial blood pressure. Where as - General anaesthesia usually decreases it through reduction in blood pressure and cardiac output and sympathetic stimulation. Effect of volatile anaesthetic agents on hepatic blood flow :? All volatile anaesthetic agents reduce poal hepatic blood flow. \"This decrease is greatest with halothane and least with isoflurane\". - Isoflurane appears to be the only volatile agent causing significant direct aerial vasodilation that can increase hepatic aerial blood .flow. - However even with isoflurane total hepatic blood flow decreases because the decrease in poal blood flow usually offsets any increase in hepatic aery. flow."

    "explanation": "(A) Ulnar nerve[Miller's Anaesthesia6-1557,1559,1559f)[?]Neuromuscular function is monitored by evaluating the muscular response to Supramaximal Stimulation of a Peripheral Motor Nerve.Two types of stimulation can be used: 1. Electrical & 2. Magnetic.Electrical nerve stimulation is by far the most commonly used method in clinical practice.[?]Patterns of Nerve Stimulation:For evaluation of neuromuscular function, the most commonly used patterns of electrical nerve stimulation are Single-Twitch, TOF, Tetanic, Post-Tetanic Count (PTC), & Double-Burst Stimulation (DBS).Advantages of Train-of-Four (TOF) stimulation are greatest during nondepolarizing blockade because the degree of block can be read directly from the TOF response even though a preoperative value is lacking.TOF stimulation has some advantages over tetanic stimulation: It is less painful &, unlike tetanic stimulation, doesnot generally affect the degree of neuromuscular blockade.Sites of Nerve Stimulation & Different Muscle Responses:Any superficially located peripheral motor nerve may be stimulated.In clinical anesthesia, the ulnar nerve is the most popular site.Median, posterior tibial, common peroneal, & facial nerves are also sometimes used.For stimulation of the ulnar nerve, the electrodes are best applied to the volar side of the wrist.Distal electrode should be placed about 1 cm proximal to the point at which the proximal flexion crease of the wrist crosses the radial side of the tendon to the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle.Proximal electrode should preferably be placed so that the distance between the centers of the two electrodes is 3 to 6 cm.Electrical stimulation normally elicits only finger flexion & thumb adductionIf one electrode is placed over the ulnar groove at the elbow, thumb adduction is often pronounced because of stimulation of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle.Ulnar groove placement of electrodes (sometimes preferred in small children) is used, the active negative electrode should be at the wrist to ensure maximal response.Polarity of the electrodes is less crucial, placement of the negative electrode distally normally elicits the greatest neuromuscular response.Because different muscle groups have different sensitivities to neuromuscular blocking agents, results obtained for one muscle cannot be automatically extrapolated to other muscles.Diaphragm is among the most resistant of all muscles to both depolarizing and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs.Clinical significance is that onset time is normally shorter for the diaphragm than for the adductor pollicis muscle and the diaphragm recovers from paralysis more quickly than the peripheral muscles do.Other respiratory muscles are less resistant than the diaphragm, as are the larynx & the corrugator supercilii muscles.Most sensitive are the abdominal muscles, the orbicularis oculi muscle, the peripheral muscles of the limbs, & the geniohyoid, masseter, & upper airway muscles.From a practical clinical point of view, it is worth noting that:Response of the corrugator supercilii to facial nerve stimulation reflects the extent of neuromuscular blockade of the laryngeal adductor muscles & abdominal muscles better than the response of the adductor pollicis to ulnar nerve stimulation does.Upper airway muscles seem to be more sensitive than the peripheral muscles.Although three investigations using acceleromyography have indicated small differences in the response to TOF nerve stimulation in the arm (adductor pollicis muscle) & the leg (flexor hallucis brevis muscle), these differences are probably of little clinical significance.Remember: In assessing neuromuscular function, use of a relatively sensitive muscle such as the adductor pollicis of the hand has both disadvantages & advantages.During surgery it is a disadvantage that even total elimination of the response to single-twitch & TOF stimulation does not exclude the possibility of movement of the diaphragm, such as hiccuping & coughing."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "oxygen concentrator They are also known as pressure swing adsorbers. They can be considered as an alternative to a traditional supply where no reliable liquid oxygen supply is available, such as an off-shore site or a site where the safety criteria for liquid installations cannot be met. These devices can be small, designed to supply oxygen to a single patient or they can be large enough to supply oxygen for a medical gas pipeline system. The components of this system are: Duplex compressors and molecular sieves, receivers, dryers, vacuum pumps, filters, line pressure regulators, control system, oxygen performance monitoring system and back up cylinder manifold. Oxygen concentrators operate on the principle of adsorbing (under pressure) other gases in the atmosphere onto the surface of an adsorbent material, known as zeolite. Because oxygen is not adsorbed by the zeolite, it is free to pass through into the storage for use. Zeolite is hydrated aluminium silicates of the alkaline eah metals in a powder or granular form. The zeolite is sealed in a vessel known as sieve bed. The sieve beds operate in pairs, one adsorbs whilst the other regenerates. Ambient air is filtered and pressurised to about 137 kPa by a compressor and then exposed to a zeolite molecular sieve column, forming a very large surface area, at a ceain pressure. The sieve selectively retains nitrogen and other unwanted components of air. These are released into the atmosphere after heating the column and applying a vacuum. The changeover between the columns is made by a time switch. The process is capable of producing oxygen concentrations of about 95%. The remainder is made up of mainly argon with a small percentage of nitrogen. During closed circuit anaesthesia, argon accumulation could occur. Therefore, to avoid this, higher fresh gas flows are required. As the process generates a great deal of heat, hence ventilation and cooling are mandatory. If the plant fails, the emergency cylinder manifold will feed into the pipeline at higher concentrations (99.5%) than the plant's operating norm of 95%. This may have an effect on down line equipment, paicularly in the critical care areas. This low-flow (2-4 L/min), low-pressure system can provide continuous oxygen to the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. A typical unit operates on mains supply and can provide up to 5 L/min of oxygen at a concentration of 94%. It can be piped around the home in small wall mounted outlets ."

Most of the Atracurium and cisatracuriwn is metabolized in this way. - These drugs are so extensively metabolized in this way that their phurmacokinetics is independent of renal and hepatic function. Laudanosine is a breakdown product of the spontaneous non enzymatic organ independent degradation of the drug (Hoffman elimination). -Both Atracurium and cisatracurium undergo Hoffman elimination resulting in laudanosine. - \"Because of its higher potency cisatracurium produces less laudanosine than Atracurium\". Laudanosine may have some potentially toxic systemic effects - It crosses the blood brain barrier and may cause excitement and seizure activity. - In C. VS. high plasma concentration, produces hypotension and bradycardia. -These are probably irrelevant considerations/side effects unless a patient has received an extremely high total dose or has hepatic .failure. - Laudanosine concentration increases in hepatic failure as it is metabolized by the liver."

A Miller laryngoscope with a straight blade is introduced under the epiglottis. It fixes the larynx at the petiole of the epiglottis and lifts the larynx anteriorly to expose the glottis.# Other varieties of laryngoscopes now exist, but the Macintosh and the Miller are the most likely to be found on an emergency cart.# The right hand is used to insert the endotracheal tube, which should not be overly tight in the glottis. In children, an air leak around the tube is desirable.# Slight pressure on the cricoid cartilage by an assistant sometimes helps to visualize the larynx. This maneuver also can help to prevent aspiration of gastric contents by pressing the cricoid cartilage backward against the vertebral column to close the esophagus and help prevent regurgitation. This technique is desirable when a patient has a full stomach.TracheostomyFollowing induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the patient is positioned with a combination of head extension and placement of an appropriate sandbag under the shoulders. There should be no rotation of the head. Children's heads should nor be overextended as it is possible to enter the trachea in the fifth or sixth rings under thesecircumstances.REVIEW OF AIRWAY TECHNIQUES (Temporizing/Adjunctive Measures)# Chin lift/jaw thrust to open airway - caveat: no neck extension if suspected C-spine injury# Bag-valve-mask ventilation - probably the most important, yet under-appreciated, skill of airway management. In the ED, when bagging, use a two-hands on the mask technique for a tight seal, and always use an oral airway# Suctioning/removal of foreign bodies# Nasal airway - generally well-tolerated by the temporarily obtunded patient (e.g. post-ictal, post-procedural sedation, intoxicated)# Oral airway - aids in peri-intubation ventilation; not to be used in patient with intact gag reflex# Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) - this device is inserted into the mouth and has a cuff that occludes the hypopharynx. It has a port through which ventilation can then occur. A variation is the Intubating LMA - this allows the insertion of an endotracheal tube via the ventilation port. The LMA is used both as a rescue device in failed intubation, and as a primary airway device# Needle cricothyroidotomy - accomplished by inserting a needle in cricothyroid membrane, and oxygenating the patient using high pressure oxygen source"

    "explanation": "Infusion of 0.9% normal saline (sodium chloride) will correct his hypovolemia and his metabolic alkalosis. The development of a clinically significant metabolic alkalosis is secondary not only to the loss of acid or addition of alkali but also to renal responses that maintain the alkalosis (paradoxical aciduria). The normal kidney can tremendously augment its excretion of acid or alkali in response to changes in ingested load. However, in the presence of significant volume depletion and consequent excessive salt and water retention, the tubular maximum for bicarbonate reabsorption is increased. Correction of volume depletion alone is usually sufficient to correct the alkalosis, since the kidney will then excrete the excess bicarbonate. HCl infusion is usually unnecessary. Acetazolamide can be utilized to increase renal excretion of bicarbonate but should be avoided in volume-depleted individuals. Moreover, to the extent that acetazolamide causes natriuresis, it will exacerbate the volume depletion."

Explanation The addition of sodium bicarbonate to local anesthetics improves the speed of onset, reduces the minimum concentration of the local anesthetic required and improves the quality of block. Adding sodium bicarbonate increases the pH of the local anesthetic solution, and thus more amount of free uncharged drug is available which can increase the rate of diffusion across the nerve sheath and improve the onset of anesthesia. Subcutaneous injections of local anesthetics are painful. Alkalinization of the solution by adding sodium bicarbonate before injecting can decrease the pain. Addition of adrenaline or any vasoconstriction causes decrease in systemic toxicity."

    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Dopamine has a variety of pharmacologic characteristics that make it useful in critically ill patients. At all doses, the diastolic blood pressure can be expected to rise; since coronary perfusion is largely a result of the head of pressure at the coronary ostia, coronary blood flow should be increased. In low doses (1-5 mg/), dopamine affects primarily the dopaminergic receptors. Activation of these receptors causes vasodilation of the renal and mesenteric vasculature and mild vasoconstriction of the peripheral bed, which thereby redirects blood flow to kidneys and bowel. At these low doses, the net effect on the overall vascular resistance may be slight. As the dose rises (2-10 mg/), b1 -receptor activity predominates and the inotropic effect on the myocardium leads to increased cardiac output and blood pressure. Above 10 mg/(kg*min), a-receptor stimulation causes peripheral vasoconstriction, shifting of blood from extremities to organs, decreased kidney function, and hypeension."

      "Hypeension"
    ],
    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Opioids can increase muscle tone and may cause muscle rigidity. The incidence of rigidity noted with opioid anesthetic techniques varies significantly because of differences in dose and speed of opioid administration, the concomitant use of N2O, the presence or absence of muscle relaxants, and the patient's age. Opioid-induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone that sometimes progresses to severe stiffness with the potential for serious problems. Clinically significant opioid-induced rigidity usually begins just as or after a patient loses consciousness. Mild manifestations of rigidity, such as hoarseness, can occur in conscious patients. Vocal cord closure is primarily responsible for the difficult ventilation with a bag and mask that follows the administration of opioids. The precise mechanism by which opioids cause muscle rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not the result of a direct action on muscle fibers because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. Mechanisms of opioid-induced muscle rigidity involving the CNS have been postulated. Pharmacologic investigation using selective agonists and antagonists suggest that systemic opioid-induced muscle rigidity is primarily caused by activation of central m receptors, whereas supraspinal d1 and k1 receptors may attenuate this effect. Some aspects of opioid-induced catatonia and rigidity (increased incidence with age, muscle movements resembling extrapyramidal side effects) are similar to Parkinson's disease and suggest similarities in neurochemical mechanisms. Patients with Parkinson's disease, paicularly if they are inadequately treated, may experience reactions such as dystonia following opioid administration. Pretreatment with or concomitant use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can decrease the incidence and severity of rigidity. Induction doses of sodium thiopental and subanesthetic doses of diazepam and midazolam can prevent, attenuate, or successfully treat rigidity. Rapid administration of larger doses of opioids (paicularly fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, and alfentanil) can induce chest wall rigidity severe enough to make ventilation with bag and mask nearly impossible.

Rebreathing of carbon dioxide is prevented by an adequate fresh gas flow and by the presence of adjustable pressure release valve. The exhaled carbon dioxide flows through the outer corrugated tube and out this valve from where it can be scavenged. The fresh gas flows through the inner tube. When anesthetic gas inflow is much greater than the uptake by the patient and the circuit, excess pressure builds up, which leads to the opening of the adjustable pressure valve and expelling out of the gases.

Sevoflurane is used in N2O+O2 gas mixture. Halothane is second choice inhalational agent for induction. Isoflurane and desflurane are not used for induction as they are more pungent and associated with more coughing 8c laryngospasm.Intravenous induction* Intravenous induction is preferred when induction by mask is contraindicated i.e., in full stomach patients or of child comes in the operation theatre with IV line in situ.* Thiopentol or propofol are commonly used agents. Propofol is particularly suitable for out patient surgery. Ketamine is preferred in children with hypovolemia. Etomidate can be used in child with unstable cardiovascular status as it is most cardio-vascular stable intravenous inducing agent.Maintenance* As sevoflurane cause emergence delirium and agitation, it is not used for maintenance. After induction with sevoflurane anaesthesia, isoflurane or Halothane are used for maintenance anaesthesia. During maintenance, anaesthetic gas mixture contain N2O+O2 +Halothane or isoflurane. Halothane is commonly used for induction and maintenance in children.* If sevoflurane is continued for maintenance, administration of an opioid (Fentanyl) 15-20 min before the end of the procedure can reduce the incidence of emergence delirium and agitation.Muscle relaxantsDepolarizing blockers* Children are more susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia, Hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis after administration of succinylcholine. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following administration of sucinylcholine, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. For this reason, succinylcholine is best avoided for routine elective surgery in children.* Generally accepted indications for succinylcholine are1) Rapid sequence induction, 2) Laryngospasm, and 3) Rapid muscle relaxation prior to intravenous access (e.g., regurgitation).* Profound bradycardia and sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following first dose of succinyl choline, if given without pretreatment with atropine. Therefore, atropine must always be administered prior to succinylcholine in children.* Children with muscular dystrophy are more prone to develop hyperkalemia: Arrhythmia and cardiac arrest may occur - Should be avoided in such patients.Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants* Functional maturation of NM junction is not complete unti 12 months of age, therefore new born sarevery sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.* Kidney and liver functions are immature in neonate - Atracurium/cisatracurium is the muscle relaxant of choice in newborn as it does not require renal or hepatic elimination. For the same reason mivacurium can also be used.* In older children the choice of non-depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on the side effects, and onset & duration of action: -i) Mivacurium for procedures lasting 10-15 min.ii) Atracurium/cisatracurium for precedures lasting around 30 min.iii) Pancuronium when tachycardia is desired e.g., with fentanyliv) Vecuronium (fastest acting non-depolarizing NM blocker) for intubation in place of SCH.v) Atracurium/cisatracurium in patients with renal or hepatic disease."

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Early enteral nutrition is recommended in patients predicted to have a prolonged recovery after surgery. The misconception that the entire bowel does not function in the early postoperative period is still widely held. Intestinal motility and absorption studies have clarified the patterns by which bowel activity resumes. The stomach remains uncoordinated in its muscular activity and does not empty efficiently for about 24 hours after abdominal procedures. The small bowel functions normally within hours of surgery and is able to accept nutrients promptly, either by nasoduodenal or percutaneous jejunal feeding catheters or, after 24 hours, by gastric emptying. The colon is stimulated in large measure by the gastrocolic reflex but ordinarily is relatively inactive for 3 to 4 days. Well-nourished patients who undergo uncomplicated surgical procedures can tolerate up to 10 days without full nutritional suppo before significant problems with protein breakdown begin to occur. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition because of decreased risks of nosocomial infections and catheter-related complications and increased benefit in preventing mucosal atrophy"

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Phase 2 blockade produced succinylcholine Patients developing paralysis after prolonged and high dose of succinyl choline is highly suggestive of phase II succinyl choline block.Phase II block with succinylcholine occurs with prolonged and high dose of the drug.(High dose for Sch is 7-10 mg/kg, 30-60 minutes of exposure is considered prolong).Morgan's Anaesthesia 4th/e p. 112The type of succinylcholine block may change into a non depolarizing block following prolonged administration of the drug (phase II block). Transition from a depolarizing to phase II block is gradual and usually occurs after administration of 7-10 mg/kg of succinylcholine. Recovery from a phase II block is much slower.Millers Anaesthesia 6th/e p. 985After administration of 7-10 mg/kg or 30-60 minutes of exposure to succinylcholine, non depolarizing dual or phase II block occursProlonged paralysis with succinylcholine administration may also occur in pseudocholinesterase deficiencyBut in pseudocholinesterase deficiency prolonged paralysis occurs with usual dose of succinylcholine.Succinylcholine is a noncompetitive muscle relaxantNormally muscles contract due to the action of acetylcholine released in the neuromuscular synaptic junctionsAcetylcholine acts by activating its receptors present on motor end plate, and generates action potentialCompetitive Neuromuscular blockers act by blocking the action of acetylcholine and prevents the generation of action potential.On the other hand succinylcholine acts by depolarization of the motor end plate i.e. it activates the acetylcholine receptor present at the motor end plate.At their first application voluntary muscle contracts but as they are not destroyed immediately like acetylcholine the depolarization persist. It might be expected that this prolonged depolarization would cause muscles to remain contracted but this is not so.With prolonged administration, a depolarization block changes to competitive block. Succinylcholine produces neuromuscular block by overstimulation so that the end plate is unable to respond to further stimulation.Neuromuscular block with succinylcholine occurs in two sequential phasesAn initial depolarization of the endplate produces muscle action potentials and fasciculations.Maintained depolarization past the threshold for firing produces Na+ channel inactivation so that muscle action potentials cannot be generated.This is called phase I or depolarization blockIn the continued presence of succinylcholine, the membrane becomes repolarized *Na+ channel inactivation is reversed and muscle membrane excitability is restoredNonetheless, the neuromuscular block persists because of desensitization of Acetylcholine receptorsThis is known as phase II or desensitization blockThe mechanism for phase II block is not completely understood, a series of allosteric transitions in Acetylcholine receptor is suspected.Succinylcholine phase I block changes to phase II block after prolonged administration of the drue usually following 7-10 mg/kg of the drug or 700 mg drug.Pseudocholinesterase deficiencySuccinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine which is pharmacologically inactive.In certain conditions metabolism of succinylcholine to the metabolically inactive succinylmonocholine cannot occur.These are : -Genetic determined inability to metabolize succinylcholineSmall proportion of patients have genetically determined inability to metabolize succinylcholine.In these patients either the plasma cholinesterase is absent or there is an abnormal form of the enzyme presentThe metabolism of succinylcholine is reduced and the patient have prolonged paralysis.An important point to note is that this prolonged paralysis occurs even with usual doses of succinylcholine.Other endogenous and exogenous causesPlasma cholinesterase activity can be reduced by a number of endogenous and exogenous causes such as : -PregnancyLiver diseaseUremiaMalnutritionBurnsPlasma pheresisOral contraceptivesThese conditions usually lead to a slight clinically unimportant increase in the duration of action of succinylcholine."

The hemodynamic stability seen with etomidate is caused by its lack of effect on the sympathetic nervous system and on the function of the baroreceptor. In multiple studies, etomidate has been used for induction in patients with a compromised cardiovascular system who are undergoing coronary aery bypass surgery or valve surgery, as well as in patients requiring induction of general anesthesia for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, aoic aneurysm repair, and thoracic surgery. For cardioversion, the rapid onset, quick recovery, and maintenance of aerial blood pressure in these sometimes hemodynamically tenuous patients, combined with continued spontaneous respiration, make etomidate an acceptable choice.

However, when airway complications did occur within the ICU, they were more likely to be associated with a much higher incidence of death or severe disability (61%), when compared to the anesthesia or emergency depament. Capnography is paramount for monitoring anyone with an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy. It may prevent significant harm by indicating oesophageal intubation or displacement of tracheostomy or endotracheal tube and is recommended by the Royal College of Anaesthetists as a standard of care in the UK. Regular audit and education are impoant to improve staff awareness and patient care when dealing with any intubated/tracheostomised patient. All staff undeaking any routine movement/turns or transfer of intubated patients, need to be ale to the potential risk of airway displacement and have an established management plan if this were to occur.Reference: RCOA/DAS. 4th National Audit Project, 2011.

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "It is impoant to identify and treat occult or early sepsis before it progresses to septic shock and the associated complications of multiple organ failure. An immunocompromised host may not manifest some of the more typical signs and symptoms of infection, such as elevated temperature and white cell count; this forces the clinician to focus on more subtle signs and symptoms. Early sepsis is a physiologically hyperdynamic, hypermetabolic state representing a surge of catecholamines, coisol, and other stress-related hormones. Changing mental status, tachypnea that leads to respiratory alkalosis, and flushed skin are often the earliest manifestations of sepsis. Intermittent hypotension requiring increased fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate urine output is characteristic of occult sepsis. Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance during sepsis are typical in diabetic as well as nondiabetic patients. This relates to the gluconeogenic state of the stress response. The cardiovascular response to early sepsis is characterized by an increased cardiac output, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and decreased peripheral utilization of oxygen, which yields a decreased aeriovenous oxygen difference."

It contains preganglionic sympathetic fibers from greater and lesser splanchnic nerves (emerge from the thoracic sympathetic ganglia, T5 to T12) as well as postganglionic sympathetic and preganglionic parasympathetic fibers. It provides sensory innervation and sympathetic outflow to stomach, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney and GI tract up to splenic flexure. Plexus is located at the level of T12-L2 (usually L1) and lies anterior to aoa in the retroperitoneal space. Indications Most common indication is treatment of pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Occasionally used in the treatment of pain from chronic pancreatitis (controversial). Can be used for pain from other GI malignancies from LES to splenic flexure, as well as liver, spleen and kidneys. Complications Ohostatic hypotension (most common, can be minimized with fluid hydration) and diarrhea (secondary to blockade of sympathetic fibers).

Pressure does not always decrease in the direction of flow - if one assumes friction is negligible (and thus the total energy of the system remains constant), any change in the kinetic energy of a fluid (ex. a reduction as U^2 falls) must be accompanied by an oppositional change in potential energy increases(P rises) Whether flow is laminar or turbulent is dependent on the Reynolds Number (Re), defined as: Re = rUL/u Where r is density, U is equal to fluid velocity, L is the length of the tubing, and u is the viscosity of the fluid. Note that the modified Bernoulli Equation applies to laminar flow (ReD < 2300, parabolic flow profile), but not to turbulent flow (ReD > 4000, blunted flow profile) Flowmeters based on a Venturi tube (circular tube with a gradual contraction and expansion in diameter, ex. those used in aircraft) maintain laminar flow at normal flow rates - since conservation of mass and energy is assumed to apply, restriction of the diameter leads to increased speed of gas flow and a corresponding decrease in the pressure on the walls The floating bobbin rotameter that is familiar to anesthesiologists is known as the Thorpe tube - the sudden restriction caused by the bobbin leads to a propoional increase in velocity and the Bernoulli equation does not apply (flow is propoionate to the square root of the pressure drop). Because the pressure drop across the orifice is inversely propoional to orifice area squared, the pressure change across the bobbin will decrease as the bobbin rises (and the area of the tube increases). The bobbin reaches a steady state when the pressure drop exactly opposes the gravitational force on the bobbin - at this steady state the pressure drop is always the same (because gravitational forces are constant), however as flow rates increase, the bobbin will move higher because this critical pressure drop will occur over a larger cross-sectional area (since velocity is higher)"

    "question": "An elderly diabetic woman with chronic steroid-dependent bronchospasm has an ileocolectomy for a perforated cecum. She is taken to the ICU intubated and is maintained on broad-spectrum antibiotics, renal dose dopamine, and a rapid steroid taper.

    "explanation": "Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur in patients with severe stress, infection, or trauma or as a result of abrupt cessation or too rapid tapering of chronic glucocoicoid therapy, and is classically manifested as changing mental status, increased temperature, cardiovascular collapse, hypoglycemia, and hyperkalemia. The diagnosis can be difficult to make and requires a high index of suspicion. Its clinical presentation is similar to that of sepsis; however, sepsis is generally associated with hyperglycemia and no significant change in potassium. The treatment for adrenal crisis is intravenous steroids, volume resuscitation, and other suppoive measures to treat any new or ongoing stress. Dexamethasone should be used as steroid replacement when additional testing with an adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is planned, since hydrocoisone can interfere with measurement of coisol levels. Steroid treatment can be subsequently conveed to oral medication and tapered after treatment of the adrenal crisis"

Since nitrous oxide diffuses into gas-filled compaments faster than nitrogen can diffuse out, its use can lead to worsened distention, which may be undesirable (eg, in an operation for intestinal obstruction)."

Note also that the rapid uptake of N2O into blood results in an effective increase in minute ventilation, because more circuit gas is passively drawn into alveoli as alveolar gas is absorbed rapidly. These effects have been demonstrated in humans and animals, and theoretically, are sho-lived and peain only to the period of initial rapid transfer of N2O from alveoli to blood.

In these cases emergency airway management is essential. The patient require immediate oxygen. - These patients needs to be intubated immediately. - But an impoant point to note is that severe maxillofacial trauma makes intubation very difficult. -Some believe that nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in patients with severe maxillofacial injury because nasotracheal intubation in these patients can result in nasocranial intubation or severe nasal hemorrhage. - Nasotracheal intubation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with midfacial injury and C.S.F. rhinorrhoea. Orotracheal intubation in patients with severe maxillofacial injury In patients with severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation is also difficult. Presence of blood clots, .fractures make the passage of the tube quite difficult. Moreover when the surgeons perform operation for mandibular or maxillary fractures they wires both these together. If surgery is required with severe maxillofacial injury surgeons usually prefer nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Tracheostomy in patient with severe maxillofacial injury : ? Tracheostomy does not have much role in \"emergency airways management\". - Tracheostomy is a time taking procedure compared to intubation. - If the airways of the patient is severely compromised and he requires immediate oxygenation, tracheostomy has no role. - Immediate oxygenation can only be delivered by rapid intubation. In case, intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. -In emergency management of the airway, cricothyroidotomy is done if intubation is not possible. Tracheostomy is only done when immediate oxygen requirements are taken care of and a surgical procedure is planned. In the question the Sp02 of the patient is 80% when on oxygen. He requires immediate emergency management of the airway which can be achieved through intubation, If intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative.

    ],
    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "In Mendelson's syndrome, the critical pH is 2.5 and the critical volume is 25ml (0.3ml/kg body wt). Opioids will decrease the tone of LES and increase the risk rather than decrease. In 1946, Mendelson was the first to describe aspiration pneumonitis attributable to the pulmonary aspiration of acidic gastric secretions in pregnant women undergoing anesthesia. This potentially fatal complication, occasionally referred to as Mendelson syndrome, has since been the intense focus of preventive effos among the anesthesia community. Prevention of aspiration of gastric contents is primarily accomplished by adherence to established preoperative fasting guidelines, premedication with drugs that may decrease the risk of aspiration pneumonitis, and specialized induction techniques. Traditionally, patients who were scheduled for elective procedures requiring sedation, regional anesthesia, or general anesthesia were instructed to remain NPO (Latin for nulla per os or nothing by mouth) after midnight to ensure an empty stomach to decrease the risk of regurgitation. Based on evidence that allowing ingestion of clear liquids 2 to 4 hours before surgery resulted in lower gastric volumes and higher gastric pH, the ASA published Practice Guidelines for Preoperative Fasting and the Use of Pharmacologic Agents to Reduce the Risk of Pulmonary Aspiration in 1999 that liberalized the traditional NPO policy and allowed clear liquids up to 2 hours before beginning elective procedures requiring anesthesia. The guidelines, updated in 2011, recommend 4 hours of fasting from breast milk 6 hours of fasting from solid foods, infant formula, and nonhuman milk. Fried or fatty foods may require longer fasting times (e.g., 8 hours or more). Although the ASA guidelines do not specifically address chewing gum, hard candies, or smoking, guidelines published by the European Society of Anaesthesiology on the topic do not recommend delaying the sta of anesthesia if a patient has consumed any of these immediately before the induction of anesthesia. The routine use of drugs as prophylaxis against aspiration pneumonitis is not recommended by the ASA guidelines but may be beneficial in patients with specific risk factors for aspiration, such as a full stomach, symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hiatal hernia, presence of a nasogastric tube, morbid obesity, diabetic gastroparesis, or pregnancy. The goal of aspiration prophylaxis is twofold: to decrease gastric volume and to increase gastric fluid pH. Commonly used agents include nonpaiculate antacids (e.g., Bicitra), promotility drugs (e.g., metoclopramide), and H2-receptor antagonists. These drugs may be used alone or in combination.

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Sevoflurane's solubility in blood is slightly greater than desflurane (lb/g 0.65 versus 0.42). Nonpungency and rapid increases in alveolar anesthetic concentration make sevoflurane an excellent choice for smooth and rapid inhalation inductions in pediatric and adult patients. In fact, inhalation induction with 4% to 8% sevoflurane in a 50% mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen can be achieved within 1 min. Likewise, its low blood solubility results in a rapid fall in alveolar anesthetic concentration upon discontinuation and a more rapid emergence compared with isoflurane. Similar to isoflurane and desflurane, sevoflurane causes slight increases in CBF and intracranial pressure at normocarbia, although some studies show a decrease in CBF. High concentrations of sevoflurane (>1.5 MAC) may impair the autoregulation of CBF, thus allowing a drop in CBF during hemorrhagic hypotension. This effect on CBF autoregulation seems to be less pronounced than with isoflurane. Cerebral metabolic oxygen requirements decrease, and seizure activity has not been repoed. Propofol and thiopentone are cerebroprotective as they reduce ICP and CMRO2. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e"

If attempts at maternal resuscitation fail, consider immediate cesarean section. Gestational age greater than 23 weeks is the recommended cut-off for immediate delivery. A fetus younger than 23 weeks has an extremely poor prognosis. Such instances of perimoem delivery are rare, and the chances of fetal survival are generally poor. The earlier the fetus is delivered following maternal arrest the better is the fetal survival. Delivery should be conducted in the mother's current location; transpoation to an operating room wastes valuable time. Cesarean section should be performed no later than 4 minutes after initial maternal arrest. A fetus delivered within 5 min from initiation of CPR has the best chance for survival. Deliveries occurring more than 5 min after cardiopulmonary arrest are unlikely to result in a normal ble infant. Resuscitative effos should continue during preparation for, and throughout, delivery of the fetus. Delivery of the fetus sometimes results in maternal recovery due to release of vena caval compression and improved cardiac return."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Catheter ablation provides a definitive management option for SVT and is usually done under local anaesthesia as a day case. Catheters capable of recording electrical activation in the hea are inseed the femoral vessels and manipulated under x ray guidance. Radiofrequency energy delivered a catheter is used to create small localised areas of scar. In AVN, the slow pathway is targeted with the aim of modifying conduction so that re-entrant tachycardia can no longer be sustained. Both acute and long term success rates for this procedure are high. AV is also amenable to catheter ablation. Focal atrial tachycardia can also be successfully treated with catheter ablation For re-entrant atrial tachycardias, radiofrequency ablation has high success rates and is often used as first line treatment Radiofrequency ablation is the treatment of choice for typical atrial flutter.

Complications of epidural opioids even at these reduced doses still include nausea and vomiting (30-40%), sedation, respiratory depression (1%), as with parenteral routes, but to these can be added pruritus (10-50%) and urinary retention (5-40%). Pruritus is not due to histamine release but may respond to antihistamines; it will always respond to a small dose of naloxone without reducing analgesia. motor block , autonomic block not seen with epidural opioid"

In this mode, VT and ventilatory rate are fixed (minute ventilation) regardless of patient effo, because patient can not breathe spontaneously. So this mode will pay no role in weaning a patient from mechanical ventilation, setling to limit inspiratory pressure guard against pulmonary barotraumaQ. In Assist control ventilation (ACV) by incorporating a pressure sensor in breathing circuit, the patients inspiratory effo can be used to trigger inspiration. The ventilator can be set for a fixed ventilatory rate, but each patient effo of sufficient magnitude will trigger the set VT (tidal volume). And if the spontaneous inspiratory effos are not detected the machine functions as if in the control mode.

The mainstay treatment for succinylcholine apnea due to atypical pseudocholinesterase is to continue mechanical ventilation until muscle function returns to normal by clinical signs. Administration of neostigmine is controversial as the effects may be transient, possibly followed by intensified neuromuscular blockade. Fresh frozen plasma can augment the patient's endogenous plasma pseudocholinesterase activity but is not recommended because of the risk of iatrogenic viral infectious complications. If human plasma cholinesterase is available, it can be given to reverse neuromuscular blockade. Hence, the best option here would be to continue mechanical ventilation."

Though Sevoflurane, methoxyflurane, and halothane also degrade in the presence of strong bases, they do not produce CO. CO production is predominantly seen with absorbents that contain barium hydroxide and when the water content of soda lime or Baralyme falls below 1.4% and 5%. Amsorb is a CO2 absorbent which is more ine than soda lime and baralyme and so associated with lesser degradation of anesthetics and so less carbon monoxide production."

Consequently its duration of action is not altered in patients with hepatic/renal insufficiency or hypodynamic circulation. It is the preferred muscle relaxant for such patients as well as for neonates and the elderly. Hypotension may occur due to histamine release.Cisatracurium, R-Cis, R-Cis enantiomer of atracurium is nearly 4 times more potent, slower in onset, but similar in duration of action. Like atracurium it undergoes Hofmann elimination, but in contrast it is not hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase. Most importantly, it does not provoke histamine release.ATRACURIUM BESYLATE# Long acting and non-depolarising muscle relaxant.# Muscle relaxant of choice in renal failure or anephric patients.# pH of solution is 3.5.; Stored at 4degC.; Duration of action doubled at 25degC.# Metabolism mainly by Hofmann elimination (chemical degradation) and hydrolysis in plasma and elsewhere in body.# Major metabolite is laudanosine, which is CNS stimulant.# Cisatracurium is one of the ten isomers of atracurium and its active metabolites contain less laudanosine which causeless hypotension, central nervous system excitement, and seizures than that of atracurium.# It is considered an intermediate-acting agent in terms of duration of action.Notable features of Few muscle relaxantsPropertyMuscle relaxant (MR)Rapid onset of ActionShortest ActingLongest ActingSch (overall); Rocuronium (non-depolarising)Sch (overall); Mivacurium (non-depolarising)DoxacuriumExcreted in LiverRocuronium; VecuroniumNo placenta crossingd -TCHistamine released-TC (maximum) Atracuronium Mivacuronium SchLeast Histamine releaseVecuroniumMost CardiostableVecuroniumM.R. used to decrease BPd -TCM.R.

Order of recovery is in reverse order.o Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure,o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all.o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated,o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres."

    "explanation": "Meyer-Oveon correlation of anesthetic potency with solubility in olive oil interpreted by the majority of researchers as an indicator that lipids are likely the anesthetic target. This interpretation focused attention on anesthetic effects on the bulk physical propeies of cell membranes, which were known at that time to consist primarily of lipid molecules. Such nonspecific or \"lipoid-based\" anesthetic theories dominated the field from the 1960s to the 1980s. Moreover, the simple elegance of the relationship between MAC and lipid solubility graphically illustrated Meyer and Oveon's conclusion that \"All chemically indifferent substances that are soluble in fat are anesthetics ... their relative potency as anesthetics will depend on their affinity to fat on the one hand and water on the other hand, that is, on the fat/water paition coefficient. This was interpreted as oring lipids as the primary targets of anesthetics and a single nonspecific theory to explain anesthesia. Objections to the outdated lipid hypotheses: 1. Stereoisomers of an anesthetic drug Stereoisomers that represent mirror images of each other are termed enantiomers or optical isomers (for example, the isomers of R-(+)- and S-(-)-etomidate). Physicochemical effects of enantiomers are always identical in an achiral environment (for example in the lipid bilayer). However, in vivo enantiomers of many general anesthetics (e.g. isoflurane, thiopental, etomidate) can differ greatly in their anesthetic potency despite the similar oil/gas paition coefficients. For example, the R-(+) isomer of etomidate is 10 times more potent anesthetic than its S-(-) isomer 2. Non-immobilizers According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, the anesthetic potency of the drug is directly propoional to its lipid solubility, however, there are many compounds that do not satisfy this rule. These drugs are strikingly similar to potent general anesthetics and are predicted to be potent anesthetics based on their lipid solubility, but they exe only one constituent of the anesthetic action (amnesia) and do not suppress movement (i.e. do not depress spinal cord functions) as all anesthetics do. These drugs are referred to as non-immobilizers. 3. Temperature increases do not have an anaesthetic effect 4. Effect vanishes beyond a ceain chain length According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, in a homologous series of any general anesthetic (e.g. n-alcohols, or alkanes), increasing the chain length increases the lipid solubility, and thereby should produce a corresponding increase in anesthetic potency. However, beyond a ceain chain length, the anesthetic effect disappears. For the n-alcohols, this cutoff occurs at a carbon chain length of about 13 and for the n-alkanes at a chain length of between 6 and 10, depending on the species. 5. Non-hydrophobic anesthetics.

Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) can be used to trace the signal generated by a sound through the ascending auditory pathway. The evoked potential is generated in the cochlea, goes through the cochlear nerve, through the cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, lateral lemniscus, to the inferior colliculus in the midbrain, on to the medial geniculate body, and finally to the coex. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials are small AEPs that are recorded in response to an auditory stimulus from electrodes placed on the scalp. AEPs serve for assessment of the functioning of the auditory system and neuroplasticity. They can be used to diagnose learning disabilities in children, aiding in the development of tailored educational programs for those with hearing and or cognition problems."

In these models, adipose tissue uptake and metabolic clearance (elimination) play only minor roles in the termination of the effects of the induction dose.

Paul's anaesthesia 5th/pg. 427-428; Miller 7th/pg. 867)Paul's anaesthesia 5th/pg. 427-428 ..............'The mean dose of scoline producing 95% blockade (ED95) at the adductor pollicis is 0.30 to 0.35 mg/kg with opioid- nitrous oxide anesthesia. In the absence of nitrous oxide, the ED95 is increased to 0.5 mg/kg\".DEPOLARIZING DRUGS: SUCCINYLCHOLINENeuromuscular Effects# depolarizes presynaptic, postsynaptic, and extrajunctional receptors.# Within 1 minute after succinylcholine injection and before paralysis is manifest, some disorganized muscular activity is observed frequently (\"fasciculations\") and is probably a result of depolarization of the nerve terminal produced by activation of presynaptic receptors.# In some muscles, like the masseter and to a lesser extent the adductor pollicis, a sustained increase in tension that may last for several minutes can be observed (spasm).Characteristics of Depolarizing Blockade# After injection of succinylcholine, single-twitch height is decreased. However, the response to high-frequency stimulation is sustained: minimal train-of-four and tetanic fade is observed. The block is antagonized by nondepolarizing agents so that the ED95 is increased by a factor two if a small dose of nondepolarizing drug is given before.# Succinylcholine blockade is potentiated by inhibitors of acetyl cholinesterase, such as neostigmine and edrophonium.# Phase II Block: After administration of 7 to 10 mg/kg, or 30 to 60 minutes of exposure to succinylcholine, train- of-four and tetanic fade become apparent. Neostigmine or edrophonium can antagonize this block, which has been termed \"nondepolarizing,\" \"dual,\" or \"Phase II block.\" The onset of Phase II block coincides with tachyphylaxis, as more succinylcholine is required for the same effect.Pharmacology of Succinylcholine# Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase (also called pseudocholinesterase), with an elimination half-life of <1 minute in patients. Because of the rapid disappearance of succinylcholine from plasma, the maximum effect is reached quickly.# Plasma cholinesterase activity is reduced by some anticholinesterases (e.g., neostigmine) so that the duration of succinylcholine given after neostigmine, but not after edrophonium, is increased.Side Effects# Sinus bradycardia with nodal or ventricular escape beats.- Anaphylaxis# Fasciculations- Muscle Pains# increases intragastric pressure- Hyperkalemia# increases intraocular Pressure & ICP Clinical Uses# to facilitate tracheal intubation (adult dose of 1.0 mg/kg; Children are slightly more resistant to succinylcholine than adults, and doses of 1 to 2 mg/kg are required to facilitate intubation. In infants, 2 to 3 mg/kg may be required. Precurarization is not necessary in patients younger than 10 years).# \"rapid sequence induction\" ( patient with full stomach and possibility of aspiration).# Succinylcholine, at a dose of 4 mg/kg, is the only effective intramuscular neuromuscular blocking agent in children with difficult intravenous access and provides adequate intubating conditions in about 4 minutes. However, this route of administration should not be the method of choice.Additional Educational points:Sevoflurane:# Fast induction and emergence# Rapid changes in depth can be achieved.# Acceptability is good by pediatric patients (agent of choice for induction in children).# Hepatic blood flow is maintained.# Does not cause sympathetic stimulation and airway irritation even during rapid induction.# Amount of fluoride liberated is safe for kidney and liver.# Degraded by sodalime - hence not recommended for use in closed circuit."

Respiration is not depressed, airway reflexes are maintained, muscle tone increases; limb movements occur and eyes may remain open.# Heart rate, cardiac output and BP are elevated due to sympathetic stimulation. A dose of average 1.5 mg/kg i.v. or 5 mg/ kg i.m. produces the above effects within a minute, and recovery starts after 10-15 min, but patient remains amnesic for 1-2 hr.# Children tole rate ketamine better. Ketamine is metabolized in the liver and has an elimination 11/2 of 3-4 hr.# Ketamine has been used for operations in head and neck, in patients who have bleeding, asthmatics (relieves broncho- spasm), in those who do not want to lose consciousness and in short operations. It is good for repeated use, particularly suitable for bum dressing. Combined with diazepam, it has found to beuseful in angiographies, cardiac catheterization, and trauma surgery.# It may be dangerous in hypertensives, in ischaemic heart disease and those with raised intracranial pressure (increases cerebral blood flow), but is good for hypovolemic patients."

H2O freely travels outside the vasculature, so as little as 10% of isotonic fluid remains in the intravascular space. Both 0.9% saline and RL are equally effective;# Colloid solutions (eg, hydroxyethyl starch, albumin, dextrans) are also effective for volume replacement during major hemorrhage. Colloid solutions offer no major advantage over crystalloid solutions, and albumin has been associated with poorer outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury.B) Nonhemorrhagic hypovolemia# Isotonic crystalloid solutions are typically given for intravascular repletion during shock and hypovolemia.

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Ref: Miller Textbook of Anaesthesia. 6th editionExplanation:Mechanism of action of Local anestheticsThe primary mechanism of action of local anesthetics is blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels.The excitable membrane of nerve axons, like the membrane ot cardiac muscle and neuronal cell bodies, maintains a resting transmembrane potential of -90 to -60 mV.During excitation, the sodium channels open, and a fast inward sodium current quickly depolarizes the membrane toward the sodium equilibrium potential t+40 mV).As a result of depolarization, the sodium channels close (inactivate) and potassium channels open. The outward flow of potassium repolarizes the membrane toward the potassium equilibrium potential (about -95 mV): repolarization returns the sodium channels to the rested state.Biologic toxins such as batrachotoxin. aconitine, veratridine. and some scorpion venoms bind to receptors within the channel and prevent inactivation. This results in prolonged influx of sodium through the channel and depolarization of the resting potential.The marine toxins tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin block sodium channels by binding to channel receptors near the extracellular surface. Their clinical effects superficially resemble those of local anesthetics (ie, block of conduction without a change in the resting potential) even though their receptor site is quite different.The blockade of sodium channels by most local anesthetics is both voltage- and time-dependent: Channels in the rested state, which predominate at more negative membrane potentials, have a much lower affinity for local anesthetics than activated (open state) and inactivated channels, w-hich predominate at more positive membrane potentials.Elevated extracellular calcium partially antagonizes the action of local anesthetics owing to the calcium-induced increase in the surface potential on the membrane (which favors the low-affinity rested state).Increases in extracellular potassium depolarize the membrane potential and favor the inactivated state, enhancing the effect of local anesthetics."

    "explanation": "Heparin is reversed by the administration of protamine sulfate. Spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage is a rare but potentially fatal complication of anticoagulation. Heparin is much more frequently associated with spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage than are oral agents. Advanced patient age and poor regulation of coagulation times also increase the likelihood of bleeding complications. Most cases of retroperitoneal hemorrhage present with flank pain and signs of peritoneal irritation suggestive of an acute intra-abdominal process. CT scans are most useful in confirming the diagnosis and following the course of the bleeding. Successful management is usually nonoperative and consists of the discontinuation of anticoagulants, reversal of anticoagulation, possible transfusion of clotting factors, and repletion of intravascular volume with intravenous fluids. Warfarin inhibits synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, whereas heparin potentiates antithrombin III activity. Aprotinin is a protease inhibitor that decreases the inflammatory and fibrinolytic response and is used in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery to reduce bleeding complications. Lepirudin is an anticoagulant that is used in patients who develop heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Thrombin can be used topically as a hemostatic agent."

    "explanation": "MH is a pharmacogenetic clinical syndrome that, in its classic form occurs during anesthesia with a volatile halogenated alkane such as halothane and/or the administration of the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine.The fulminant MH episode observed clinically produces rapidly increasing body temperature (by as much as 1deg C in 5 minutes) and extreme acidosis as a result of an acute loss of control of intracellular calcium levels and compensatory uncontrolled increases in skeletal muscle metabolism that may proceed to severe rhabdomyolysis. Although MH was initially associated with a moality rate of 60%, earlier diagnosis and the use of dantrolene have reduced the moality to less than 1.4%. Current cases of MH are restricted in severity because of diagnostic awareness, early detection through end-expired carbon dioxide (CO2), the use of less potent anesthetic triggers, and the administration of drugs that attenuate the progression of the fulminant episode. The incidence of fulminant MH was repoed to be 1 case per 62,000 anesthetics administered when triggering agents were not used, but the number of suspected cases was 1 case per 4500 anesthetics administered when triggering agents were administered.

It is a potent anaesthetic with poor analgesic and muscle relaxant propeies. Halothane causes direct depression of myocardial contractility by reducing intracellular Ca. It causes fall in BP and CO. Hea rate decreases due to vagal stimulation. It tends to sensitize the hea to arrhythmogenic action of adrenaline - contraindicated in pheochromocytoma. It causes greater depression of respiration and ventilation perfusion mismatch. It dilates the bronchi - inhalation agent of choice in asthmatics (intravaneous anaesthetic of choice in asthmatics is ketamine). It is a hepatotoxic drug and can also cause malignant hypehermia (Succinylcholine accentuate it). Recovery is smooth and reasonably quick. It causes postanaesthetic shivering and chills. It inhibits intestinal and uterine contractions - agent of choice for assisting external or internal version during late pregnancy.

However, delay in diagnosis is common, and patients may present with flank pain, fevers, and signs of sepsis, ileus, or decreased urine output. CT scan may demonstrate hydronephrosis or a fluid collection (urinoma). Initial diagnosis and management should include urinalysis, although hematuria may not always be present; percutaneous nephrostomy tube or retrograde ureteral catheterization; percutaneous drainage of fluid collections; and identification of the location of ureteral injury. Surgical management should be delayed if diagnosis is late (10-14 days), and operative strategy is dependent on the location of the injury.

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Whenever significant bleeding is noted in the early postoperative period, the presumption should always be that it is due to an error in surgical control of blood vessels in the operative field. Hematologic disorders that are not apparent during the long operation are most unlikely to surface as problems postoperatively. Blood transfusion reactions can cause diffuse loss of clot integrity; the sudden appearance of diffuse bleeding during an operation may be the only evidence of an intraoperative transfusion reaction. In the postoperative period, transfusion reactions usually present as unexplained fever, apprehension, and headache--all symptoms difficult to interpret in the early postoperative period. Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia) would almost ceainly be known by history in a 65-year-old man, but, if not, intraoperative bleeding would have been a problem earlier in this long operation. Moreover, factor VIII deficiency causes prolongation of the paial thromboplastin time (PTT), which is normal in this patient. Severely hypothermic patients will not be able to form clots effectively, but clot dissolution does not occur. Care should be taken to prevent the development of hypothermia during long operations through the use of warmed intravenous fluid, gas humidifiers, and insulated skin barriers."

    "explanation": "Ether was used for frivolous purposes (\"ether frolics\"), but not as an anesthetic agent in humans until 1842, when Crawford W. Long and William E. Clark independently used it on patients for surgery and dental extraction, respectively. However, neither Long nor Clark publicized his discovery. Four years later, in Boston, on October 16, 1846, William T.G. Moon conducted the first publicized demonstration of general anesthesia for surgical operation using ether. The dramatic success of that exhibition led the operating surgeon to exclaim to a skeptical audience: \"Gentlemen, this is no humbug!\" Joseph Priestley produced nitrous oxide in 1772, and Humphry Davy first noted its analgesic propeies in 1800. Gardner Colton and Horace Wells are credited with having first used nitrous oxide as an anesthetic for dental extractions in humans in 1844.

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "The only depolarizing type of neuromuscular blocker in clinical use is succinylcholine (SCh). Succinylcholine mimics acetylcholine in action and it causes muscle relaxation by causing persistent depolarization of motor end plate. This is also known as phase I blockade. Repeated doses or continuous infusion may cause phase II block. Clinically relevant phase II block can occur with total succinylcholine doses as low as 4 mg/kg in some patients, with either repeat dosing or continuous infusions. Such block may be evident with tetanic stimulation in highly sensitive muscle groups, later respiratory muscles are involved. Patients having abnormal pseudocholinesterase experiences prolonged paralysis after administration of succinylcholine. Ref: Anaesthesia By M.

It produces effects similar to other local anaesthetics reversible inhibition of sodium ion influx in nerve fibres. Ropivacaine is less lipophilic than bupivacaine and is less likely to penetrate large myelinated motor fibres, resulting in a relatively reduced motor blockade. Thus, ropivacaine has a greater degree of motor sensory differentiation, which could be useful when motor blockade is undesirable. The reduced lipophilicity is also associated with decreased potential for central nervous system toxicity and cardiotoxicity. The drug displays linear and dose propoional pharmacokinetics (up to 80 mg administered intravenously). It is metabolised extensively in the liver and excreted in urine."

Epinephrine, in concentrations of 5 mcg/ml, is commonly used to decrease the absorption of local anesthetics. A 5 mcg/ml (1:200,000) dose of epinephrine will significantly reduce the peak blood levels of lidocaine and mepivacaine regardless of the site of administration. Epinephrine does not affect the vascular absorption of etidocaine and bupivacaine in the epidural space. However, the addition of epinephrine does significantly reduce the vascular absorption of etidocaine and bupivacaine when utilized for peripheral nerve blocks. Benefits of decreased absorption include increased neuronal uptake, enhanced quality of analgesia/anesthesia, prolonged duration of action, and decreased risk of toxicity. A concentration of 1:200,000 (5 mcg/ml) is commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks to reduce vascular absorption."

We consider, however, that\nfurther conclusive trials are required before the manufacturer's weight-based recommendations are altered.\nJudging the correct size of LMA can be difficult since the relationship between gender, weight, height, and upper airway geometry appears inconsistent.\nNo factors have yet been identified that give an easy measurement of potential pharyngeal volume directly correlating with appropriate LMA size, and certainly, there is no known anatomical difference between the male and the female adult or child pharynx at a given weight.\nSome practitioners consider that the smaller sizes are satisfactory for spontaneous ventilation since a less effective seal is required. However, too small a mask may still result in local soft tissue damage due to poor fit around the laryngeal inlet or misplacement into the upper oesophagus or the glottic inlet.\nThe problems associated with insertion of too large a mask (airway obstruction, airway reflex activation) are probably fewer than those associated with insertion of too small a mask."

The sensor is placed on the patient's forehead to pick up the electrical signals from the cerebral coex and transfer them to the digital signal conveer. BIS technology is available as a stand-alone unit, or as a modular solution integrated into the manufacturer's monitoring system."

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Propofol Ambulatory (outpatient/day care) anaesthesia -* Ambulatory or day care or outpatient anaesthesia means, patient comes on same day, gets operated and is discharged on same day. So, the drugs used in outpatient anaesthesia are those which have short duration of action. Anaesthetic techniques and agents ideal for day care surgery are: -Premedication* Usually premedication is not used. However in anxious patients, midazolam is the drug of choice, which should be given 1-2 hours before the surgery with sip of water by oral route or 30 min. before surgery by im route. If patient is prone to nausea and vomiting, dolasetron is the drug of choice. Ondansetron is an alternative.Airway* Laryngeal mask airway is preferred over intubation.Intravenous anaesthetics* Intravenous route is the preferred method for induction. Propofol is the intravenous anaesthetic of choice for induction because of its smooth induction and rapid recovery. Antiemetic action of propofol is also beneficial - use of propofol for induction or maintenance of anaesthesia is associated with a reduced incidence of post- operative nausea and vomiting.Inhalational agents* Inhalational anaesthetics are preferred for the maintenance. Desflurane (1st choice) and sevoflurane (2nd choice are the agents of choice. These agents are used along with N2O as N2O decreases the requirement of other anaesthetics hence fastening the recovery. Halothane and isoflurane have largely been replaced by the less soluble desflurane and sevoflurane.Muscle relaxants* Mivacurium is the muscle relaxant of choice because of its short duration of action. Succinylcholine should be avoided as it causes post-operative myalgia. However, if intubation is required, succinylcholine remains the agent of choice.Opioid analgesics* Opioids compounds are frequently administered during anaesthesia to suppress autonomic responses to tracheal intubation and painful (noxious) surgical stimuli. These drugs are also useful supplements to inhaled anaesthetics during maintenance period. Alfentanil is the agent of choice because of rapid onset and shorter duration of action. Remifentanil is emerging as an alternative because of much shorter duration of action. Fentanyl or sufentanil can also be used."

It causes sustained paial depolarization of muscle end plate --> intially produce twitching and fasciculation followed by flaccid paralysis. It is the shoest and fastest acting skeletal muscle relaxant. It is the only muscle relaxant which stimulate autonomic ganglia and vagus. SCh is the most commonly used muscle relaxant for passing endotracheal tube (mivacurium and rocuronium are alternatives). SCh is rapidly hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase, some patients have genetically determined abnormality or deficiency of pseudocholinesterase, in them, SCh causes phase II block. It can cause muscle fasiculations and soreness, change in BP and HR, arrythmia, histamine release and IC efflux from muscles. Dangerous hyperkalemia can occur in patients with burn, crush injury, muscular dystrophy, GB.

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "The maximal safe total dose of lidocaine administered to a 70-kg person is 4.5 mg/kg, or approximately 30 to 35 mL of a 1% solution. The addition of epinephrine to lidocaine, procaine, or bupivacaine not only doubles the duration of infiltration anesthesia, but increases the maximal safe total dose by one-third (eg, 7 mg/kg for lidocaine with epinephrine) by decreasing the rate of absorption of drug into the bloodstream. However, epinephrinecontaining solutions should not be injected into tissues supplied by end aeries (eg, fingers, toes, ears, nose, penis). Hypersensitivity to local anesthetics is uncommon and occurs most prominently with anesthetics of the ester type (procaine, tetracaine). While small nerve fibers seem to be most susceptible to the action of local anesthetics, these agents act on any pa of the nervous system and on every type of nerve fiber. CNS toxicity usually appears as stimulation followed by depression, probably because of an early selective depression of inhibitory neurons; with a massive overdose, all neurons may be depressed simultaneously"

Significance: Hyperbaric solutions tend to move to the most dependent area of the spine. With the patient in a head-down position, a hyperbaric solution spreads cephalad, and a hypobaric anesthetic solution moves caudal. A head-up position causes a hyperbaric solution to settle caudally and a hypobaric solution to ascend cephalad. An isobaric solution tends to remain at the level of injection."

When oliguria occurs postoperatively, it is impoant to differentiate between low output caused by the physiologic response to intravascular hypovolemia and that caused by acute tubular necrosis. A FENa of less than 1% in an oliguric setting indicates aggressive sodium reclamation in the tubules. Values above this suggest a tubular injury such that Na cannot be appropriately reclaimed. In the setting of postoperative hypovolemia, all findings would reflect the kidney's effos to retain volume: the urine sodium would be below 20 mEq/L, the urine chloride would not be helpful except in the metabolically alkalotic patient, the urine osmolality would be over 500 mOsm/kg, the urine/serum creatinine ratio would be above 20, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio would be above 20."

As a result, N2O stas diffusing out of the blood into alveoli while N2 diffuses into blood. Due to the difference in solubilities of the two gases, N2O diffuses out more rapidly as it has high solubility. This diluted other gases present in alveoli and relative concentration of O2 falls. It is termed as diffusion hypoxia. Clinical Significance : 100% oxygen should be given for at least 5-10minutes after switching off N2O in order to overcome the relative fall of O2 concentration in the alveoli during Recovery from general anesthesia."

      "All of the above"

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Volume - controlled ventilation, where the inflation volume is preselected, and the ventilator automatically adjusts the inflation pressure to deliver the desired volume. the rate of lung inflation can be constant or decelerating. Advantages of volume control ventilation Guaranteed tidal volumes produce a more stable minute volume.The reliability of the minute volume makes this mode of ventilation more appropriate in situations where careful control of PaCO2is of impoance. Volume controlled modes were the standard of care for patients with severe traumatic brain injury where tight PaCO2 control is necessary. The minute volume remains stable over a range of changing pulmonary characteristics.If airway resistance fluctuates significantly (eg. in the course of therapy for status asthmaticus) this mode has the advantage of maintaining a reliable minute volume. The initial flow rate is lower than in pressure-controlled modes. This is an advantage if airway resistance is high; blowing more slowly into the tight bronchi does not produce a high resistance-related early pressure peak, and potentially prevents an early termination of the breath by the pressure alarm limit. Disadvantages of volume control ventilation The mean airway pressure is lower with volume control ventilation,due to the slopy shape of the pressure waveform. This can theoretically be a disadvantage in patients who have severe hypoxia; in those people one might want to use a pressure-controlled mode instead. One wa of getting around this is to use an inspiratory pause, which is discussed elsewhere (in summary, it doesn't work and possibly increases the work of breathing). Recruitment may be poorer in lung units with poor compliance.Units with a long time constant and poor compliance may remain unrecruited until very late in the inspiratory phase when pressure approaches its maximum value. These units will have little time for gas exchange before the ventilator cycles to expiration. From this, one might expect that with a volume-controlled mode the degree of atelectasis will be greater than with a pressure controlled mode, peak aiway pressures being equal. In the presence of a leak, the mean airway pressure may be unstable.The constant flow used during VCV may not be able to compensate for an intermittent leak.Consider: if the leak flow rate is equal to the inspiratory flow rate, there will be no volume delivered. Insufficient flow may give rise to patient-ventilatordyssynchrony.In the presence of increased respiratory demand during the course of a breath, the ventilator may not meet the patient's need for increased flow."

Patients who have sustained trauma with extensive blood loss are typical candidates for rapid-sequence anesthesia induction with ketamine. Patients with septic shock also may benefit from ketamine. The intrinsic myocardial depressant effect of ketamine may manifest in this situation if trauma or sepsis has caused depletion of catecholamine stores before the patient's arrival in the operating room.

Both mechanisms lead to formation of Laudanosine. Laudanosine depends on liver for clearance (70% bile excretion). Laudanosine at high plasma levels can cause cerebral excitation and seizure activity in animals, (but this has not been a clinical problem in humans.)In animals receiving Laudanosine infusion who are anaesthetised: Plasma cone. > 6 mcg/ml causes hypotension, >10 mcg/ml cause EEG epileptic spike, >17 mcg/ml causes seizures (Chappie et al 1987).A full paralyzing dose of Atracurium (0.5mg/kg) causes Laudanosine levels of only 0.3 mcg/ml. Also, in presence of anaesthetic agents, CNS depression is present, & Atracurium induced muscle relaxation will prevent muscle movement due to seizure activity.However, in the ICU, where anaesthetic agents are not present, there is a theoretical possibility of laudanosine-induced CNS stimulation.

To provide effective preoxygenation, a methodical approach is necessary. The impoance of preoxygenation with a tight-fitting mask should be explained to the patient beforehand. Once preoxygenation is initiated, EtO2 and FIO2 values should be monitored closely. If the EtO2 value does not increase as expected, the anesthesia provider may have to hold the mask with both hands and/or replace the mask with a better-fitting one. Whenever possible, the induction should not sta until the EtO2 value approximates or exceeds 90%.. the ideal time period is 3 minutes."

    ],
    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "EVOKED POTENTIALS: The purpose of intraoperative evoked potentials is to monitor neural pathways in hopes of avoiding iatrogenic injury to the nervous system. Sensory evoked potentials (SEPs) evaluate the integrity of ascending sensory tracts while motor evoked potentials (MEPs) deal with the functionality of descending motor pathways. SENSORY EVOKED POTENTIALS Three SEP modalities are used clinically: somatosensory (SSEP), auditory (BAEP), and visual (VEP). The amplitude of these potentials is much smaller than that of the background EEG and must be extracted from the surrounding \"noise\" using signal averaging. The compromise of a neurologic pathway is evident with an increase in the latency and/or a decrease in the amplitude of EP waveforms. All anesthetics influence EP waveforms to some degree. EPs of coical origin (i.e. the coical poion of SSEPs and VEPs) are considered more prone to modification by anesthetics than brainstem potentials (i.e. BAEPs and subcoical poions of SSEPs). It is imperative to maintain constant anesthetic drug levels during the recording of EPs. Bolusing IV infusions or abrupt changes in MAC values of inhaled agents can be detrimental, paicularly during critical poions of a procedure. When recording coical EPs (SSEPs and VEPs) one should generally incorporate intravenous techniques as high concentrations of volatiles can eliminate coical EPs. Neveheless, all volatile anesthetics increase coical latency and decrease coical amplitude. However, desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be more forgiving with SSEPs than agents such as enflurane and isoflurane. For instance, desflurane at up to 1 MAC without nitrous oxide is compatible with coical median nerve SSEP monitoring during scoliosis surgery. The use of nitrous oxide should probably be avoided during EP monitoring as it exhibits profound depressant effects on SSEPs and VEPs when combined with a volatile agent. SSEPs: Pathway = Dorsal columns (UE)/lateral funiculus (LE). Electrical stimulation of mixed nerve, coical sho-latency waveforms measured. Decreased amplitude of 50% + 10% prolongation in latency is significant. Signal averaged. Volatiles = dose-dependent decrease in amplitude, increase in latency (< 1.0 MAC is ideal, not required) Brainstem potentials are quite resilient about anesthetics and are considered compatible with most anesthetic regimens. Regarding IV agents, studies on thiopental have shown that even with doses far over what is required to produce an isoelectric EEG, SSEP, and BAEP waveforms are preserved even if there is a predictable increase in latency and decrease in amplitude. Propofol increases latency and decreases the amplitude of coical EPs, but is considered an integral component of balanced intravenous neurosurgical anesthesia. Opioids produce minimal changes in SEP waveforms, even in high doses. Because of this, they are recommended for use as infusions during EP monitoring. Both clonidine and dexmedetomidine decrease anesthetic requirements and have minimal effects on coical EPs and are considered safe to use during monitoring. For practical purposes, ALL intravenous agents have a negligible effect on coical SSEP's, except for etomidate and ketamine, which can increase the amplitude. Propofol, in concentrations sufficient to induce burst suppression, will abolish later coical responses, but not the primary coical responses (N20/P22 for median nerve, P40/N45 for tibial nerve), which are used for monitoring. MOTOR EVOKED POTENTIALS: Transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor strip is a reliable method of producing intraoperative motor potentials that can be recorded from the spinal cord, peripheral nerve, or muscle. MEPs are exquisitely sensitive to anesthetics, especially inhalational agents. Volatiles, therefore, should be avoided during the recording of myogenic MEPs. Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and propofol all depress MEPs, however, adequate recordings can be obtained during propofol anesthesia by controlling serum levels and increasing stimuli rates. Muscle relaxants can affect the recorded EMG response by depressing myoneural transmission. isHowever, adequate MEP recordings can be achieved as long as one or two twitches on TOF can be maintained.

So it rapidly diffuse into alveoli & dilutes the alveolar air-Partial Pressure of O2 in alveoli is reduced i.e. diffusion hypoxiaDiffusion hypoxia is prevented by administering 100% oxygen for 5-10 min after discontinuing N2OPoynting effect: Entonox (50% O2 & 50% N2O) & mixture of gases (O2 & N2O) keeps them in gaseous form.If another potent anesthetic eg. Halothane is added, it also will be delivered to the blood at a rate higher than minute volume & the induction will be faster.N2O is a good analgesic but weak anaesthetic and poor muscle relaxant. Hence it is not a complete anaesthetic.N2O has blood gas coefficient of 0.47 and has fast inductionIt has MAC value of 104; Hence Potency is lowN2O is used as a carrier gas given in a mixture of 33% O2 and 66% N2OContraindications for N2O:Middle ear surgeries and tympanoplastyLaparoscopic surgeriesAcute intestinal obstruction and volvulusMicrolaryngeal surgeriesPneumothorax, pneumoperitoniumEye surgeriesPneumoencephalos.It should be avoided in patients with pulmonary hypertensionAdverse effects: bone marrow depression (agranulocytosis, megaloblastic anemia) and even neurological deficiencies (peripheral neuropathies and pernicious anemia).NOTE:Nitrous oxide is one of the most common anesthetics used in dental procedures.

Ionized form of local anaesthetics is the one that binds to sodium channels, but non-ionized form is the one that is important for membrane penetration. That is the reason for delayed onset of local anaesthetics in site of infection."

    "question": "A 26-year-old man is resuscitated with packed red blood cells following a motor vehicle collision complicated by a fractured pelvis and resultant hemorrhage. A few hours later the patient becomes hypotensive with a normal central venous pressure (CVP), oliguric, and febrile. Upon examination, the patient is noted to have profuse oozing of blood from his intravenous (IV) sites. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "Transfusion reactions can be categorized into hemolytic versus allergic nonhemolytic reactions. Hemolytic transfusion reactions are caused by complementmediated destruction of transfused red blood cells by the recipient's preexisting antibodies. Severe hemolytic transfusion reactions usually involve the transfusion of ABO-incompatible blood, with fatalities occurring in 1 in 600,000 units. Peptides from the complement, released into the blood as the red blood cells are rapidly destroyed, cause hypotension, activate coagulation, and lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Symptoms of a hemolytic transfusion reaction include fever, chills, pain and redness along the infused vein, oozing from IV sites, respiratory distress, anxiety, hypotension, and oliguria. The patient would have a low CVP with hypovolemic shock. Acute adrenal insufficiency, gram-negative bacteremia, and ureteral obstruction would not cause oozing from the IV sites."

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "The extent and location of inhaled anesthetic metabolism depends on multiple chemical factors. Inhaled anesthetics undergo varying degrees of biotransformation in various tissues. Methoxyflurane undergoes by far the greatest metabolism, estimated at 70%, and experiments indicate that only a small fraction of drug taken up into body tissues is exhaled. Given the remarkable lipophilicity of methoxyflurane, respiratory clearance of this drug from muscle and fat extends over a period of days. Halothane is the next most lipophilic drug and ranks second in metabolic clearance. Thus, prolonged residence in body tissues is an impoant factor in the biotransformation of inhaled anesthetics. Chemical stability is another impoant factor. Of the major organs involved in anesthetic biotransformation, the liver and kidneys are exposed to the highest metabolite concentrations and thus are most susceptible to damage from toxic metabolites. Clinically significant hepatotoxicity is primarily associated with exposure to halothane, and nephrotoxicity is associated with methoxyflurane. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition"

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., 4 to 5 days Warfarin may increase peri- operative bleeding, except for minor procedures such as cataract surgery without bulbar blocks. No consensus exists on the optimal perioperative management of patients receiving warfarin. The usual recommendation is to withhold warfarin staing 4 to 5 days preoperatively (if the INR is between 2.0 and 3.0) to allow the INR to decrease to less than 1.5, which is a level considered safe for surgical procedures and neuraxial blockade. If the INR is greater than 3.0, it is usually necessary to withhold warfarin longer than 4 to 5 days. If the INR is measured the day before the surgical procedure and remains higher than 1.8, a small dose of vitamin K (1 to 5 mg administrated orally or subcutaneously) can reverse anticoagulation. Vitamin K has an effect within 6 to 10 hours after oral or subcutaneous administration (more predictable with oral administration), and it peaks within 24 hours to 48 hours. Administration of higher doses may lead to warfarin resistance when therapy is initiated again."

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "The development of acute postoperative cholecystitis is an increasingly recognized complication of the severe illnesses that precipitate admissions to the ICU. The causes are obscure but probably lead to a common final pathway of gallbladder ischemia. The diagnosis is often extremely difficult because the signs and symptoms may be those of occult sepsis. Moreover, the patients are often intubated, sedated, or confused as a consequence of the other therapeutic or medical factors. Biochemical tests, though frequently revealing abnormal liver function, are nonspecific and nondiagnostic. Bedside ultrasonography is usually strongly suggestive of the diagnosis when a thickened gallbladder wall or pericholecystic fluid is present; nonvisualization of the gallbladder on a nuclear medicine (HIDA) scan can also be diagnostic. If diagnosis is delayed, moality and morbidity are very high. Percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder is usually curative of acalculous cholecystitis and affords stabilizing palliation if calculous cholecystitis is present. Antibiotics without drainage are too cautious a choice for a patient with a potentially fatal complication. Operative intervention is indicated only if less invasive methods of treatment (percutaneous cholecystostomy tube) have failed, and ERCP is not indicated in the absence of ductal obstruction."

    "explanation": "Drug must have entered subarachnoid space and resulted in total spinal anesthesia. The occurrence of a high regional block or total spinal can be potentially catastrophic and require immediate management. They may occur following spinal or epidural anaesthesia and therefore can occur outside of the operating theatre. Both are due to the inappropriately high spread of local anaesthetic affecting spinal nerves and as such are on a continuum of severity: ? High spinal/regional block: spread of local anaesthetic affecting the spinal nerves above T4. The effects are of variable severity depending upon the maximum level that is involved, but can include cardiovascular and/or respiratory compromise. ? Total spinal: intracranial spread of local anaesthetic resulting in loss of consciousness. A total spinal can also occur following epidural anaesthesia/analgesia. As the above are different severities of the same process, they may both be referred to as high regional block. Left untreated, a high regional block can progress to a total spinal. TOTAL spinal anesthesia is a complication that follows inadveent introduction of local anesthetics into the intracranial subarachnoid space. Clinical features- Hypotension, bradycardia , respiratory depression followed by neurological symptoms. The clinical features are dependent on the level of the spinal nerves affected by the local anaesthetic. Untreated the block may ascend fuher leading to more severe features as shown below: Spinal level Area(s) affected Symptoms/signs T1-T4 Cardiac sympathetic fibres blocked Hypotension Bradycardia C6-C8 Hands and arms Paraesthesia or numbness in hands/arms Weakness of hands/arms Shoness of breath (accessory respiratory muscles affected) C3-5 Diaphragm and shoulders Shoulder weakness - respiratory compromise immenent Hypoventilation and/or desaturation Respiratory arrest Intracranial spread - Brain stem Slurred speech Sedation Loss of consciousness"

    "explanation": "Ans. C. Determining the appropriate placement of endotracheal tube. (Ref. Clinical Anesthesia by Paul 5th/pg. 670-671)Clinical Anesthesia by Paul 5th Edition/pg. 671..........\"Capnography is an essential element in determining the appropriate placement of endotracheal tubes. The presence of a stable ETCO2 for three successive breaths indicates that the tube is not in the esophagus. A continuous, stable CO2 waveform ensures the presence of alveolar ventilation but does not necessarily indicate that the endotracheal tube is properly positioned in the trachea. For example, the tip of the tube could be located in a main-stem bronchus. Capnography is also a monitor of potential changes in perfusion or dead space, is a very sensitive indicator of anesthetic circuit disconnects and gas circuit leaks, and is a method to detect the quality of CO2 absorption\".Endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway insertion requires qualitative identification of carbon dioxide in the expired gas. During general anesthesia, capnography and end-tidal carbon dioxide analysis are encouraged. Capnometry is the measurement and numeric representation of the C02 concentration during inspiration and expiration. A capnogram is a continuous concentration-time display of the C02 concentration sampled at a patient's airway during ventilation.Capnography# is the continuous monitoring of a patient's capnogram.# The capnogram is divided into four distinct phases (Fi. The first phase (A-B) represents the initial stage of expiration. Gas sampled during this phase occupies the anatomic dead space and is normally devoid of CO2. At point B, CO2- containing gas presents itself at the sampling site, and a sharp upstroke (B-C) is seen in the capnogram. The slope of this upstroke is determined by the evenness of ventilation and alveolar emptying. Phase C-D represents the alveolar or expiratory plateau. At this phase of the capnogram, alveolar gas is being sampled. Normally, this part of the waveform is almost horizontal. Point D is the highest CO2 value and is called the end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2). ETCO2 is the best reflection of the alveolar CO2 (PACO2). As the patient begins to inspire, fresh gas is entrained and there is a steep downstroke (D-E) back to baseline. Unless rebreathing of CO2 occurs, the baseline approaches zero.# The utility of capnography depends on an understanding of the relationship between arterial CO2 (PaCO2), alveolar CO2 (PACO2), and ETCO2. If the PaCO2-PACO2 gradient is constant and small, capnography provides a noninvasive, continuous, real-time reflection of ventilation. During general anesthesia, the ETC02-PaC02 gradient typically is 5 to 10 mm Hg.# Maldistribution is a common cause of an increased PaCO2-PACO2 gradient. Other patient factors that may influence the accuracy of ETCO2 monitoring by widening the PaCO2-ETCO2 gradient include shallow tidal breaths, prolongation of the expiratory phase of ventilation, or uneven alveolar emptying.# Increases in ETCO2 can be expected when CO2 production exceeds ventilation, such as in hyperthermia or when an exogenous source of CO2 is present# A sudden drop in ETCO2 to near zero followed by the absence of a CO2 waveform is a potentially life-threatening problem that could indicate malposition of an endotracheal tube into the pharynx or esophagus, sudden severe hypotension, pulmonary embolism, a cardiac arrest, or an artifact resulting from disruption of sampling lines. During life-saving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the generation of adequate perfusion can be assessed by the restoration of the CO2 waveform.# Whereas abrupt decreases in the ETCO2 are often associated with an altered cardiopulmonary status (e.g., embolism or hypoperfusion), gradual reductions in ETCO2 more often reflect decreases in PaCO2 that occur after increases in minute ventilation where ventilation overmatches CO2 production.# Several methods for the quantification of CO2 have been applied to patient monitoring systems. One of the most commonly used methods is based on infrared absorption spectrophotometry (IRAS).Additional Educational points:# ETCO2 is the best reflection of the alveolar CO2 tension.# Increase in ETCO2 is the most sensitive early sign of malignant hyperthermia.6Most Sensitsive|||||Transesophageal echocardiographyPrecordial DopplerPulmonary artery catheter (| PAP)Capnography (|ETCO2)Mass spectrometry (| ETN2 most specific and quantitative)Least SensitivePAP= pulmonary artery pressure; ETCO2= end-tidal carbon dioxide; ETN2=end-tidal nitrogen."

This is to ensure a line of sight from the mouth to the larynx so that intubation can be performed with ease. Cervical flexion of 35 degrees is provided by elevating the patient's head by 7-9 cm (folded sheet under the head). This aligns the pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. Atlantooccipital extension is provided by the head tilt. This brings into alignment the visual axis of the mouth with that of pharyngeal and laryngeal axes.

    "explanation": "This is the controversial one. Most of the guides have given option 'a' i.e. lowering the head end as the answer. Their logic is that, if the head end is lowered, the anesthetic drug will move up and will produce severe hypotension and bradycardia.\nHowever, all texts books have mentioned that in the management of hypotension after spinal anesthesia, head low position (Trendelenburg position) should be given to increase the venous return.\n\n\"Head low position (Trendelenburg position) to increase the venous return. Although the concern of trendelenburg position increases the chances of high spinal anesthesia, but number of studies have proven that the beneficial effects over weigh these problems and secondly head low up to 15° does not significantly increase the level of block. So, trendelenburg up to 15° does not significantly increase the level of block.

In clinical practice this oculocardiac reflex (Trigeminovagal reflex) is most often encountered during squint surgery in children. OCR is also seen during eye muscle surgery, repair of detached retina, compression of gasserian ganglion 13, enucleation of eye and by contact lens and repair of nasal fracture under General Anaesthesia. Prophylactic anti cholinergic is recommended and adequate cardiac monitoring must accompany these interventions as immediate action may be required. OCR may be manifest by bradycardia, bigeminey, ectopic beats, nodal rhythm, AV block and cardiac arrest.Oculocardiac Reflex (Trigeminovagal Reflex)# Bernard Aschner and Guiseppe Dagnini first described the oculocardiac reflex in 1 908. This reflex is triggered by pressure on the globe and by traction on the extraocular muscles, as well as on the conjunctiva or the orbital structures.# This reflex is clinically significant during strabismus surgery in children, although the manifestations of this reflex are not consistent. The oculocardiac reflex (OCR) is induced by pressure on the eyeball.# The afferent pathway follows the long and short ciliary nerves to the ciliary ganglion. From there, it travels to the gasserian ganglion body along the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). The afferent pathway ends in the main trigeminal sensory nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle.# Efferent impulses start at the vasomotor center and travel through the vagal nerve (CN X) and the sympathetic chain. Bradycardia is the result of increasing parasympathetic tone. Decreasing sympathetic tone causes vasodilatation.# The cardiac effect stops when eye pressure is relieved. Patients should be monitored to recognize ECG changes. Atropine should be available to reverse life-threatening bradycardia."

MH may occasionally present more than an hour after emergence from an anesthetic, and rarely may occur without exposure to known triggering agents. Most cases have been repoed in young males; almost none have been repoed in infants, and few have been repoed in the elderly. Neveheless, all ages and both sexes may be affected. The incidence of MH varies significantly from country to country and even among different geographic localities within the same country, reflecting varying gene pools. The upper Midwest appears to have the greatest incidence of MH in the United States. Anesthetic drugs that trigger MH include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and depolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used.

Though fungi have also been implicated, they are less often associated with rapidly progressive infections. Treatment for necrotizing soft tissue infections includes repeated wide debridement, with wound reconstruction delayed until a stable, ble wound surface has been established. The use of hyperbaric O2 in the treatment of gas gangrene remains controversial, due to lack of proven benefit, difficulty in transpoing critically ill patients to hyperbaric facilities, and the risk of complications.

Ch 25The most important information in the above question is that the patient is 70 yrs old, i.e, of a geriatric age. Geriatric patients have a lot of anaesthetic implications. As a rule, we must consider shorter acting agents in these patients.Our body can be considered to be divided into 3 compartments when we inject any drug. These compartments are formed on the basis of the speed with which the drug reaches various parts of the body.Three-compartment model (including the biophase) schematizing the basic pharmacokinetic processes that occur after intravenous drug administration.I = dosing scheme as a function of timekl0 = Rate constant reflecting all processes acting to irreversibly remove drug from the central compartmentVI = central compartment volume, usually expressed in liters or liters per kilogram.Central compartment-blood, highly vascular tissues like brain - The effect of Anaesthetic drugs primarily depends on the duration of drug in central compartment & volume of the compartment since they primarily act on CNSIntermediate compartment-intermediate blood supply organs like skeletal musclesPeripheral compartment-adipose tissue - responsible for storage & delayed release of drugs into circulationGeriatric patients have an increased fat mass and decreased muscle mass. Also, they are dehydrated leading to contraction of the central compartment. Thus, more drug is present in the central compartment on immediate injection (causing a profound effect at a normal dose), & more fat is available for delayed release of drugs back into the circulation, leading to prolonged action of drugs (see figure)They may have a decreased renal & hepatic clearanceDecreased cardiac output may contribute to a slow onset of drug effects followed by prolonged action secondary to delayed clearance (i.e.f barbiturates, benzodiazepines).Minimal alveolar concentration of inhalation anesthetics decreases with age (6% for each decade after age 40), which parallels loss of neurons and decreased cerebral metabolism.Short-acting intravenous drugs and volatile anesthetics with lower partition coefficients provide the advantage of more rapid elimination, brisk emergence, and reorientation to the patient's surroundings, and potentially lower incidence of confusion and delirium during recovery. However, the recovery of cognitive function, measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, has not been shown to be different between various agents.Desflurane is associated with the most rapid emergence. (It has a low solubility hence faster onset & shorter time for emergence)A more predictable method of opioid titration may be to use a shorter acting opioid such as remifentanil. By adjusting the bolus and infusion doses, the variability in remifentanil pharmacokinetics is considerably less than for other intravenous opioids. (Morphine has a much longer duration of action)Similarly, it may be prudent to use shorter acting muscle relaxants. Studies show that there is an increased incidence of postoperative residual block and pulmonary complications in patients receiving pancuronium compared with atracurium or vecuronium. Atracurium depends to a small extent on hepatic metabolism and excretion, and elimination half-life is prolonged in elderly patients. Clearance is unchanged with age, however, suggesting that alternative pathways of elimination (ester hydrolysis and Hofmann elimination) assume importance in elderly patients.CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OF ANESTHETIC AGENTS IN ELDERLY PATIENTSDrugBrain SensitivityPharmacokineticsDoseinhaled agents|--|Thiopental--|Initial distribution volume|Etomidate--|Initial distribution volume| |Clearance Propofol||Clearance|Midazolam||Clearance|Morphine||Clearance|Sufentanil|--|Alfentanil| |Fentanyl| |Remifentanil||Clearance-- |Central compartment volume|PancuroniumNA|Clearance|AtracuriumNA----CisatracuriumNA----VecuroniumNA|Clearance|"

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Anesthesia is injected in subarachnoid space * In spinal anesthesia LA is injected into subarachnoid space (space between pia matter and arachnoid matter).* Structure pierced during SA (from outside in) - Skin - subcutaneous tissue - Supraspinous & intraspinous ligament - Ligamentum falvum - Durameter - Arachnoid matter.* Site of spinal anesthesia is L2-3 or L3-4 intervertebral space in adult (In adult spinal cord ends at lower border of Llvertebrae). In children it is L4-5 intervertebral space (spinal cord ends at lower border L3 vertebrae in children).* Spinal anesthesia leads to creation of a zone of differential blockade, i.e., motor fibres are blocked two levels lower and autonomic fibers are blocked two levels higher than the sensory blockade due to different sensitivity of different fibers.* High spinal (Total spinal) anesthesia: - It occurs when the effect of spinal anesthesia ascends to higher (cervical) levels. It can also occur following attempted epidural/caudal anesthesia if there is inadvertent intrathecal injection. It causes severe hypotension, bradycardia and respiratory insufficiency with loss of consciousness.About other options* Hypotension is the most common complication of spinal anesthesia.* The onset of analgesia is approximately 15-30 minutes in an epidural, while it is approximately 5 minutes in spinal anesthesia."

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "During pregnancy there is a reduction in the requirement of anaesthetic agent. Factors contributing to this are -increased levels of B-EP -increased neuronal sensitivity -vascular congestion in spinal canal and -increased levels of progesterone. Increased lumbar lordosis has not been mentioned any where as a contributing factor for decreasing requirement of anaesthetic agents in pregnancy. During pregnancy enlarged uterus obstructs the inferior venacava and distends epidural venous plexus and increases epidural blood volume. This inturn results in decreased spinal CSF volume, decreased potential volume of subarachnoid space and increased epidural space pressure. The first two effects enhance the spread of LA solutions during spinal and epidural anaesthesia respectively whereas last may predispose to higher incidence of dural puncture with epidural anaesthesia.

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "The first modern halogenated volatile anesthetic, halothane, was introduced in 1955. Clinical exposure to halothane is associated with two distinct types of hepatic injury. Subclinical hepatotoxicity occurs in 20% of adults who receive halothane. It is characterized by mild postoperative elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspaate aminotransferase, but is reversible and innocuous. Anaerobic halothane reduction by CYP2A6 to a 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethyl radical is thought to mediate this mild hepatic injury. The fulminant form of hepatotoxicity, commonly known as halothane hepatitis, It is characterized by elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspaate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, and massive hepatic necrosis following the administration of halothane. Halothane hepatitis is rare (1 in 5000 to 35,000 administrations in adults), but is fatal in 50% to 75% of these cases. Because of the potential for fatal hepatitis, halothane is no longer used in adult patients in many countries. Halothane hepatitis is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane. The highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane oxidation can react with nearby liver proteins. In most patients who developed hepatic necrosis after halothane anesthesia, antibodies against TFA-modified proteins were detected, suggesting that the hepatic damage is linked to an immune response against the modified protein, which acts as a neoantigen. Accordingly, patients who develop halothane hepatitis often have a history of prior exposures to halothane or other volatile anesthetics, together with symptoms suggestive of immune reactivity, such as fever, rash, ahralgia, and eosinophilia. A current hypothesis is that TFA-protein adducts induce a cytotoxic T cell reaction in sensitized individuals, which leads to liver damage. However, the immune responses observed in halothane hepatitis might not mediate liver injury. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e"

It can also occur as a genetically transmitted disorder in individuals with plasma cholinesterase activity. These patients develop apnoea even after standard dose of succinylcholine. Succinylcholine is normally inactivated by cholinesterase and in deficiency of this enzyme, there is prolonged muscle relaxing effect and patients are at high risk of developing fatal apnoea. Deficiency of this enzyme can be detected by measuring serum cholinesterase level or by estimating dibucaine number. Causes of aquired cholinesterase deficiency includes overexposure to pesticides, organophosphates or nerve gas, chronic liver disease, malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia."

    "explanation": "Ans. d. Deepen the plane of anesthesia (Ref: Yao and Artusio's Anesthesiology: Problem oriented Patient Management, 7th edition, by Fun-Sun F. Yao. Vinod Malhotra, and Manuel L. Fontes)On doing laparoscopic cholecystectomy patient developed wheezing, which should be treated by deepening of the plane of anesthesia.The most common cause of asthmatic attack during surgery is inadequate depth of anesthesia. First, deepen the level of anesthesia and increase FIO2. Remember that the patient is under anesthesia and undergoing surgery. Therefore, medical intervention, such as B-agonist administration, is not the first choice of treatment. - Yao and Artusio's AnesthesiologyIn the middle of surgery, the patient developed a severe wheezing attack. How do you manage it?First, deepen the level of anesthesia and increase FIO2, Remember that the patient is under anesthesia and undergoing surgery. Therefore, medical intervention, such as B-agonist administration, is not the first choice of treatment.The most common cause of asthmatic attack during surgery is inadequate depth of anesthesia.The patient with asthma has an extremely sensitive tracheobronchial tree. When the level of anesthesia is too light, the patient may develop bucking, straining, or coughing as a result of the foreign body (endotracheal tube) in the trachea and then bronchospasm.First, the blood pressure is taken to ensure it is normal or high, and then anesthesia is deepened by increasing the concentration of inhalation agents, such as sevoflurane, halothane, or isoflurane. which are direct bronchodilators as well.An incremental dose of ketamine maybe a quick way of maintaining blood pressure, rapidly deepening anesthesia, achieving bronchodilation, and avoiding the problem of delivering an inhaled anesthetic to a patient with poor ventilation.At the same time, oxygenation can be improved by increasing the inspired oxygen concentration and decreasing nitrous oxide. The patient should be continuously ventilated with a volume-cycled ventilator.Second, relieve mechanical stimulation. Pass a catheter through the endotracheal tube to suction secretions and determine whether there is an obstruction, kinking of the tube, or overinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff.The cuff of the endotracheal tube can be deflated, the tube moved back 1 to 2 cm, and the cuff reinflated. Occasionally, the endotracheal tube slips down and stimulates the carina of the trachea, causing severe bronchospasm during light anesthesia.Surgical stimulation, such as traction on the mesentery, intestine, or stomach, should be stopped temporarily, because it causes vagal reflex and can cause bronchospasm.Third, medical intervention is necessary if the previously mentioned treatment cannot break the bronchospasm or the anesthesia cannot be increased because of hypotension.The cornerstone of the treatment of the intraoperative bronchospasm is inhalation of B2-agonists such as albuterol, which induce further bronchodilation even in the presence of adequate inhalational anesthesia.Fourth, bring in an intensive care unit (ICU) ventilator. Anesthesia ventilators are not designed for patients with high airway resistance. An ICU ventilator can generate inspiratory pressures as high as 120 cm H2O. With low tubing compliance, little ventilation is wasted into the circuit."

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "VENTILATORY STRATEGIES in ARDS Low-Tidal-Volume Ventilation The cornerstone of ARDS management is a strategy of low-tidal-volume ventilation pioneered by the ARDSnet trial in 2000. This involves the following: \u0002 Tidal volume 6 ml/kg based on ideal body weight \u0002 Plateau pressure , 30 cm H2O \u0002 Permissive hypercapnoea tolerated as long as pH . 7.2 The lower tidal volumes were strongly associated with a decrease in moality and an increase in ventilator-free days. This was thought to be as a result of reducing excessive distension or stretch of the aerated lung, which could be associated with the release of proinflammatory cytokines that could contribute to lung (volutrauma) and other organ injury. Positive End-Expiratory Pressure PEEP prevents alveolar derecruitment, minimising atelectrauma. It increases functional residual capacity, displaces fluid from the alveoli into the interstitium, and moves the lung to the steeper pa of the compliance curve. However, this has to be balanced against potential hyperinflation and decreased venous return, and thus cardiac output.PEEP is patient-specific and determining the ''optimal'' PEEP for each patient is challenging. A number of different strategies (none of which have proven superiority) have been suggested to set PEEP: \u0002 Use of PEEP/FiO2 tables \u0002 Titrating based on plateau pressure \u0002 Stepwise increase until maximal compliance \u0002 Recruitment manoeuvre followed by decremental titration \u0002 Based upon the inflection point of the pressure/volume curve Guidelines recommend use of high PEEP (defined variably, but on average 15 cm H2O) on patients with moderate and severe ARDS, in whom a moality benefit was demonstrated in clinical trials. Prone-Position VentilationAlthough this has long been known to improve oxygenation, evidence of moality benefit has been lacking until recently. There are a number of postulated physiological benefits: improved recruitment of atelectatic dorsal lung tissue leading to its increased compliance of lungs (total compliance may actually decrease), more even distribution of tidal volume, and improved V/Q (V 1/4 pulmonary ventilation; Q 1/4 pulmonary perfusion) matching. Prone ventilation also decreases alveolar hyperinflation, reduces cardiac compression of the underlying lung, and improves drainage of secretions.

MH may occasionally present more than an hour after emergence from an anesthetic, and rarely may occur without exposure to known triggering agents. Most cases have been repoed in young males; almost none have been repoed in infants, and few have been repoed in the elderly. Neveheless, all ages and both sexes may be affected. The incidence of MH varies significantly from country to country and even among different geographic localities within the same country, reflecting varying gene pools. The upper Midwest appears to have the greatest incidence of MH in the United States. Anesthetic drugs that trigger MH include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and depolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used.

PP also improves resting lung volume in the dorsocaudal regions by reducing the superimposed pressure of both the hea and the abdomen. In contrast, pulmonary perfusion remains preferentially distributed to the dorsal lung regions, thus improving overall alveolar ventilation/perfusion relationships. Moreover, the larger tissue mass suspended from a wider dorsal chest wall effects a more homogeneous distribution of pleural pressures throughout the lung that reduces abnormal strain and stress development."

    "explanation": "Ans. is `B' i.e., Supraclavicular Brachial plexus block This is the second most commonly practised block after central neuraxial block (spinal & epidural anaesthesia). Brachial plexus block is used for upper limb surgeries. Brachial plexus can be blocked by 4 approaches : - 1. Interscalene approach Brachial plexus is blocked between anterior and middle scalene. This approach is not used routinely due to close proximity of vital structures. Ulnar nerve is usually spared by this approach because injection is given in close proximity of upper nerve roots and inferior nerve roots (C8-T 1) may be spared. This technique provides excellent anaesthesia and analgesia for shoulder and upper arm procedures. (in contrast to other three approaches which do not provide adequate shoulder anaesthesia). Complications include Horner syndrome (due to stellate ganglion block), phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection into carotids and epidural or intrathecal injections. 2. Supraclavicular approach This is the most commonly used approach. It involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity to the trunks of the brachial plexus by inseing the needle lateral to subclan vessels. The supraclavicular block is performed where the brachial plexus is most compact, consequently, it produces reliable and rapid onset anaesthesia and is paicularly useful in a fast paced ambulatory surgery centre. Pneumothorax is the most common complication. Other complications include phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection in subclan aery or vein, Horner syndrome, hematoma formation. 3. Infra-clavicular approach Infraclavicular block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of cords of the brachial plexus. The axillary nerve may be spared as this nerve exits the brachial plexus sheath proximal to the level of infraclavicular block. 4. Axillary approach Axillary block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of terminal branches of the brachial plexus. The major disadvantage of this approach is that mucocutaneous and intercostobrachial nerves are spared. So arm surgery cannot be performed. In contrast to interscalene approach, most intense block occur in (C7-T1) ulnar dermatomes and least in C5-C6 dermatomes."

Order of recovery is in reverse order.o Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure,o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sw'eet and sour, and salty taste last of all.o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated,o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres."

One caveat of administering large volumes of normal saline is that a non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis can result from increased chloride concentrations. Hypotonic saline solutions such as 0.45% normal saline should not be used for acute resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock but are appropriate for postoperative fluid maintenance in the hemodynamically stable patient. The use of colloids in resuscitation of patients in hemorrhagic shock is controversial; in general, however, colloids can be used to replace blood volume lost in a ratio of 1:1.

It causes fall in BP and CO. Hea rate decreases due to vagal stimulation. It tends to sensitize the hea to arrhythmogenic action of adrenaline --* contraindicated in pheochromocytoma. It causes greater depression of respiration and ventilation perfusion mismatch. It dilates the bronchi --> inhalation agent of choice in asthmatics (intravaneous anaesthetic of choice in asthmatics is ketamine).

In spinal anesthesia autonomic preganglionic sympathetic fibresQ are the earliest blocked fibres. Block of sympathetic nerves causes vasodialation of venous capacitance vessels, pooling of blood and HypotensionQ (most common complication of spinal anesthesiaQ). It is prevented by preloading with crystalloid. Following spinal subarachnoid block most common complication is hypotensionQ. During sub-arachnoid block, there is sympathetic blockade producing decreased venous return & hence, cardiac output and BP falls. So the patient can be managed by all the four means but the least effective & most controversial mean is lowering head end. The specific gravity (baricity) of CSF is 1.003 - 1.008Q at 37degC. A hyper baric solution of LA is denser than CSF & hypobaric solution of LA is Lighter than CSF. A LA solution can be made hyperbaric by adding glucose & hypobaric by addition of sterile water. Most impoant factors affecting level of spinal anesthesia are: BaricityQ, Position of patient - during & immediately after injection,Q drug dose & site of injection. Thus with a head down position a hyperbaric solution spreads cephald & hypobaric solution moves caudad and vice versa. And in this Q baricity of LA & time passed after injecting spinal anesthesia is not mentioned, so lowering the head end is weakest option."

The onset of headache is usually 12-72 hours following the procedure, however, it may be seen almost immediately. In most cases it lasts for 7-10 days. PDPH is believed to result from leakage of CSF from a dural defect and decreased ICT. Loss of CSF at a rate faster that it can be produced causes traction on structure suppoing the brain, paicularly dura and tentorium. Traction on cranial nerve (paicularly 6th nerve) produces diplopia. Factors that increase the incidence of PDPH are young age, female sex, Pregnancy, large bore needle and multiple punctures. Use of small bore needle can prevent PDPH . Intially conservative treatment is given which includes analgesics (NSAIDs), oral or i.v., fluids, Sumatriptan, cosyntropin, caffeine and recumbent position. If conservative treatment fails, epidural blood patch can be used. It involves injecting 15-20 ml of autologus blood into the epidural space which stop leakage of CSF by coagulation and mass effect"

However, this can be reversed with the administration of antihistaminics.The increased airway resistance is due to the presence of increased levels of histamine and administration of an antihistaminic such as diphenhydramine causes the reversal of the effects of histamine.d-Tubocurarine can block even the sympathetic ganglia.Histamine release along with sympathetic blockade can result in severe hypotension."

Simple, portable \"all-in-one\" monitor of oxygenation, pulse rate and rhythm regularity, suitable for \"field\" use.2. As a safe, non-invasive monitor of the cardio-respiratory status of high-dependency patients - in the emergency department, during general and regional anaesthesia, postoperatively and in intensive care. This includes procedures such as endoscopy, where often frail patients are given sedative drugs such as midazolam. Pulse oximeters detect the presence of cyanosis more reliably than even the best doctors when using their clinical judgement.3. During the transport of patients - especially when this is noisy - for example in aircraft, helicopters or ambulances. The audible tone and alarms may not be heard, but if a waveform can be seen together with an acceptable oxygen saturation, this gives a global indication of a patient's cardio-respiratory status.4. To assess the viability of limbs after plastic and orthopaedic surgery and, for example, following vascular grafting, or where there is soft tissue swelling or aortic dissection. As a pulse oximeter requires a pulsatile signal under the sensor, it can detect whether a limb is getting a blood supply.5. As a means of reducing the frequency of blood gas analysis in intensive care patients- especially in paediatric practice where vascular (arterial) access may be more difficult.6. To limit oxygen toxicity in premature neonates' supplemental oxygen can be tapered to maintain an oxygen saturation of 90% Thus avoiding the damage to the lungs and retinas of neonates. Although pulse oximeters are calibrated for adult haemoglobin, HbA, the absorption spectra of HbA and HbF are almost identical over the range used in pulse oximetry, so the technique remains reliable in neonates.7. During thoracic anaesthesia - when one lung is being collapsed down To determine whether oxygenation via the remaining lung is adequate or whether increased concentrations of oxygen must be given.8. Fetal oximetry- a developing technique that uses reflectance oximetry, using LEDs of 735nm and 900nm. The probe is placed over the temple or cheek of the fetus, and needs to be sterile and sterilisable. They are difficult to secure and the readings are variable, for physiological and technical reasons. Hence the trend is more useful than the absolute value."

    "explanation": "Children are paicularly susceptible to profound bradycardia following administration of succinylcholine. Bradycardia will sometimes occur in adults when a second bolus of succinylcholine is administered approximately 3-8 min after the first dose. The dogma is that the succinylcholine metabolite, succinylmonocholine, sensitizes muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the sinoatrial node to the second dose of succinylcholine, resulting in bradycardia. Intravenous atropine is normally given prophylactically to children prior to the first and subsequent doses, and usually before a second dose of succinylcholine is given to adults. Succinylcholine not only stimulates nicotinic cholinergic receptors at the neuromuscular junction, it stimulates all ACh receptors. Low doses of succinylcholine can produce negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, but higher doses usually increase hea rate and contractility and elevate circulating catecholamine levels.

    ],
    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Humphry Davy coined the name \"laughing gas\" for nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas or nitrous, is a chemical compound, an oxide of nitrogen with the formula N2O. At room temperature, it is a colourless, non-flammable gas, with a slight metallic scent and taste. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidiser similar to molecular oxygen. It is soluble in water. Nitrous oxide is a weak general anaesthetic, and so is generally not used alone in general anaesthesia, but used as a carrier gas (mixed with oxygen) for more powerful general anaesthetic drugs such as sevoflurane or desflurane. It has a minimum alveolar concentration of 105% and a blood/gas paition coefficient of 0.46. The use of nitrous oxide in anaesthesia, however, can increase the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Recreational inhalation of nitrous oxide, with the purpose of causing euphoria and/or slight hallucinations, began as a phenomenon for the British upper class in 1799, known as \"laughing gas paies\". In rats, N2O stimulates the mesolimbic reward pathway by inducing dopamine release and activating dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens, presumably through antagonistic of NMDA receptors localised in the system. This action has been implicated in its euphoric effects and, notably, appears to augment its analgesic propeies as well. It is remarkable, however, that in mice, N2O blocks amphetamine-induced carrier-mediated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and behavioural sensitisation, abolishes the conditioned place preference (CPP) of cocaine and morphine, and does not produce reinforcing (or aversive) effects of its own. Effects of CPP of N2O in rats are mixed, consisting of reinforcement, aversion and no change. In contrast, it is a positive reinforcer in squirrel monkeys, and is well known as a drug of abuse in humans. These discrepancies in response to N2O may reflect species variation or methodological differences. In human clinical studies, N2O was found to produce mixed responses, similarly to rats, reflecting high subjective individual variability."

      "None"
    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Malignant hypehermia (MH) is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with reduced penetrance. It is associated with mutations in 2 genes: RyR1 (ryanodine receptor type 1), which encodes the skeletal muscle isoform of the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and CACNA1S, which encodes the alpha subunit of the L-type calcium channel isoform of the sarcolemma (dihydropyridine receptor). The RyR1 gene is located on chromosome 19. Malignant hypehermia (MH) is a subclinical myopathy that allows large quantities of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle and cause a hypermetabolic state after exposure to triggering agents. Altered calcium channel gating kinetics in the SR is the underlying cause. The sustained elevation of calcium allows excessive stimulation of aerobic and anaerobic glycolytic metabolism, which accounts for respiratory and metabolic acidosis, rigidity, altered cell permeability, and hyperkalemia."

The most frequent laser related complication is airway fire. Laser Resistant ETTs are used to prevent airway fires during laser surgery of the airway. Initially, fires are located on surface of ETT and cause thermal injury to tissues. If the fire burns through to interior of ETT, O2 and positive pressure ventilation create a blow torch effect, blowing heat and toxic products down into lung. Cuff puncture allowing O2 enriched atmosphere can also increase chance of fire after laser burst. the cuff of Laser tube is special low volume high pressure."

However, the total body clearance of propofol is greater than the generally accepted hepatic blood flow and significant extrahepatic metabolism also occur in lungs, and excreted via kidney. Metabolic clearance of propofol by the kidneys accounts for almost one-third of total body clearance and may be the major contributor to the extra-hepatic elimination of this drug.HalothaneoHalothane is an inhalational anesthetic. Most of the inhaled anesthetics are eliminated from lung, though some metabolism in liver may occur. In terms of extent of hepatic metabolism, the rank of order is methoxyflurane (>50%) > Halothane (20%)> Ether (10-15%)> enflurane (3-5%)> Sevoflurane (3%)> Isoflurane (0.2%)> desflurane (<0.1%)>N2 O(0%). N2 O does not have any metabolism in the body.oHalothane is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2E1, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2A6 LignocaineoLidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. Lignocaine clearance is reduced in patients with liver disease and appears to be a sensitive index of liver dysfunction.AtracuriumoThe unique feature of atracurium is inactivation in plasma by spontaneous non-enzymatic degradation (Hoffman elimination) in addition to that by alkaline ester hydrolysis. Consequently its duration of action is not altered in patients with hepatic/renal insufficiency or hypodynamic circulation - Preferred muscle relaxant for such patients as well as for neonates and the elderlyoThe major degradation product is laudanosine. Metabolites can be considered as pharmacologically inactive with the usual doses of atracurium. Because of spontaneous degradation of atracurium in plasma, its kinetics is theoretically independent of renal and liver functions."

    ],
    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "Securing a stable airway is one of the most fundamental and impoant aspects of the management of the severely injured patient. The level of control required will vary from a simple oropharyngeal airway to tracheostomy, depending on the clinical situation. Full control of the airway should be secured in the emergency room if the patient is unstable. Endotracheal intubation will usually be the method chosen, but the physician should be prepared to do a tracheotomy if attempts at perioral or perinasal intubation are failing or are impractical because of maxillofacial injuries. The most dangerous period is just prior to and during the initial attempts to get control of the airway. Manipulation of the oronasopharynx may provoke combative behavior or vomiting in a patient already confused by drugs, alcohol, hypoxia, or cerebral trauma. The risk of aspiration is high during these initial attempts, and the physician should make no assumptions about the state of the contents of the patient's stomach. Antacids are recommended just prior to the intubation attempt, if feasible. Although steroids have been recommended in the past, they are no longer considered of value in the management of aspiration of acidic gastric juice. The best management requires prevention of the complication of aspiration. In a reasonably cooperative patient, awake intubation with topical anesthesia may help to prevent some of the risks of hypotension, arrhythmia, and aspiration associated with the induction of anesthesia. If awake intubation is inappropriate, then an alternative is rapid-sequence induction with a thiobarbiturate followed by muscle paralysis with succinylcholine. If elevated intracranial pressure is suspected, or if a penetrating eye injury exists, awake intubation is contraindicated."

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has developed pump failure because of a combination of preexisting coronary aery occlusive disease and high preload following a fluid challenge; afterload remains moderately high as well because of systemic vasoconstriction in the presence of cardiogenic shock. Poor myocardial performance is reflected in the low cardiac output and high PCWP. Therapy must be directed at increasing cardiac output without creating too high a myocardial O2 demand on the already failing hea. Administration of nitroglycerin could be expected to reduce both preload and afterload, but, if given without an inotrope, it would create unacceptable hypotension. Nitroprusside similarly would achieve afterload reduction but would result in hypotension if not accompanied by an inotropic agent. A b-blocker would act deleteriously by reducing cardiac contractility and slowing the hea rate in a setting in which cardiac output is likely to be rate-dependent. Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that is becoming the inotropic agent of choice in cardiogenic shock. As a b1 -adrenergic agonist, it improves cardiac performance in pump failure both by positive inotropy and peripheral vasodilation. With minimal chronotropic effect, dobutamine only marginally increases myocardial O2 demand."

    "explanation": "The pathophysiology of mitral stenosis involves impaired diastolic filling of the left ventricle because of an obstruction at the level of the mitral valve. This results in a pressure gradient between the left atrium and the left ventricle. Consequently, left atrial pressure rises while the left ventricle is under-filled. As left atrial pressure increases, pulmonary venous return is impaired and pulmonary hypeension with right ventricular failure can occur."

    "question": "Which is not a complication in surgery in sitting position?",
    "options": [
      "Venous air embolism",
      "Hemorrhage",
      "Pneumocephalus",
      "Tongue edema"
    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Bleeding is less when patient is placed in this position. This position is most commonly utilized for posterior fossa surgery and cervical laminectomy. Benefits: This position provides optimal surgical exposure for posterior fossa surgery because tissue retraction and risks of cranial nerve damage are reduced, cerebral venous drainage is improved and bleeding is less. The patient's airway is accessible to the anesthesiologist. Risks: Venous air embolism (VAE), paradoxical air embolism, bradycardia or cardiac arrest due to brain stem manipulations can occur. Macroglossia, upper airway obstruction, pneumocephalus, subdural hematoma, and quadriplegia have also been repoed. Despite well described risks involved with the sitting position, there is no evidence of increased moality rate. Relative contraindications to the sitting position include: open ventriculoatrial shunt, signs of cerebral ischemia when upright and awake, right-to-left shunt as with patent foramen ovale, and cardiac instability. venous air embolism in sitting craniotomy incidence highest 20-40% Hemodynamics and Ventilation. The classic sitting position causes postural hypotension in about 1/3 of patients, and 2-5% of patients suffer severe hypotension (decrease in blood pressure more than by half from baseline). The major hemodynamic consequence is decrease in venous return, leading to decrease in cardiac output and hypotension. Therefore, hemodynamic instability and cardiac disease are relative contraindications for prone positioning. Wrapping of the legs with elastic bandages (e.g. ACE bandage) prevents pooling of blood in the lower extremities and should be applied in every case. Ventilation in sitting position is improved compared to the supine position due to downward shift of the diaphragm, which decreases intraabdominal pressure, improves ventilation of the dependent zones, and decreases ventilation-perfusion mismatch. However, low perfusion pressure secondary to decreased venous return may affect oxygenation. Therefore, preventing hypovolemia and maintaining normal pulmonary perfusion pressure are crucial for maintaining an adequate oxygen delivery in sitting position. Venous Air Embolism (VAE) The mechanisms of VAE include negative venous pressure and exposure of veins and bony venous sinuses to air. When the site of surgery is exposed to air and located above the level of the hea, air may be entrained in the veins and bony venous sinuses, and air may enter the pulmonary circulation. A large VAE may decrease cardiac output by creating an airlock and decreasing left ventricular output. The incidence of VAE in sitting position may approximate 20-50% when precordial Doppler monitoring is used for detection and 76% with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is used for detection. Patent foramen ovale should be excluded before every case as it is a source of paradoxical air embolism. Therefore, preoperative \"bubble test\" in awake patients using TEE or transthoracic echocardiography is advocated by some authors if the sitting position is considered. In addition to standard monitoring, precordial transthoracic Doppler is recommended for early detection of VAE. Although TEE is more sensitive in detecting VAE, precordial Doppler is inexpensive, readily available, easy to use, and noninvasive. Optimal placement of the precordial probe should be guided by the recognizing the highest pitch over the right upper sternal border with the intravenous injection of agitated saline. When precordial Doppler or TEE are unavailable, VAE should be considered when end tidal CO2 suddenly decreases in the presence of hypotension, not explained by other causes. An atrial catheter (multiorifice or single orifice) placed at the high level of the right atrium may be helpful for air aspiration. Correct positioning may be verified using intravenous electrocardiography, chest radiography, or TEE. However, the therapeutic value of the right atrial catheter may be limited. The most impoant treatment for VAE include irrigation of the surgical site with saline, rescue head-down tilt or left lateral positioning, and cardiovascular suppo with administration of inotropes. Other Complications The incidence of postoperative pneumocephalus in sitting position may reach 100% , and may be due to negative cerebral spinal fluid pressure and/or residual air during closure of the dura. Therefore, nitrous oxide should be discontinued 20-30 minutes before completion of the procedure. However, pneumocephalus can develop even without the use of nitrous oxide and may persist for weeks after surgery. Life-threatening tension pneumocephalus is rare (3%). Quadriplegia is a rare but devastating complication and results from cervical spine ischemia with neck and head hyperflexion. Elderly patients with cervical spine deformities and vascular pathologies have higher risk. During positioning, sufficient distance between chin and neck (at least 2 finger-breadth) is recommended to avoid neck hyperflexion."

Additionally, refeeding results in an increased cellular need for phosphorus for energy production (ATP) and glucose metabolism. Early complications of TPN also include hyperglycemia, hyperchloremic acidosis, and volume overload with resultant hea failure. TPN, paicularly in the extremely malnourished patient, should be staed slowly; magnesium, potassium, and phosphate levels should be repleted; and dextrose infusions should be limited to prevent complications of refeeding."

Preoperative laboratory results are notable for a hematocrit of 24% and urinalysis with 18 to 25 WBCs and gram-negative bacteria. On call to the operating room, the patient receives intravenous penicillin. His abdomen is shaved in the operating room. An open cholecystectomy is performed and, despite a lack of indications, the common bile duct is explored. The wound is closed primarily with a Penrose drain exiting a separate stab wound.

    "explanation": "The determinants of a postoperative wound infection include factors predetermined by the status of the patient (eg, age, obesity, steroid dependence, multiple diagnoses , immunosuppression) and by the type of procedure (eg, contaminated versus clean, emergent versus elective). However, there are several factors that can be optimized by the surgeon. Decreasing the bacterial inoculum and virulence by limiting the patient's prehospital stay, clipping the operative site in the operating room, administering perioperative antibiotics (within a 24-hour period surrounding operation) with an appropriate antimicrobial spectrum, treating remote infections, avoiding breaks in technique, using closed drainage systems (if needed at all) that exit the skin away from the surgical incision, and minimizing the duration of the operation have all been shown to decrease postoperative infection. Making a wound less orable to infection requires attention to basic Halstedian principles of hemostasis, anatomic dissection, and gentle handling of tissues as well as limiting the amount of foreign body and necrotic tissue in the wound. Although they are the most difficult factors to influence, host defense mechanisms can be improved by optimizing nutritional status, tissue perfusion, and oxygen delivery."

    "explanation": "Entropy monitoringis a method of assessing the effect of ceain anaesthetic drugs on the brain's EEG. It was commercially developed by Datex-Ohmeda, which is now pa of GE Healthcare. Entropy is a quantitative EEG device which captures a single-lead frontal EEG a 3-electrode sensor applied to the patient's forehead. The system relies on a method of assessing the degree of irregularity in electroencephalogram(EEG) signals. The principle is that the irregularity of an EEG signal decreases with increasing brain levels of anaesthetic drugs and that the entropy is a measure of that irregularity. Entropy monitors generate two numbers that are derived from different to frequency bands used. The State Entropy (SE) is calculated from the 0.8Hz to 32Hz range, whereas the Response Entropy (RE) uses frequencies up to 47Hz. Electromyogram activity is more predominant in those higher frequencies, and so the Response Entropy may respond more quickly when muscle activity is present. Published studies show that Entropy values do relate to clinical levels of anaesthetic depth. Most of the commonly-used anaesthetic drugs are detectable by Entropy monitoring, a notable exception being nitrous oxide, in common with BIS monitoring. Other vital signs such as pulse, hea rate, blood pressure, and movement are indirect indicators of consciousness, but are unreliable. When these are combined with expired gas analysis of inhalational anaesthetic agents, an experienced anaesthetist can be confident a patient is unconscious and not aware of their surroundings."

The oxygen content of the FRC filled with air is 21% i.e., at the end of the expiration oxygen content is 21 % in the air of lung. Normal FRC is 2.5 litres, therefore oxygen content is 500 ml (21% of 2.5 litres). Most of the remaining gas is nitrogen. This oxygen content will last only for 2 minutes (oxygen consumption is 250 ml/min).* By pre-oxygenation, we washout nitrogen (denitrogenation) with 100% O2 - O2 content of FRC is 2.5 litres (100%) - Lasts for 8 to 10 minutes.* Pre oxygenation is done for 3 minutes because 99% of denitrogenation (nitrogen wash out) takes place in 3 minutes."

The coefficient is defined as the ratio of the concentration in blood to the concentration in gas that is in contact with that blood when the paial pressure in both compaments is equal. Newer anesthetics (such as desflurane) typically have smaller blood-gas paition coefficients than older ones (such as ether); these are preferred because they lead to faster onset of anesthesia and faster emergence from anesthesia once application of the anesthetic is stopped. If an anesthetic has a high coefficient, then a large amount of it will have to be taken up in the body's blood before being passed on to the fatty (lipid) tissues of the brain where it can exe its effect.

Ann Fr Anesth Reanim. 1988; 7(3):204-10Explanation:Bupivacaine is the most cardiotoxic of all the local anaesthetics.Associated with sudden increase in the plasma concentration of bupivacaine.It involves both electrical and mechanical structures within the heart.The main site of action on cardiac conduction tissue is the Vmax of phase 0 of the action potential of fast-reacting structures tlNa current).Bupivacaine, like lidocaine and the other class I antiarrhythmic drugs, blocks the sodium channels, this block being more slowly reversible.The disturbance of sodium channels throughout the heart leads to a decreased conduction speed throughout the conduction system, thus explaining possible acute conduction disturbances originating below the bundle of His.The ventricular dysarrhythmias are due to a re-entry circuit secondary to a slowing in conduction speed.The sinus bradycardias and junctional disturbances seen in toxic accidents are probably due to an inhibition of the slow current of the atrial and atrio-ventricular nodes (Isi current!.Bupivacaine, at toxic levels, has a direct effect on contractility.The negative inotropic effects seem to be due to a fall in the intracytoplasmic calcium concentration on wrhich depends the excitation- contraction couple, as well as disturbed cellular energetic events dependent on the contraction.Bupivacaine is disproportionately more cardiotoxic than its shorter-acting counterparts like ropivacaine and levobupivacaine.While all local anaesthetics can cause direct negative inotropic effects, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine are less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine."

Primary cause of VAE is surgical procedures, especially neurosurgical procedures performed in the upright, sitting position. Anytime the operative site is more than 5 cm above the right atrium, VAE is a risk. Other surgical procedures that can lead to the infusion of air include obstetric/gynecologic procedures (cesarean section), craniofacial surgery, dental implant surgery, vascular procedures, liver transplantation, and orthopedic procedures (e.g., hip replacement, arthroscopy). The frequency of reported VAE in surgical procedures ranges from 10% in cervical laminectomy up to 80% in posterior fossa surgery.2. Second cause of VAE is iatrogenic creation of a pressure gradient for air entry. Examples include spinal needles in lumbar punctures (case report), peripheral intravenous lines, central venous catheters, pulmonary artery catheters, hemodialysis catheters, and long-term (Hickman) catheters. Most cases occur during catheter manipulation, disconnection, or removal. A pressure difference of 5 cm of H2O across a 14-gauge needle allows 100 ml of air per second to enter the venous system. The frequency of reported VAE with central catheter use ranges from 1 in 47 to 1 in 3000.3. A third cause of VAE is mechanical insufflation or infusion. Insufflation has been documented to occur during arthroscopic procedures, CO2 hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, urethral insufflation, and orogenital sexual activity during pregnancy. Infusion air entry can occur during the injection of contrast agents for CT scans, angiography, and cardiac catheterization, and during cardiac ablation procedures.4. A fourth cause of VAE is positive-pressure ventilation, which can occur during mechanical ventilation and SCUBA diving.5. Finally, blunt and penetrating trauma to the chest, abdomen, neck, and face can lead to the entry of air and ultimately to VAE"

    "explanation": "Ketamine is a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant. When it is given to patients with reactive airway disease and bronchospasm, pulmonary compliance is improved. Ketamine is as effective as halothane or enflurane in preventing experimentally induced bronchospasm. The mechanism for this effect is probably a result of the sympathomimetic response to ketamine, but isolated bronchial smooth muscle studies showed that ketamine can directly antagonize the spasmogenic effects of carbachol and histamine. Because of its broncho-dilating effect, the administration of ketamine can treat status asthmaticus unresponsive to conventional therapy. A potential respiratory problem, especially in children, is the increased salivation that follows ketamine administration; this effect can be modulated by an anticholinergic drug such as atropine or glycopyrrolate. Racemic ketamine is a potent bronchodilator, making it a good induction agent for asthmatic patients; however, S(+) ketamine produces minimal bronchodilation.

      "All of the above"
    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Cocaine inhibits the neuronal membrane transpoers for catecholamines, thereby potentiating the effect of NE at adrenergic receptors in the vasculature, resulting in vasoconstriction and reduced cocaine absorption in vascular beds where adrenergic effects predominate. Ropivacaine and bupivacaine also cause vasoconstriction. Cocaine is used only in the nose, nasopharynx, mouth, throat, and ear, where it uniquely produces vasoconstriction as well as anesthesia. The shrinking of mucous membranes decreases operative bleeding while improving surgical visualization. Comparable vasoconstriction can be achieved with other local anesthetics by the addition of a low concentration of a vasoconstrictor such as phenylephrine (0.005%). Ref: Catterall W.A., Mackie K.

      "Droperidol"
    ],
    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Opioids can increase muscle tone and may cause muscle rigidity. The incidence of rigidity noted with opioid anesthetic techniques varies significantly because of differences in dose and speed of opioid administration, the concomitant use of N2O, the presence or absence of muscle relaxants, and the patient's age. Opioid-induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone that sometimes progresses to severe stiffness with the potential for serious problems. Clinically significant opioid-induced rigidity usually begins just as or after a patient loses consciousness. Mild manifestations of rigidity, such as hoarseness, can occur in conscious patients. Vocal cord closure is primarily responsible for the difficult ventilation with a bag and mask that follows the administration of opioids. The precise mechanism by which opioids cause muscle rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not the result of a direct action on muscle fibers because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. Mechanisms of opioid-induced muscle rigidity involving the CNS have been postulated. Pharmacologic investigation using selective agonists and antagonists suggest that systemic opioid-induced muscle rigidity is primarily caused by activation of central m receptors, whereas supraspinal d1 and k1 receptors may attenuate this effect. Some aspects of opioid-induced catatonia and rigidity (increased incidence with age, muscle movements resembling extrapyramidal side effects) are similar to Parkinson's disease and suggest similarities in neurochemical mechanisms. Patients with Parkinson's disease, paicularly if they are inadequately treated, may experience reactions such as dystonia following opioid administration. Pretreatment with or concomitant use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can decrease the incidence and severity of rigidity. Induction doses of sodium thiopental and subanesthetic doses of diazepam and midazolam can prevent, attenuate, or successfully treat rigidity. Rapid administration of larger doses of opioids (paicularly fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, and alfentanil) can induce chest wall rigidity severe enough to make ventilation with bag and mask nearly impossible.

Dilation of cutaneous blood vessels is often the first sign of local anesthetic onset. C fibers and A-d are next-in sensitivity. They result in the inability to feel cool sensations such as an alcohol wipe. Next-in sensitivity are the A-g, A-b, and A-a fibers, which result in the loss of sensation, pressure, proprioception, and finally motor paralysis. Local anesthetic concentration must be adequate to block nerve fibers. It takes approximately twice the concentration of local anesthetic to block motor fibers as it does to block sensory fibers, and sympathetic fibers require the least.

    "explanation": "Anesthetic drugs that trigger Malignant Hypehermia include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, anddepolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used. Mild hypothermia and the preadministration of barbiturates, tranquilizers, propofol, or nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers delay or prevent the onset of MH The two classic clinical manifestations of fulminant MH syndrome may sta with one of the following two scenarios:1. Rigidity after induction with succinylcholine but successful intubation, followed rapidly by the symptomslisted after scenario 22. Normal response to induction of anesthesia and uneventful anesthetic course until the onset of the following symptoms:* Unexplained sinus tachycardia or ventricular arrhythmias (or both)* Tachypnea, if spontaneous ventilation is present* Unexplained decrease in oxygen (O2) saturation (because of a decrease in venous O2 saturation)* Increase in end-tidal paial pressure of CO2 (Pco2) with adequate ventilation and, in most cases, unchanged ventilation* Unexpected metabolic and respiratory acidosis* Central venous desaturation* Increase in body temperature above 38.8deg C with no obvious cause. TREATMENTAcute management for MH can be summarized as follows:1. Discontinue all anesthetic agents and hyperventilate with 100% O2 with a fresh flow to at least 10 L/min. With increased aerobic metabolism, normal ventilation must increase. However, CO2 production is also increased because of neutralization of fixed acid by bicarbonate; hyperventilation removes this additional CO2.2. Reconstitute dantrolene in sterile water (not saline), and administer rapidly (2.5 mg/kg intravenously to a total dose of 10 mg/kg IV) every 5 to 10 minutes until the initial symptoms subside.3. Administer bicarbonate (1 to 4 mEq/kg IV) to correct the metabolic acidosis with frequent monitoring of blood gases and pH.4. Control fever by administering iced fluids, cooling the body surface, cooling body cavities with sterile iced fluids, and, if necessary, using a heat exchanger with a pump oxygenator. Cooling should be halted when the temperature approaches 38deg C to prevent inadveent hypothermia.5. Monitor urinary output, and establish diuresis if urine output is inadequate. Administer bicarbonate to alkalinize urine to protect the kidney from myoglobinuria induced renal failure.6. Blood gases, electrolytes, CK, temperature, arrhythmia, muscle tone, and urinary output guide fuher therapy. Hyperkalemia should be treated with bicarbonate, glucose, and insulin. Effective doses of dantrolene to reverse MH are the most effective way to lower serum potassium levels. In severe cases, calcium chloride or calcium gluconate may be used.7. Analyze coagulation studies (e.g., international normalized ratio , platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, fibrin split degradation products). Safe anesthetics consist of nitrous oxide, barbiturates, etomidate, propofol, opiates, tranquilizers, and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. Volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine must be avoided at all times, even in the presence of dantrolene. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e"

It result from decreased intracranial pressure as CSF leaks from dural defect at a greater rate than it is being produced.Q The headache is BIL, frontal Or retro-orbital, occipital & extending into neck. It may be throbbing & associated with photophobia & nausea. The onset is usually 12-72 hoursQ following procedure (in first 3 days) may last for 1-2 weeksQ. The hallmark is its association with body positionQ (i.e. aggravated by sitting or standing & relieved by lying down)0 The incidence increases with ? 1. Larger needleQ 2. Cutting point (in comparision to pencil point) needle. 3. Young age, Female sex, PregnancyQ So, max incidence is expected in a wet epidural tap with a large epidural needle in an obstetric patient. Lowest incidence would be expected with an elderly male using 27 gauge pencil point needle. Management of PDPH Prevention by thinner needleQ (whitacre needle) Supine position, intravenous fluids & caffeine and analgesia. Epidural blood Patch is most effective treatment."

    "explanation": "Caudal anesthesia is popular in pediatric anesthesia and is paicularly useful when sacral anesthetic spread is desired (e.g., perineal, anal, rectal procedures). Caudal anesthesia requires identification of the sacral hiatus. The sacrococcygeal ligament (i.e., extension of ligamentum flavum) overlies the sacral hiatus between the two sacral cornua. To facilitate locating the cornua, the posterior superior iliac spines should be located and, by using the line between them as one side of an equilateral triangle, the location of the sacral hiatus should be approximated. After the sacral hiatus is identified, the index and mid-dle fingers of the palpating hand are placed on the sacral cornua, and after local infiltration, the caudal needle (or Tuohy needle if a catheter is to be placed) is inseed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to the sacrum. While the needle is advanced, a decrease in resistance to needle inseion should be appreciated as the needle enters the caudal canal. The needle is then redirected so that the angle of inseion relative to the skin surface is decreased."

Several types of anaesthesia are available, including numbing cream or injecting a small amounts of anaesthetic around the penis. These are generally considered safe.\nSome text books (like S. Das operative surgery and Lee's have) different opinion. According to them neonatal circumcision should be done in general anaesthesia. But following statement will clear all doubts :-\n\n\"Local anaesthesia is all that is required for circumcision in neonate. General anaesthetics present unnecessary risks, including neurotoxicity that may affect the development of neuronal structures in brain.

Inject 2-3 ml more lidocaine into the subcutaneous tissue. Insert the needle or introducer in the midline at 90 degrees to the skin.Feedback from the needle tip will monitor the progress of the needle through the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, the ligamentum flavum and sometimes the dura mater. If bone is contacted, withdraw the needle to the subcutaneous tissue and redirect slightly cephalad in the first instance.Puncture of the dura is usually obvious, and when the stylet is removed CSF should flow freely."

    ],
    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient's elevated aPTT, normal PT, and abnormal bleeding time are consistent with her von Willebrand disease (vWD). von Willebrand factor (vWF) is an impoant stimulus for platelet aggregation at the site of tissue injury and a major carrier protein for circulating factor VIII. There are three major groups of vWD. Type I, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, has decreased levels of vWF. Type II is variably inherited and has qualitative defects in vWF. Type III is an autosomal recessive severe bleeding disorder with absent levels of vWF. Patients with vWD present with mucosal bleeding, petechiae, epistaxis, and menorrhagia. vWD produces a depressed ristocetin cofactor assay (which measures the effectiveness of vWF in agglutinating platelets when stimulated with the antibiotic ristocetin). These patients do not generally require treatment unless they need surgery or are severely injured. DDAVP, a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, activates receptors that result in release of vWF from storage sites and causes shoening in the bleeding time in patients with type I vWD and some patients with type II vWD. vWF prevents inactivation of factor VIII; administration of DDAVP results in normalization of factor VIII activities. Transfusion of cryoprecipitate provides vWF, whereas infusions of high-purity concentrates of factor VIII:C are not effective because of the lack of vWF. Vitamin K is used perioperatively to reverse coagulopathy due to warfarin or liver disease and is not indicated in this scenario. Aminocaproic acid inhibits fibrinolysis and is not indicated for treating vWD."

It has been studied and validated in both deeply sedated and moderately sedated patients. The CPOT assesses four areas (facial expression, movements, muscle tension and ventilator compliance). Each area is scored from 0-2, with total scores ranging from 0 (no pain) to 8 (most pain). It is validated in both intubated and non-intubated critical care patients. CPOT has superior reliability and validity when used in non-verbal critically ill adults. Chronic pain or delirium may make asceaining a pain level difficult with CPOT.

    "explanation": "Ans is 'b' i.e. Crystalloids * Crystalloid solutions seem to be the most appropriate type of fluids for initial resuscitation of septic shock patients & have been recommended as a first choice to resuscitate septic shock patientsFluid resuscitation in septic shock* The landmark of septic shock is systemic vasodilation, with different levels of hypovolemia. Fluid administration is the first-line intervention to restore the systemic hemodynamics and increase oxygen delivery to match oxygen demand in septic patients.* Fluid resuscitation is initiated to achieve a CVP of 8 to 12 mmHg* According to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, septic patients presenting tissue hypoperfusion, hypotension or signs of hypovolemia and admitted to the emergency department must receive an initial fluid load with 30mL/kg of body weight of crystalloids.* Crystalloid refers to solutions containing water, inorganic ions and small organic molecules. Crystalloids are composed of glucose or sodium chloride solutions, and can be hypotonic, isotonic or hypertonic* They supply water and electrolytes to maintain osmotic gradient between extravascular and intravascular compartments as they contain fluids and electrolytes that are normally found in the body.* Colloids have larger molecular-weight particles that give them oncotic plasma pressures similar to natural plasma proteins. This theoretically allows for better volume resuscitation by remaining in the intravascular space and supporting circulating volume as compared to crystalloids, which may have extravascular shift causing pulmonary and interstitial edema. However, in patients with increased vascular permeability as seen in sepsis and late hemorrhagic shock, leakage of these larger colloid molecules also exist.* Hypo-oncotic albumin solutions can be used as an alternative for those who need large amounts of fluids during the initial resuscitation phase.* Hydroxyethyl starches solutions must be avoided in septic patients due to the increased risk of acute renal failure, increased need for renal replacement therapy and increased mortality."

Over the first 48 hours, he is determined to have 6 Ranson's criteria, including a PaO2 less than 60 mm Hg. His chest x-ray reveals bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and his wedge pressure is low.

    ],
    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Adult respiratory distress syndrome has been called \"shock lung\" or \"traumatic wet lung\" and occurs under a variety of circumstances. The diagnosis can be made based on bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, a PaO2 /FiO2 ratio of less than 200, and pulmonary wedge pressures of less than 18 mm Hg (low filling pressures exclude the diagnosis of pulmonary edema). Three major physiologic alterations include (1) hypoxemia usually unresponsive to elevations of inspired O2 concentration; (2) decreased pulmonary compliance, as the lungs become progressively stiffer and harder to ventilate; and (3) decreased functional residual capacity. Progressive alveolar collapse occurs owing to leakage of protein-rich fluid into the interstitium and the alveolar spaces with the subsequent radiologic picture of diffuse fluffy infiltrates bilaterally. Ventilatory abnormalities develop that result in shunt formation, decreased resting lung volume, and increased dead-space ventilation."

As volume and flow are inextricably linked, the volume control modes are generally constant flow modes, i.e. the ventilator delivers flow which is constant, and stops this flow when the desired volume is achieved.

    "explanation": "Ans. D. Mapleson E. (Ref. Paul's Clinical Anesthesia/Pg. 671)The Mapleson E is a modification of Ayre's T-piece, which was developed in 1937 by Phillip Avre for use in paediatric patients undergoing cleft palate repair or intracranial surgery.ConstructionA three-way T-tube whose limbs are connected to (F) the fresh gas supply from the anaesthesia machine, (R) a length of corrugated reservoir tube and (P) the patient connector. It has minimal dead space, no valves and minimal resistance.Function:Inspiration - The patient inspires fresh gas from the reservoir tube.Expiration - The patient expires into the reservoir tube. Although fresh gas is still flowing into the system at this time, it is wasted, as it is contaminated by expired gas. An expiratory limb volume greater than the patient's tidal volume prevents entrainment of room air (which would dilute anaesthetic gases and oxygen).Expiratory pause - Fresh gas washes the expired gas out of the reservoir tube, filling it with fresh gas for the next inspiration.A fresh gas flow greater than three times the minute ventilation prevents rebreathing.Spontaneous ventilationThe fresh gas and exhaled gas flow down the expiratory limb. Peak expiratory flow occurs early in exhalation. Thus, the proportion of fresh gas added to the exhaled gases increases. During the next breath, fresh gas is drawn from the fresh gas inlet and the expiratory limb.The original analysis of the Mapleson E system suggested that a gas flow rate of 2.5 to 3 times the minute volume was required to prevent rebreathing of expired gas. However, this assumed a square-wave respiratory pattern, and investigations using a more realistic breathing pattern have suggested that 1.5-2 times the minute volume is acceptable in spontaneously breathing patients:Body weight (kg)Fresh gas flow (L/min)51.4-1.8102.4-3.2204.1-5.4407.2-9.6Controlled ventilationIn contrast to Mapleson A systems, Mapleson D and E circuits are more efficient during controlled than spontaneous ventilation. This is because the tidal volume must be supplied during the expiratory pause. With the almost sinusoidal respiratory pattern of spontaneous respiration, there is relatively little time for this volume to be supplied, so the fresh gas flow rate must be high. The pattern of controlled ventilation, however, is usually one of a rapid inspiration, expiration and a relatively prolonged expiratory pause. This long expiratory pause gives ample time for the tidal volume requirement to be supplied, even with a fairly low fresh gas flow rate. Consequently, during controlled ventilation, the recommended fresh gas flow rate is similar to that of the Mapleson A systems during spontaneous ventilation.Intermittent positive pressure ventilation may be performed by intermittently occluding the end of the reservoir tube."

    "explanation": "Continuous lumbar epidural analgesia is the most versatile and most commonly employed technique because it gives good analgesia in both the stages of labour. It is safe on mother and fetus. Continuous lumbar epidural analgesiais the most commonly used technique to produce labor analgesia as it can provide analgesia during the first stage of labor and also provide anesthesia for vaginal delivery or for cesarean section if necessary. For adequate pain relief, the sensory block ofT10-L1is required during thefirst stageof labor andS2-S4 (Pudendal nerve block) is required during thesecond stage. The Epidural catheter placed at L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace sufficiently provides T10-S5 neural blockade. other techniques are used when we cannot give lumbar epidural."

    "explanation": "Methaemoglobinaemia is caused by prilocaine and benzocaine Prilocaine is the only local anesthetic that is metabolized to o -toluidine, which conves hemoglobin to methemoglobin producing methemoglobinemia. This is usually significant with doses of prilocaine as large as 600mg. Benzocaine used in topical local anesthetic sprays can also cause dangerous Methemoglobinemia. Treatment of medically impoant methemoglobinemia includes intravenous methylene blue (1-2 mg/kg of a 1% solution over 5 min). Methylene blue acts by reducing methemoglobin (Fe 3+ ) to hemoglobin (Fe 2+ )."

    "explanation": "Gantacurium was the first compound of this new class of neuromuscular blocking drugs, the asymmetric mixed-onium chlorofumarates. Gantacurium is an asymmetric enantiomeric isoquinolinium diester of chlorofumaric acid . Gantacurium, like cisatracurium, is a single isomer as atracurium and mivacurium are consisting of a mixture of isomers . Gantacurium is an ultra-sho acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug with a rapid onset and a wide safety margin . As cisatracurium and atracurium are inactivated by Hofmann elimination, gantacurium is metabolized by chemical degradation which involves cysteine adduction (fast process) and pH-sensitive hydrolysis (slow process) . Cysteine adduction results in replacement of chlorine by cysteine whereafter a heterocyclic ring is formed which cannot longer interact with the postjunctional acetylcholine receptor. Therefore, the metabolites of gantacurium showed no neuromuscular propeies . Moreover, there is no renal and hepatic involvement in the elimination of gantacurium . Reversal of a gantacurium-induced neuromuscular block is possible with administration of cysteine . This first drug in class showed promising results in animal and human studies which will be discussed."

The patient breathes a fixed concentration of oxygen enriched air because the gas flow is greater than the peak inspiratory flow rate of the patient. Thus there is minimal dilution from atmospheric air. The high gas flow flushes expired gas from the mask preventing rebreathing. Nasal cannula isused when a low-flow of oxygen is indicated. These do not increase dead space. Inspiratory oxygen concentration depends on the flow rate. No rebreathing occurs. Non-rebreathing mask has a one way valve prevents the exhaled air from entering the reservoir bag. It provides the patient with enriched oxygen during inhalations. Nasal masks are effective interfaces for non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in most pediatric patients. It allows better removal of CO2."

    ],
    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "A ruptured abdominal aneurysm is a surgical emergency often accompanied by serious hypotension and vascular collapse before surgery and massive fluid shifts with renal failure after surgery. In this case, all the hemodynamic parameters indicate inadequate intravascular volume, and the patient is therefore suffering from hypovolemic shock. The low urine output indicates poor renal perfusion, while the high urine-specific gravity indicates adequate renal function with compensatory free-water conservation. The administration of a vasopressor agent would ceainly raise the blood pressure, but it would do so by increasing peripheral vascular resistance and thereby fuher decrease tissue perfusion. The deleterious effects of shock would be increased. A vasodilating agent to lower the systemic vascular resistance would lead to profound hypotension and possibly complete vascular collapse because of pooling of an already depleted vascular volume. This patient's blood pressure is critically dependent on an elevated systemic vascular resistance. A diuretic would exacerbate the patient's existing volume depletion. To properly treat this patient, rapid fluid infusion and expansion of the intravascular volume must be undeaken. This can be easily done with lactated Ringer solution or blood (or both) until improvements in such parameters as the PCWP, urine output, and blood pressure are noted."

    "explanation": "Resistance impedes airflow into (and out of) the lung. The major component of resistance is the resistance exeed by the airways (large and small), and a minor component is the sliding of the lung and the chest wall tissue elements during inspiration (and expiration). Resistance is overcome by (driving) pressure. In spontaneous breathing, Resistance (R) is calculated as driving pressure (DP) divided by the resultant gas flow (F): R = DP/F The value of airway resistance is approximately 1 cm H2O/L/sec, and is higher in obstructive lung disease (e.g., COPD, asthma); in severe asthma, it is elevated approximately tenfold. The presence of an endotracheal tube adds a resistance of 5 (or 8) cm H2O/L/min for a tube with an internal diameter of size 8 (or 7) cm. For any tube for which the airflow is laminar (smooth, streamlined), the resistance increases in direct propoion to the tube length and increases dramatically (to the fouh power) as the diameter of the tube is reduced. Two factors explain why most (approximately 80%) of the impedance to gas flow occurs in the large airways. First, as bronchi progressively branch, the resistances are arranged in parallel and the total cross-sectional area at the level of the terminal bronchioles adds up to almost tenfold that at the trachea. Second, in tubes that are large, irregular or branched, the flow is often turbulent, not laminar. When flow is laminar: F(lam) = DP/R In contrast, when the flow is turbulent: F(turb) = DP/R2 Therefore, for a given radius, far more pressure is required to achieve comparable flow where the flow is turbulent; thus, the effo required is greater, and if prolonged or severe, respiratory failure is more likely.

    "explanation": "PROPOFOL The active ingredient in propofol, 2,6-diisopropylphenol, is essentially insoluble in aqueous solutions and is formulated only for IV administration as a 1% (10 mg/ml) emulsion in 10% soybean oil, 2.25% glycerol, and 1.2% purified egg phosphatide. In the United States, disodium EDTA (0.05 mg/ml) or sodium metabisulfite (0.25 mg/ml) is added to inhibit bacterial growth. The induction dose of propofol in a healthy adult is 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg and it has an onset and duration of anesthesia similar to thiopental. As with barbiturates, dosages should be reduced in the elderly and in the presence of other sedatives and increased in young children. Because of its reasonably sho elimination half-life, propofol often is used for maintenance of anesthesia as well as for induction. For sho procedures, small boluses (10% to 50% of the induction dose) every 5 minutes or as needed are effective. An infusion of propofol produces a more stable drug level (100 to 300 mg/kg per minute) and is better suited for longer-term anesthetic maintenance. Infusion rates should be tailored to patient response and the levels of other hypnotics. Sedating doses of propofol are 20% to 50% of those required for general anesthesia. However, even at these lower doses, caregivers should be vigilant and prepared for all of the side effects of propofol discussed below, paicularly airway obstruction and apnea. Propofol elicits pain on injection that can be reduced with lidocaine and the use of larger arm and antecubital veins. Excitatory phenomena during induction with propofol occur at about the same frequency as with thiopental, but much less frequently than with methohexital. Side Effects: Nervous System: The CNS effects of propofol are similar to those of barbiturates. Propofol decreases CMRO2, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial and intraocular pressures by about the same amount as thiopental. Like thiopental, propofol has been used in patients at risk for cerebral ischemia; however, no human outcome studies have been performed to determine its efficacy as a neuroprotectant. Results from studies on the anticonvulsant effects of propofol have been mixed; some data even suggest it has proconvulsant activity when combined with other drugs. Thus, unlike thiopental, propofol is not a proven acute intervention for seizures. Cardiovascular. Propofol produces a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure that is significantly greater than that produced by thiopental. The fall in blood pressure can be explained by both vasodilation and mild depression of myocardial contractility. Propofol appears to blunt the baroreceptor reflex or is directly vagotonic because smaller increases in hea rate are seen for any given drop in blood pressure after doses of propofol. As with thiopental, propofol should be used with caution in patients at risk for or intolerant of decreases in blood pressure. Respiratory and Other Side Effects: At equipotent doses, propofol produces a slightly greater degree of respiratory depression than thiopental. Patients given propofol should be monitored to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Propofol appears to be less likely than barbiturates to provoke bronchospasm. It has no clinically significant effects on hepatic, renal, or endocrine organ systems. Unlike thiopental, propofol appears to have significant anti-emetic action and is a good choice for sedation or anesthesia of patients at high risk for nausea and vomiting. Propofol provokes anaphylactoid reactions and histamine release at about the same low frequency as thiopental. Although propofol does cross placental membranes, it is considered safe for use in pregnant women, and like thiopental, only transiently depresses activity in the newborn."

An infusion of propofol produces a more stable drug level (100 to 300 mg/kg per minute) and is better suited for longer-term anesthetic maintenance. Propofol elicits pain on injection.Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism# Propofol's shorter duration after infusion can be explained by its very high clearance, coupled with the slow diffusion of drug from the peripheral to the central compartment. The rapid clearance of propofol explains its less severe hangover compared with barbiturates, and may allow for a more rapid discharge from the recovery room. Propofol is metabolized in the liver to less active metabolites that are renally excreted; however, its clearance exceeds hepatic blood flow, and an hepatic metabolism has been demonstrated. Propofol is highly protein bound, and its pharmacokinetics, like those of the barbiturates, may be affected by conditions that alter serum protein levels.Side Effects# Nervous System. The CNS effects of propofol are similar to those of barbiturates. Propofol decreases CMRO:, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial and intraocular pressures by about the same amount as thiopental.

Epinephrine is used along with local anesthetics at a concentration of 5 mg/mL or 1:200,000. At this dose, epinephrine provides adequate vasoconstriction. It is added to local anesthetics to limit systemic absorption and the systemic side effects. It limits the diffusion of the drug away from the site thereby prolongs the duration of block and improves the depth of anesthesia. Epinephrine is also used to detect accidental intraaerial injection of a local anesthetic during the neuraxial block. The classic test dose combines local anesthetic and epinephrine, 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine. This epinephrine if injected intraaerially would increase the hea rate by 20% with or without the rise in blood pressure. Use of epinephrine can also enhance analgesia by acting on spinal a2 adrenergic receptors. The extent to which epinephrine prolongs the duration of anesthesia depends on the specific local anesthetic used and the site of injection. It can prolong the block caused by shoer acting agents as compared to longer acting ones. i.e. by adding epinephrine to lidocaine, the duration of the block is prolonged significantly than by the addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine."

    "explanation": "The spinal canal contains the spinal cord with its covering (the meninges), fatty tissue and venous plexus. The meninges are composed of three layers: the pia mater, the arachnoid mater and the Dura meter. The spinal subdural space is poorly demarcated. The epidural space is a better defined potential space within the spinal canal that is bounded by the Dura meter and ligamentum flavum. There is cerebrospinal fluid between pia meter and Archnoid meter and this space is called sub arachnoid space. The spinal cord normally extends from the foramen magnum to the level of L1 in adults. so in adults we can give spinal anesthesia below this level in L2/L3, L3/L4. L2/L3 IS BETTER SPACE In children the spinal cord ends at L3 and moves up with age. The blood supply to the spinal cord and nerve roots is derived from a single anterior spinal aery and pair posterior aeries."

    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "B i.e. Carbon monoxide shift 02-Hb dissociation curve to right Smoking increases airway irritability & secretions, decreases surfactant mucopulmonary transpo and increases the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. - Cessation of smoking for 12 to 24 hrs before operation decreases the level of carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin, which shift oxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the rightQ and increases the 02 available to tissue. (CO shift oxyHb dissociation curve to left). - Improvement in mucociliary transpo and small airway function and decrease in sputum production require prolonged abstinence (8-12 weeks) from smoking. So the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications decrease with abstinence from cigarette smoking for > 8 weeks in patients undergoing cardiac (coronary aery bypass) surgery and > 4 weeks in patients underging pulmonary surgery. - Smoking sholy before surgery may be a/w an increased incidence ST segment depression on ECG. Major action of nicotine consists initially of transient stimulation (at small doses) and subsequently of a more persistent depression of all autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) ganglia (at larger doses). Nicotine also possess a biphasic action on adrenal medulla i.e. small doses evoke whereas larger doses prevent the discharge of catecholamines in response to splanchnic nerve stimulation. The effect of nicotine on neuromuscular junction are similar to those on ganglia i.e. initial stimulant phase (contractions) f/b blockade by receptor desensitization (IA rapidly developing paralysis). Nicotine, like Ach, stimulates number of sensory receptors such as mechanoreceptors (to stretch or pressure) of skin, mesentry, tongue, lung and stomach; chemoreceptors of carotid and aoic body, thermal receptors of skin and tongue; pain receptors; and emetic chemorecepto trigger zone (CTZ) in the area postrema of medulle oblongata (causing vomiting). Nicotine markedly stimulates CNS i.e. weak analgesia at low doses; tremors and convulsion at higher doses followed by CNS depression and death from respiratory failure. So it can be assumed for the above description that smoking (low nicotine) can stimulate aoic and carotid body, increase sympathetic tone and stimulate NMJ thereby increasing the muscle relaxant dose requirements."

This approach is not used routinely due to close proximity of vital structures. Ulnar nerve is usually spared by this approach because injection is given in close proximity of upper nerve roots and inferior nerve roots (C8-T1) may be spared.This technique provides excellent anaesthesia and analgesia for shoulder and upper arm procedures, (in contrast to other three approaches which do not provide adequate shoulder anaesthesia).Complications include Homer syndrome (due to stellate ganglion block), phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection into carotids and epidural or intrathecal injections.Supraclavicular approachThis is the most commonly used approach. It involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity to the trunks of the brachial plexus by inserting the needle lateral to subclavian vessels. The supraclavicular block is performed where the brachial plexus is most compact, consequently, it produces reliable and rapid onset anaesthesia and is particularly useful in a fast paced ambulatory surgery centre.Pneumothorax is the most common complication. Other complications include phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection in subclavian artery or vein, Homer syndrome, hematoma formation.Infra-clavicular approachInfraclavicular block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of cords of the brachial plexus. The axillary nerve may be spared as this nerve exits the brachial plexus sheath proximal to the level of infraclavicular block.Axillary approachAxillary block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of terminal branches of the brachial plexus. The major disadvantage of this approach is that mucocutaneous and intercostobrachial nerves are spared. So arm surgery cannot be performed. In contrast to interscalene approach, most intense block occur in (C7-T1) ulnar dermatomes and least in C5-C6 dermatomes."

    "explanation": "Determination of CVP can be helpful in the overall hemodynamic assessment of the patient. This pressure can be affected by a variety of factors, including those of cardiac, noncardiac, and aifactual origin. Venous tone, right ventricular compliance, intrathoracic pressure, and blood volume all influence CVP. Vasoconstrictor drugs, positive-pressure ventilation (with and without PEEP), mediastinal compression, and hypervolemia all increase CVP. Acute pulmonary embolism, when clinically significant, elevates CVP by causing right ventricular overload and increased right atrial pressure. Sepsis, on the other hand, decreases CVP through both the release of vasodilatory mediators and the loss of intravascular plasma volume due to increased capillary permeability. Trends in CVP measurement are more reliable than isolated readings. CVP, along with other hemodynamic parameters, can also be useful in differentiating septic shock from other etiologies of shock; shock is inadequate tissue perfusion. Septic shock has two phases: (1) a hypodynamic phase that is characterized by hypovolemia and myocardial depression and (2) a hyperdynamic phase that follows fluid resuscitation and is characterized by a normal to increased cardiac output"

Blindness From Trachoma Can Be Stopped At Four Different points : SAFE S - Surgical correction for trichiasis. It is a simple operation that can turn out lashes which are scratching the cornea. patients can be operated on in a local dispensary or health center, or other community space if properly prepared.The surgical procedure can be performed by those who have had surgical training : eye doctors, eye nurses or eye care assistants. A - Antibiotic treatment of people with active trachoma infection. Regular detection and treatment of people with active trachoma is impoant. The recommended treatment is as follows : Wash the face and clean the eyes Apply tetracycline 1% ointment to both eyes two times daily for six weeks The ointment is sticky and may blur the vision for a few moments. This will only last a few moments. If possible, treat all the children in the family. Families and individuals can do something to protect themselves from infection by increasing the number of times a child washes his/her face. Regular face washing removes discharge so that flies are not attracted to faces. It does not require great quantities of water : one liter of water can wash up to 30 faces.

Their slow absorption into the circulation also ensures a low incidence of centrally mediated side effects, such as respiratory depression or generalized itching. When these do occur, the intravenous injection of an opiate antagonist is an effective antidote. The locally mediated analgesia is not affected.

So when N2O is discontinued after prolonged anaesthesia, due to its low blood solubility it rapidly diffuses into the alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air. This causes excess of N2O in alveoli so the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli is reduced.This results in hypoxia and it is known as diffusion hypoxiaIf the cardiac reserve is normal diffusion hypoxia is not of much significance but if cardiac reserve is low, diffusion hypoxia can be very dangerous.Prevention: -It can be prevented by continuing 100% 02 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N2ONote: Diffusion hypoxia is not significant with other anaesthetics because they are administered at very low concentrations (2 - 4%) and so they cannot dilute alveolar air by more than 1-2%"

    "explanation": ") Early goal-directed therapy should be employed for patients with septic shock or severe sepsis. The tenets of resuscitation include intubation if hypoxic, fluid resuscitation to a central venous pressure target of 8 to 12 mm Hg if not intubated and infusion of vasopressors to maintain a mean aerial pressure of 65 mm Hg. Norepinephrine and dopamine are the vasopressors of choice; epinephrine vasoconstricts peripherally as well as increases cardiac contractility and is not a first-line agent for septic shock. Inotropes such as dobutamine have been used if oxygen delivery is low, but should not be used to push delivery to supranormal levels. Fuhermore, cultures should be drawn immediately and empiric antibiotics initiated; if there is a surgical source of sepsis, then operative intervention for source control should be promptly performed after initial resuscitative effos. Recombinant-activated protein C is indicated in patients with severe sepsis with a predicted high risk of moality (ie, older age, increased severity of disease); this patient does not have evidence of end-organ dysfunction such as acute renal or respiratory failure at this time. The use of coicosteroids for septic shock is controversial, but should only be considered in the setting of shock nonresponsive to fluids and vasopressors.

CNS is paicularly vulnerable to toxicity & is the site of premonitory signs of overdose in awake patients. Coical inhibitory pathways are most susceptible resulting in excitatory motor phenomenon in initial stages of LA toxicity. Hypercapnia, respiratory & metabolic acidosis exacerbates CNS toxicityQ. Increased PaCO2 increases cerebral blood flow delivering greater dose of LA more rapidly to brain. And decreased intracellular pH ours formation of non diffusable cationic (protonated) form of LA, which is trapped within neuron. Finally plasma protein binding of LA is decreased in acidic environment resulting in increased availability of free drug for diffusion into brain. But the involvement of the peripheral nerve is characterized by parathesies, numbness, hypaesthesia, pain and neurological dysfunction. So, this patient is having peripheral nerve injury.

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "The electrocardiogram demonstrates changes that are essentially diagnostic of severe hyperkalemia. Correct treatment for the affected patient includes discontinuation of exogenous sources of potassium, administration of a source of calcium ions (which will immediately oppose the myocardial effects of potassium), and administration of sodium bicarbonate (which, by producing a mild alkalosis, will shift potassium into cells); each will temporarily reduce serum potassium concentration. Infusion of glucose and insulin would also effect a temporary transcellular shift of potassium. However, these maneuvers are only temporarily effective; definitive treatment calls for removal of potassium from the body. The sodium-potassium exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) would accomplish this removal, but over a period of hours and at the price of adding a sodium ion for each potassium ion that is removed. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is probably required for this patient, since these procedures also rectify the other consequences of acute renal failure, but they would not be the first line of therapy, given the acute need to reduce the potassium level. Both lidocaine and digoxin would be not only ineffective but contraindicated, since they would fuher depress the myocardial conduction system."

    "explanation": "A i.e. Etomidate; B i.e. Propofol Increased infection and moality in a group of patients sedated with etomidate infusion in an ICU was associated with low coisol levelsQ and is attributed to etomidate induced supression of adrenal coisal synthesisQ. Etomidate is a dose dependent but reversible inhibitor of 11 - hydroxylase in the adrenal coex and is more potent than metyrapone. This enzyme is required for both mineralocoicoid and coicosteroid production. Minor adrenocoical supressive effects (i.e. impaired response to ACTH) follow induction doses or sho infusion doses. Propofol is not recommended for sedation of critically ill pediatric patients in ICU. The drug has been associated with higher moality d/t propofol infusion syndrome. Its essential features are metabolic acidosis, multiple organ failure, hemodynamic instability, hepatomegaly, and rhabdomyolysis. Very rarely, it may occur in adults, and in patients undergoing long term propofol infusion (> 48 hours) for sedation at high doses (>5 mg/ kg/ hr)."

(C2H5 -- O -- C2H5) Ether is a potent anesthetic, produces good analgesia and marked muscle relaxation by reducing ACh output from motor nerve endings. The dose of competitive neuromuscular blockers should be reduced to about 1/3. It is highly soluble in blood. Induction is prolonged and unpleasant with struggling, breath-holding, salivation and marked respiratory secretions (atropine must be given as premedication to prevent the patient from drowning in his own secretions). Recovery is slow; postanaesthetic nausea, vomiting, and retching are marked. Respiration and BP are generally well maintained because of reflex stimulation and a high sympathetic tone. It does not sensitize the hea to Adrenaline and is not hepatotoxic. Ether is not used now in developed countries because of its unpleasant and inflammable propeies. However, it is still used in developing countries, paicularly in peripheral areas because it is--cheap, can be given by open drop method (though congestion of eye, soreness of trachea and ether burns on face can occur) without the need for any equipment, and is relatively safe even in inexperienced hands.

The onset of headache is usually 12-72 hours after the procedure, However may also present immediately. Predisposing factors includes young age (not elderly), female sex, pregnancy, large bore needle (single most important predisposing factor) and multiple punctures.\nUse of small bore needle can prevent PDPH. Initially conservative treatment is given. If conservative treatment fails epidural blood patch can be given (not as the first line treatment)."

At higher doses calcium & potassium channels are also blocked. Bupivacaine is more cardiotoxic than levobupivacaine, ropivacaine and lidocaine, paicularly in presence of acute respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, hypercapnia in pregnancy (>>) and young children. - Amiodarone and possibly bretylium should be considered as preferred alternative to lidocaine in the treatment of LA induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Vasopressors may include epinephrine, norepinephrine and vasopressinQ. IsoproterenolQ may effectively reverse some of electrophysiological abnormalities characteristic of bupivacaine toxicity. - If LA intoxication produces cardiac arrest, the ACLS (advanced cardiac life suppo) guidelines are reasonable; however, I suggest that amiodarone & vasopressin be preferredQ/substituted for lidocaine & epinephrine (ACLS prefers epinephrine) - Morgan/273. With unresponsive bupivacaine toxicity, intravenous lipid infusion (remarkable ability to effect resuscitation from overdose even after 10 min of unsuccessful conventional resuscitation) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be considered.

Total body fluid accounts for about 60% of the lower body weight in male and 50% of the lower body weight in females. Intracellular fluids accounts for 40% of total body fluids and extracellular accounts for 20% of which only 5% is intravascular. Thus volume of blood accounts for 6% to 7% of body weight and only 11-12% of total body fluid. The meager distribution of total body fluid in the vascular compament is an impoant factor in the intolerance to blood loss. Plasma vs interstitial fluid Extracellular fluid accounts for about 20% of the total body fluid, and is composed of extra vascular (interstitial) and intravascular (plasma) fluid compament Comparison of interstitial fluid and plasma volumes Plasma volume is about 25% of interstitial fluid volume. This relation is impoant for understanding volume effects of two types of fluid crystalloids and colloids. Crystalloid achieves a rapid equilibrium throughout the extracellular fluid compament thus only 25% remains intravascular 75% distribute in extracellular space. Colloids does not cross blood vessels thus remains in the intravascular space."

    "explanation": "Aschners reflex is called oculocardiac reflex. TheOculocardiac reflex, also known asAschner phenomenon, Aschner reflex, or Aschner-Dagnini reflex, is a decrease in pulse rate associated with traction applied to extraocular muscles and/or compression of the eyeball. The reflex is mediated by nerve connections between the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal cranial nerve the ciliary ganglion, and the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. Nerve fibres from the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve have also been documented. These afferents synapse with the visceral motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, located in the reticular formation of the brain stem. The efferent poion is carried by the vagus nerve from the cardiovascular centerof the medulla to the hea, of which increased stimulation leads to decreased output of the sinoatrial node. This reflex is especially sensitive in neonates and children, paicularly during strabismus correction surgery.However, this reflex may also occur with adults. Bradycardia, junctional rhythm and asystole all of which may be life-threatening,can be induced through this reflex. This reflex has been seen to occur during many pan facial trauma surgeries due to stimulation of any of the three branches of trigeminal nerve."

Normal value is 35-45 mm Hg (4% to 6%). Capnography works on the principle that infrared light is absorbed by carbon dioxide. A beam of infrared light is passed across the gas sample to fall on to a sensor. The presence of CO2 in the gas leads to a reduction in the amount of light falling on the sensor which changes the voltage in the circuit. Uses of Capnography It is the surest confirmatory sign of correct intubation in trachea. Incorrect position of tube in esophagus instead of trachea (esophageal intubation) will yield ETCO2 = 0.

Succinylcholine (Ref: Miller's Anesthesia 8/e p866; Morgan 4/e p210-215; Lee 13/e p181-191)Succinylcholine is a short acting depolarizing muscle relaxant, which causes initial fasciculations during induction. It can cause muscle soreness and post-op muscle pain.Succinylcholine (Scoline, Suxamethonium or Diacetylcholine)Suxamethonium chloride, a dicholine ester of acetyl cholineA clear, colorless aqueous solution of pH 3.0-5.0 with a shelf life of 2 yearsQStored at 4degCQSpontaneous hydrolysis occurs in alkaline or warm conditionsQ.Metabolism:Sch is the only depolarizing (non-competitive) muscle relaxantQ in clinical use.It is the only neuromuscular blocker with a rapid onset of action (30-60 seconds) and ultra short (shortest) duration of actionQ (3-5 min; typically < 10 min).Its rapid onset effect is mainly due to its low lipid solubilityQ and relatively overdose that is administered.The short duration of action is due to rapid hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesteraseQ).Dibucaine number indicates the percentage of inhibition of pseudocholinesteraseQ (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme activity by local anesthetic dibucaine and it is a measure of qualitative activity of pseudocholinesterase.The dibucaine number indicates the genetic make up of an individual with respect to butyrylcholinesterase. it does not measure the concentration of enzyme in plasma, nor does it indicate the efficiency of enzyme in hydrolysing substrate succinylcholine or mivacuriumQ.Dibucaine number is proportional to enzyme function (quality) and independent of amount of enzyme (i.e. quantity)Q.Prolonged paralysis from succinylcholine caused by atypical (abnormal) pseudochoiinesterase should be treated with continued mechanical ventilation until muscle fasciculation returns to normalQ. Anticholinesterases neostigmine and pyridostigmine are avoidedQ, as these may prolong the effect of Sch.Side Effects:Sch is a relatively safe drug but because of risk of hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrest (profound bradycardia) in children with undiagnosed myopathies, Sch is considered contraindicated in routine management of children and adolescent.Side effects of Succinylcholine include an increase in* Muscle tone (masseter spasm)Q* Muscle fasciculations (signal onset of paralysis)Q* Muscle pains or myalgia (MC complication)Q* Hyperkalemia leading to diastolic cardiac arrest refractory to CPRQ* Introcutar, intracranial, intra abdominal, intragastric pressure and opening pressure of lower esophageal sphincter (all increased)* Malignant hyperthermiaQManagement of Side-effects:Sinus bradycardias, nodal (junctional rhythms and ventricular dysrhythmiasQ occur. Children are particularly susceptible to profound bradycardia. Intravenous atropine is prophylactically, given to children prior to first dose and always before a 2nd dose.Side effects especially myalgia and fasciculation can be prevented by precurarization, self-taming with IV scoline, IV lignocaine and faster infusion.

In the presence of moisture, it corrodes aluminium, tin, lead, magnesium and alloysQ. It should be stored in a closed container away from light and heat. It is soluble in rubber, and plasticsQ commonly found in ansethetic circuits. This has obvious implications for patients with halothane sensitivity, or who are at risk for malignant hypehermia, in whom anesthetic free circuit should be used.

So, PEEP has two features : -i) Positive pressure is applied during expiration (at the end).ii) Used for mechanical ventilation2) Continuous positive Airway pressure (CPAP)# CPAP is application of positive-pressure : -i) During both inspiration and expiration.ii) In spontaneous breathingPulmonary effects of PEEP and CPAP* Positive pressure in PEEP 8c CPAP results in : -i) Re-expansion (recruitment) and stabilization of partially collapsed lung, which causes : -a) Increased FRC, tidal volume & lung compliance.b) Correction of ventilation!perfusion abnormalities - Improved oxygenation.ii) Redistribution ofextravascular lung water from interstitial space between alveoli and endothelial cells towards peri-bronchial and perihilar areas - As fluid moves away from the space between vessels & alveolar space, oxygen can diffuse more easily from alveoli into the blood - Improved arterial oxygenation.Adverse effects of PEEP/CPAP1. Pulmonary* Controlled PEEP or CPAP improve lung compliance and correct ventilation/perfusion abnormalities. However, excessive PEEP or CPAP can overdistend alveoli & bronchi which results in : -i) Increased dead space ventilationii) Reduced lung complianceiii) Increased pulmonary vascular resistance & Right ventricular afterload.iv) Barotrauma (Pneumothorax, pneumopericardium, pneumoperitonium, Subcutaneous emphysema).2. Extrapulmonary* These adverse effects are primary circulatory and are related to transmission of elevated airway pressure to the chest :-i) Decreased cardiac output (due to increased intrathoracic pressure venous return is decreased).ii) Decreased hepatic & renal blood flow (due to decreased cardiac output 8c elevated CVP)iii) Increased ADH & angiotensiniv) Decreased urinary output, GFR and free water clearance (Decrease Renal function).v) Increased ICT (due to increased CVP)."

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'd' i.e. Induction agent of choice in shock Thiopentone is a short acting barbiturate used in the induction of anaesthesia.Anaesthetic barbiturates are derivatives of Barbituric acid with an oxygen or sulfur at 2 position.The three barbiturates commonly used for clinical anaesthesia are :Sodium thiopentalThiamylalMethohexitalThiopentone is supplied as powder containing the sodium salts with 6% sodium carbonate.The addition of sodium carbonate to the powder makes it water soluble.It prevents it from precipitatingThiopentone is used for the induction of anaesthesia because it has a very rapid onset of action.The typical induction dose (3-5 mg/kg) of thiopentone produces unconsciousness in 10-30 seconds with a peak effect in 1 minutes and duration of anaesthesia of 5-8 minutes.Action of this drug terminates quickly because of rapid redistribution.Thiopentone is highly lipid soluble, therefore its redistribution is very rapid and this accounts for its short duration of action.Sulphur is added to increase the lipid solubility of thiopentone.Thiopentone is given intravenously.It produces little to no pain on injection.Venoirritation can be reduced by injection into larger non hand veins and by prior intravenous injection of lidocaine.If sometimes thiopentone inadvertently enter intraarterial circulation it causes severe inflammatory and potentially necrotic reaction.Effects on systemC.N.S.Besides producing a general anaesthesia, barbiturates reduce the cerebral metabolic rate, as measured by cerebral oxygen consumption (CMR02) in a dose dependent manner.As a consequence of the decrease in (CMR02) cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure are similarly reduced.Because it markedly lowers cerebral metabolism, thiopentone has been used as a protectant against cerebral ischemia.Thiopentone also reduces intraocular pressure.Presumably in part due to their CNS depressant activity barbiturates are effective anticonvulsants.Thiopentone in particular is a proven medication in the t/t of status epilepticus.RespiratoryThiopentone is respiratory depressants.It causes dose dependent decrease in minute ventilation and tidal volume with a smaller and inconsistent decrease in respiratory rate.Thiopentone in cardiovascular system * Thiopentone produces dose dependent decrease in blood pressure.The effect is primarily due to vasodilation, particularly venodilation and to a lesser degree to direct decrease in cardiac contractility.Hypotension can be severe in patients with impaired ability to compensate for venodilation such as those with hypovolemia, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, cardiac tamponade and b adrenergic block.* Intravenous anaesthesia of choice in shock is ketamineKetamine increases blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output.These effects are mediated due to sympathomimetic activity of ketamine.Ketamine causes inhibition of both central and peripheral catecholamine reuptake.Ketamine has direct negative inotropic and vasodilatory activity but these effects usually are overwhelmed by sympathomimetic action.Adverse effectsThiopentone has no clinically significant effect on hepatic, renal or endocrine systems.Thiopentone (Barbiturates) can induce fatal attacks of porphyria in patients with acute intermittent porphyria and are contraindicated in such patients."

This is the Meyer-Oveon hypothesis put forward in 1899-1901 by Hans Horst Meyer and Charles Ernest Oveon. MAC is inversely related to potency, i.e. high MAC equals low potency. MAC values of adult Halothane: 0.75 Sevoflurane: 2.0 Isoflurane: 1.2 Desflurane: 6.0 Enflurane: 1.7 Xenon: 70 N2O: 104 Factors affecting: MAC increases with hypehermia, hypernatremia, and redheads. MAC decreases with anemia, hypercarbia, hypoxia, hypothermia, hypotension (MAP < 40 mmHg), and pregnancy. Medications, illicit drugs, and prior substance use history have also been found to affect MAC. For example, acute use of amphetamines, cocaine, ephedrine, and chronic use of alcohol increase MAC. Whereas, administration of propofol, etomidate, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ketamine, opiates, local anesthetics, lithium, verapamil, and alpha 2-agonists (dexmedetomidine, clonidine) decrease MAC. Acute alcohol intoxication and chronic amphetamine use have also been found to decrease MAC. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e"

The consequence of decreased venous return and decreased systemic vascular resistance as a result of these procedures would be hazardous to the patientGeneral anaesthesia is the preferred technique for performing ceasarean section in a patient with coarctation of Aorta as it has the advantage ofmore rapid inductionless hypotensionbetter airway and ventilation.Here are the quoted lines from an internet site further supporting our answerUncorrected coarctation is rare in pregnancy but when present tends to be exacerbated by normal physiologic changes with fixed aortic outflow obstruction and distal hypoperfusion. These patients are at increased risk of left ventricular failure, aortic dissection and rupture, endocarditis and cerebrovascular accident. Anesthetic goals should center on maintaining normal to slightly elevated SVR and heart rate and adequate preload. Regional anesthesia is relatively contraindicated. General anesthesia is the preferred technique for cesarean section with invasive hemodynamic monitoring with post ductal intraarterial catheter, CVP or PA catheters to guide fluid administration and to assess left ventricular function and use of ephedrine and dopamine as vasopressors of choice."

It is considered to be Type I hypersensitivity reaction (immediate type) to exogenous allergens such as grass pollens. It is more common in boys and affects age group 4-20 years. More common in summer, hence the name spring catarrh looks a misnomer. Recently it is being labeled as \"Warm weather conjunctivitis\". Clinical features of spring catarrh Spring catarrh is characterized by marked itching& burning, Stringy (ropy) discharge, lacrimation, photophobia and heaviness of lids. Clinically spring catarrh is divided into three types : ? Palpebral form : - It is the most common types. The upper palpebral conjunctiva shows papillae (papillary hyperophy with their characteristic appearance : - i) Lage & flat toped Cobble stone appearance (Pavement stone appearance). These papilla heal without scarring. Bulbar form : - It is characterized by Dusky red triangular congestion of bulbar conjunctiva in palpebral area; Gelatinous thickened accumulation of tissue around the limbus; Presence of discrete whitish raised dots along the limbus (Tranta's spot).

D: Thiopentone Thiopental is an ultra-sho-acting barbiturate and has been used commonly in the induction phase of general anaesthesia Following intravenous injection the drug rapidly reaches the brain and causes unconsciousness within 15 seconds. At one minute, the drug attains a peak concentration of about 60% of the total dose in the brain. Thereafter, the drug distributes to the rest of the body and in about 15-20 minutes the concentration is low enough in the brain such that consciousness returns Thiopental is not used to maintain anaesthesia in surgical procedures because, in infusion, it displays zero-order elimination kinetics, leading to a long period before consciousness is regained. Instead, anaesthesia is usually maintained with an inhaled anesthetic (gas) agent. Inhaled anesthetics are eliminated relatively quickly, so that stopping the inhaled anesthetic will allow rapid return of consciousness."

    ],
    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Halogenated volatile anesthetics have a potentiating effect on nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. The mechanism appears to be incompletely understood, but is likely a combination of: effect on central motor neurons augmentation of the NMB's affinity for the receptor site inhibition of post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors Clinically, the presence of inhaled anesthetics will decrease the ED50, as well as both prolong the duration of action and recovery from neuromuscular blockade. The degree of potentiation depends on the specific agent and concentration used. For example, desflurane > sevoflurane > isoflurane. With deeper planes of anesthesia, the degree of potentiation is enhanced due to a dose-dependent inhibition of current through the nicotinic receptor at the neuromuscular junction. Studies attempting to quantify the magnitude of these effects have led to conflicting results due to the time factor, or duration of anesthesia. The older halogenated agents (halothane, enflurane, isoflurane) may take up to 2 hours to equilibrate with muscle, so in practice the potentiating effects of these vapors might not be immediately apparent. In contrast, newer agents such as sevoflurane and desflurane equilibrate more rapidly with muscle, and the effects may be seen after as little as 30 minutes. Nitrous oxide has largely been considered as having no effect on neuromuscular blockade."

This reduces its systemic toxicity. Must Know: The use of vasoconstrictors in local anesthetic preparations for anatomical regions with limited collateral circulation could produce irreversible hypoxic damage, tissue necrosis, and gangrene, and therefore is contraindicated.

    "explanation": "Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) refers to the administration of ventilatory suppo without using an invasive aificial airway (endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube). The use of noninvasive ventilation (see the video below) has markedly increased over the past two decades, and noninvasive ventilation has now become an integral tool in the management of both acute and chronic respiratory failure, in both the home setting and in the critical care unit. Noninvasive ventilation has been used as a replacement for invasive ventilation, and its flexibility also allows it to be a valuable complement in patient management. Its use in acute respiratory failure is well accepted and widespread. It is the focus of this review. The role of noninvasive ventilation in those with chronic respiratory failure is not as clear and remains to be defined. The key to the successful application of noninvasive ventilation is in recognizing its capabilities and limitations. This also requires identification of the appropriate patient for the application of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Patient selection is crucial for the successful application of noninvasive ventilation. Once patients who require immediate intubation are eliminated, a careful assessment of the patient and his or her condition determines if the patient is a candidate for noninvasive ventilation. This requires evaluation on several levels, and it may involve a trial of noninvasive ventilation. The following variables and factors help identify patients who may be candidates for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Absolute contraindications are as follows: Coma Cardiac arrest Respiratory arrest Any condition requiring immediate intubation Other contraindications (rare exceptions) are as follows: Cardiac instability - Shock and need for pressor suppo, ventricular dysrhythmias, complicated acute myocardial infarction GI bleeding - Intractable emesis and/or uncontrollable bleeding Inability to protect airway - Impaired cough or swallowing, poor clearance of secretions, depressed sensorium and lethargy Status epilepticus Potential for upper airway obstruction - Extensive head and neck tumors, any other tumor with extrinsic airway compression, angioedema or anaphylaxis causing airway compromise Other considerations that may limit application are as follows: Implementation - Staff learning curve and time requirements (nursing and respiratory therapy), potential for delay in definitive therapy (limit trials of therapy) After eliminating unsuitable candidates for noninvasive ventilation, successful application of noninvasive ventilation mandates close assessment and selection of patients and identification of conditions best suited for treatment. Not all patients with diagnoses capable of management with noninvasive ventilation (eg, Patient inclusion criteria are as follows: Patient cooperation (an essential component that excludes agitated, belligerent, or comatose patients) Dyspnea (moderate to severe, but sho of respiratory failure) Tachypnea (>24 breaths/min) Increased work of breathing (accessory muscle use, pursed-lips breathing) Hypercapnic Hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2< 200 mm Hg, best in rapidly reversible causes of hypoxemia) NIV is indicated in adults as follows: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with exacerbation. Bilateral pneumonia. Acute congestivehea failure with pulmonary edema. Neuromuscular disorders.

    "explanation": "Airway management in obese Excess fatty tissue tends to make access (intubation, tracheostomy) worse than in lean patients. Proper planning and preparation of airway management is essential: Elevation of the patient's upper body, head and neck. Preoxygenation is mandatory in morbidly obese patients and should be followed by actions to counteract atelectasis formation. Use a rapid sequence induction, an awake intubation or a standard induction with hypnotics should depend on the thorough airway examination and comorbidity and should not be based solely on whether morbid obesity is present or not. Ensure sufficient depth of anaesthesia before initiating manipulation of the airway because inadequate anaesthesia depth predisposes to aspiration if airway management becomes difficult. Intubating laryngeal mask airway is more efficient in the morbidly obese patients than in lean patients and serves as a rescue device for both failed ventilation and failed intubation. In the 24 h following anaesthesia, morbidly obese patients experience frequent oxygen desaturation periods that can be counteracted by continuous positive airway pressure, noninvasive ventilation and physiotherapy."

Though the word exophthalmos is synonymous with proptosis; some source define xophthalmos as a protrusion of globe greater than 18mm and proptosis as a protrusion equal to or less than 18 mm. Proptosis may be classified as follows : ? Unilateral Proptosis Proptosis of one eye. Inflammatory lesions :- Orbital cellulitis, abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, etc. Vascular disturbances :- Haemorrhage, varicose orbital veins, haemangioma, etc. Cysts and tumour :- Dermoid cyst, osteoma, lymphoma, lymphosarcoma, glioma, meningioma of optic nerve, retinoblastoma and metastatic deposits in orbit Neuroblastoma, breast, prostate, lung, GIT, Kidney, Ewing's tumor, melanoma, wilms tumor (Nephroblastoma)]. Systemic diseases - Leukemias and endocrine disturbances such as Graves' disease and thyrotropic exophthalmos in initial stages. Paralysis of extraocular muscles as in complete ophthalmoplegia. Mucocele of PNS' - Frontal (most common), ethmoid, maxillary. Bilateral Proptosis Proptosis of both eyes. evelopmental anomalies of the skull- Oxycephaly (tower skull). Endocrine exophthalmos, both thyrotoxic and thyrotropic. Inflammatory lesions - Cavernous sinus thrombosis. Tumours - lymphosarcoma, lymphoma, pseudotumour, nephroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma. Systemic disease - Histocytosis (Hand - schuller christon disease), amyloidosis, wegner's granulomatosis. Intermittent proptosis Proptosis developing intermittently and rapidly in one eye when venous stasis is induced by forward bending or lowering the head, turning the head forcibly, hyperextension of the neck, coughing, forced expiration with or without compression of the nostrils, or pressure on jugular veins. The most impoant casue is orbital varix (varicocele). Pulsatile proptosis : - Pulsatile proptosis is seen in caroticocovernous fistula; saccular aneurysm of ophthalmic aery; and due to transmitted cerebral pulsation as seen in meningocele, neurofibromatosis and traumatic or operative hiatus."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "The earliest clinical indication of hypermagnesemia is loss of deep tendon reflexes. States of magnesium excess are characterized by generalized neuromuscular depression. Clinically, severe hypermagnesemia is rarely seen except in those patients with advanced renal failure treated with magnesium-containing antacids. However, hypermagnesemia is produced intentionally by obstetricians who use parenteral magnesium sulfate (MgSO4 ) to treat preeclampsia. MgSO4 is administered until depression of the deep tendon reflexes is observed, a deficit that occurs with modest hypermagnesemia (over 4 mEq/L). Greater elevations of magnesium produce progressive weakness, which culminates in flaccid quadriplegia and in some cases respiratory arrest due to paralysis of the chest bellows mechanism. Hypotension may occur because of the direct aeriolar relaxing effect of magnesium. Changes in mental status occur in the late stages of the syndrome and are characterized by somnolence that progresses to coma."

Desflurane's vaporizer are externally heated to 39degC to compensate for significant heat loss a/w desflurane vaporization. It also increases the vapour pressure (to 1300 mmHg), preventing the possibility of boiling in warm rooms. Tech 6 vaporizer is used only with desflurane. Desflurane is heated to 39degC (102degF)Q, which is well above its boiling point (22.8degC), by two heaters in the base. An external heating is needed, because the potency of desflurane requires that large amount be vaporized. And also because the boiling point of desflurane is near room temperature and depending on ambient temperature would make the output unpredictable. These factors make thermo compensation using the usual mechanical devices impossible."

Use for spinal anaesthesia of long durartion has declined after the availability ofbupivacaine\"- KDT 6th/358\"The dibucaine number is a measure of the qualitative activity of pseudocholinesterase and is the percentage of inhibition of the enzyme by the local anesthetic dibucaine. Normal individuals are homozygous for the wild type, and their dibucaine number is 80 because their plasma cholinesterase is 80% inhibited by dibucaine. Those who are homozygous for the atypical genes have a dibucaine number of 20 because of 20% inhibition Heterozygous individuals have a dibucaine number of 60 because of approximately 60% inhibition. The plasma cholinesterase level is a quantitative measure of this enzyme. Plasma cholinesterase should not be confused with cholinesterase activity, which is an assessment of erythrocyte or red blood cell cholinesterase. The combination of dibucaine number and plasma cholinesterase can differentiate genetic from nongenetic causes of prolonged apnea after the administration of succinylcholine\"-Millter 7th/1095Atypical Pseudocholinesterase Ajay Yadav 2nd/88# Incidence :1 in 3000.This can be diagnosed by Dibucaine numberDibucaine is a local anaesthetic which can inhibit 80% of normal enzyme & 20% of abnormal enzyme.

A single dose given on alternate days blocks virtually all of the effects of a dose of heroin.# NALTREXONE decreases the craving for alcohol in chronic alcoholics, and it is FDA approved for this purpose."

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Positive end expiratory pressure decreases venous return and decreases cardiac output and hence blood pressure decreases and decreased perfusion so urine output can reduce. Pulmonary barotrauma is a frequentcomplicationofPEEPtherapy. Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and interstitial emphysema may lead to rapid deterioration of a patient maintained on mechanical ventilation with an already compromised respiratory status. Positive end-expiratory pressure PEEP is a mode of therapy used in conjunction with mechanical ventilation. At the end of mechanical or spontaneous exhalation, PEEP maintains the patient's airway pressure above the atmospheric level by exeing pressure that opposes passive emptying of the lung. This pressure is typically achieved by maintaining a positive pressure flow at the end of exhalation. This pressure is measured in centimeters of water. PEEP therapy can be effective when used in patients with a diffuse lung disease that results in an acute decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of gas that remains in the lung at the end of a normal expiration. FRC is determined by primarily the elastic characteristics of the lung and chest wall. In many pulmonary diseases, FRC is reduced because of the collapse of the unstable alveoli. This reduction in lung volume decreases the surface area available for gas exchange and results in intrapulmonary shunting (unoxygenated blood returning to the left side of the hea). If FRC is not restored, a high concentration of inspired oxygen may be required to maintain the aerial oxygen content of the blood in an acceptable range. Applying PEEP increases alveolar pressure and alveolar volume. The increased lung volume increases the surface area by reopening and stabilizing collapsed or unstable alveoli. This splinting, or propping open, of the alveoli with positive pressure improves the ventilation-perfusion match, reducing the shunt effect. After a true shunt is modified to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch with PEEP, lowered concentrations of oxygen can be used to maintain an adequate PaO2. PEEP therapy may also be effective in improving lung compliance. When FRC and lung compliance are decreased, additional energy and volume are required to inflate the lung. By applying PEEP, the lung volume at the end of exhalation is increased. The already paially inflated lung requires less volume and energy than before for full inflation. When used to treat patients with a diffuse lung disease, PEEP should improve compliance, decrease dead space, and decrease the intrapulmonary shunt effect. The most impoant benefit of the use of PEEP is that it enables the patient to maintain an adequate PaO2 at a low and safe concentration of oxygen (< 60%), reducing the risk of oxygen toxicity . Because PEEP is not a benign mode of therapy and because it can lead to serious hemodynamic consequences, the ventilator operator should have a definite indication to use it. The addition of external PEEP is typically justified when a PaO2 of 60 mm Hg cannot be achieved with an FIO2 of 60% or if the estimated initial shunt fraction is greater than 25%. No evidence suppos adding external PEEP during initial setup of the ventilator to satisfy misguided attempts to supply prophylactic PEEP or physiologic PEEP."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "The first modern halogenated volatile anesthetic, halothane, was introduced in 1955. Clinical exposure to halothane is associated with two distinct types of hepatic injury. Subclinical hepatotoxicity occurs in 20% of adults who receive halothane. It is characterized by mild postoperative elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspaate aminotransferase, but is reversible and innocuous. Anaerobic halothane reduction by CYP2A6 to a 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethyl radical is thought to mediate this mild hepatic injury. The fulminant form of hepatotoxicity, commonly known as halothane hepatitis, is characterized by elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspaate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, massive hepatic necrosis following the administration of halothane. Halothane hepatitis is rare (1 in 5000 to 35,000 administrations in adults), but is fatal in 50% to 75% of these cases. Because of the potential for fatal hepatitis, halothane is no longer used in adult patients in many countries. Halothane hepatitis is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane. The highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane oxidation can react with nearby liver proteins. In most patients who developed hepatic necrosis after halothane anesthesia, antibodies against TFA-modified proteins were detected, suggesting that the hepatic damage is linked to an immune response against the modified protein, which acts as a neoantigen. Accordingly, patients who develop halothane hepatitis often have a history of prior exposures to halothane or other volatile anesthetics, together with symptoms suggestive of immune reactivity, such as fever, rash, ahralgia, and eosinophilia. A current hypothesis is that TFA-protein adducts induce a cytotoxic T cell reaction in sensitized individuals, which leads to liver damage. However, the immune responses observed in halothane hepatitis might not mediate liver injury. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e"

    "explanation": "Vasopressin not used Advanced Cardiac Life Suppo algorithms for cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be followed should cardiac arrest occur. Chest compressions should be initiated immediately and continued until return of spontaneous circulation. If epinephrine is used, small initial doses of <=1 ug[?]kg-1 are preferred to avoid impaired pulmonary gas exchange and increased afterload. Vasopressin is not recommended for use as it has been associated with adverse outcomes in animal models. In the absence of rapid recovery following advanced life suppo measures and intravenous lipid emulsion therapy, early consideration should be given to cardiopulmonary bypass for circulatory suppo. The inotropic effect of lipid emulsion therapy only occurs once the myocardial LA levels are below a threshold that corresponds to ion channel blocking concentrations. This emphasizes the impoance of effective chest compressions to ensure coronary perfusion is sufficient to reduce LA tissue levels in order to obtain the benefit of lipid emulsion therapy. If cardiac output is maintained but there are deleterious CVS effects - such as arrhythmias, conduction block, progressive hypotension, and bradycardia - standard Advanced Cardiac Life Suppo algorithms should be followed with the omission of LA, such as lidocaine, for the treatment of arrhythmia. Amiodarone is the first-line antiarrhythmic in the event of ventricular dysrhythmia."

In most cases it lasts for 7-10 days.o PDPH is believed to result from leakage of CSF from a dural defect and decreased ICT. Loss ofCSF ata rate faster that it can be produced causes traction on structure supporting the brain, particularly dura and tentorium. Traction on cranial nerve (particularly 6th nerve) produces diplopia,o Factors that increase the incidence of PDPH art young age, female sex, Pregnancy, large bore needle and multiple punctures.o Use of small bore needle can prevent PDPH .o Intially conservative treatment is given which includes analgesics (NSAIDs), oral or i.v., fluids, Sumatriptan, cosyntropin, caffeine and recumbent position.o If conservative treatment fails, epidural blood patch can be used. It involves injecting 15-20 ml of autologus blood into the epidural space which stop leakage of CSF by coagulation and mass effect."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Na channel inhibition inside gate Local anesthetics act by inhibiting Na' channels from inside. Mechanism of action of LA Local anaesthetics block generation and conduction of nerve impulse at all pa of neuron where they come in contact, without causing structural damage. Thus not only sensory but motor impulses and autonomic control is also interrupted. Mechanism of action Normally Na+ channel in axonal membrane has following phases : Recovery Resting (close) - Active (open) - Inactive (open) LAs prolong the inactive state --> channel takes longer to recover - refractory period of the fiber is increased. LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Net' channel from inside. Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na' channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor. So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly. Degree of blockade is frequency dependent greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation. Exposure to higher concentration of Ca' reduces inactivation of Na' channels and lessens the block. Order of blockade of fibres B > C > AS> Ace, (3 & y (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order. Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure. When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all. Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated. Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres."

It is at the level of T12 and L, veebrae anterior to the crura of the diaphragm. It contains visceral afferent and efferent fibers divided from T5 to T1, by means of greater, lesser and least splanchnic nerves. Celiac plexus innervates most of the abdominal viscera, therefore this procedure blocks the nerves which come from the pancreas, liver, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, spleen, kidney and adrenal glands. A celiac plexus block can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdominal surgery. Because celiac plexus block results in blockade of the autonomic nervous system, this block may help to reduce stress and endocrine responses to surgery. For the same reason, the most common complication of celiac plexus block is postural hypotenstion because of blockade of lumbar sympathetic chain leading to upper abdominal vessel dilation and venous pooling. Celiac plexus block can be done by following three approaches : - Retrocrural (classic) approach, anterocrural approach and splanchnic nerve block. Celiac plexus block is given to treat intractable pain in chronic pancreatitis, gastric & pancreatic malignancies.

While folate deficiency can also cause megaloblastic anemia, it is rare after paial gastrectomy. Oral B12 is not a reliable method for correcting B12 deficiency; intravenous cyanocobalamin should be administered every 3 to 4 months for life. Other complications of paial gastrectomy includes osteoporosis secondary to impaired calcium absorption due to the Billroth II reconstruction (since calcium is normally absorbed in the proximal intestine--duodenum and jejunum). Also, fatty acids may also be malabsorbed due to inadequate mixing of bile salts and lipase with ingested fat, and therefore steatorrhea may result."

The condition occurs in known viral infections (herpes zoster, Epstein-Barr virus), following injections of tetanus toxoid, in putative viral infections; and as an autobnmune disorder following a surgical procedure.\"- Basic neurology By John Gilroy 3/e p594 Brachial plexus neuritis usually is characterized by the acute onset of excruciating unilateral shoulder pain, followed by flaccid paralysis of shoulder and parascapular muscles several days later. The syndrome can vary greatly in presentation and nerve involvement. Brachial neuritis (BN) exists in an inherited and an idiopathic form. In the idiopathic version, the pathophysiology is unknown, but the condition is generally thought to be an immune system - mediated inflammatory reaction against nerve fibers of the brachial plexus. The onset of pain in brachial neuritis (BN) is often abrupt and may follow recent illness, surgery, immunization, or even trauma (see Causes, below). Up to two thirds of cases begin during the nighttime. Sensory abnormalities are of usually of less intensity than the pain and muscle weakness. Causes: The exact cause of brachial neuritis is unknown, but the condition has been linked to many antecedent events or illnesses, as follows: Viral infection (paicularly of the upper respiratory tract) Bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia, diphtheria, typhoid) Parasitic infestation S urgery 2 Trauma (not related to shoulder) Vaccinations (eg, influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, peussis [DPT J. smallpox, swine flu) Childbih Miscellaneous medical investigative procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, administration of radiologic dye) Systemic illness (eg, polyaeritis nodosa, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal aeritis, EhlersDanlos syndrome) A rarer, hereditary form of BN has been localized to the SEPT9 gene on chromosome arm 17q and should be considered a distinct disorder. This entity presents in a younger age group, and is characterized by recurrent, often bilateral attacks. Dysmorphic facial features (eg, hypotelorism, long nasal bridge, facial asymmetry) can also be present. Diagnosis: Other causes of severe pain, such as an acute herniated cervical disc, should be excluded. In brachial plexus neuritis, electromyography and nerve conduction studies reveal abnormalities in more than one nerve; in contrast, cervical radiculopathy may show osteophytes and interspace narrowing on cervical spine x-rays and neuroforaminal disc impingement of MRI. Treatment: of brachial plexus neuritis is suppoive, with analgesics for pain, physical therapy to maintain shoulder strength/mobility, and reassurance that the condition generally will improve, albeit slowly."

In spinal cord lower segments are affected earlier than upper segments. The vital centers located in the medulla are paralyzed the last as the depth of anaesthesia increases,o Guedel discribed four stages of ether anaesthesia dividing the Illrd stage into 4 planes. With faster acting GAs these clear cut stages are not seen nowr days as induction with these agents is too fast. Stage 1 (Stage of analgesia): - It extends from beginning of anaesthetic inhalation to the loss of conciousness. Stage 2 (Stage of delirium or excitment): - From the loss of conciousness to beginning of regular respiration. There is roving eye ball (maximum movement of eye). Pupil is partially dilated. Eye lashr eflex is lost - First reflex to be lost However eyelid reflex remains present.C) Stage 3 ( stage of surgical anaesthesia): - From beginning of regular respiration to cessation of spontaneous breathing. Most surgeries are done in this stage. It is divided into 4 planes : -Plane 1 : - From beginning of regular respiration to cessation of eye movement. There is roving eye ball. Eye lid reflex is lost. This plane ends when eye ball become fixed. Pupil size is normal.Plane 2 : - From cessation of eye movement to respiratory Paresis. Eye ball is fixed. There is loss of corneal reflex.Pupil starts dilating ( 1/2 dilated).Plane 3 : - From respiratory paresis to respiratoy' paralysis. Pupil 3/4 dilated.

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Emergence delirium Ketamine The primary site of action is in the coex and subcoical areas; not in the reticular activating system (site of action of barbiturates). It acts on NMDA receptors. Sho duration of action (10-15 minutes) is due to redistribution from brain and blood to other tissues of the body. Ketamine is different from most other anaesthetic induction agents in that it has significant analgesic action. Ketamine increases IOT and cerebral metabolism --> contraindicated in head injury. It causes sympathetic stimulation with elevation of HR, CO & BP --) contraindicated in hypeension and ischemic hea disease. It also raises IOT --> contraindicated in glaucoma. It relieves bronchospasm --> intravenous anaesthetic of choice in asthmatics (inhalation anaesthetic of choice in asthmatic is halothane). Injection is not painful (All other inducing agents cause pain on injection). It is i.v. anaesthetic of choice in children (Sevoflurane is inhalation agent of choice). Because it causes sympathetic stimulation it is intravenous anaesthetic of choice in patients with shock and hypovolumia. It has no muscle relaxant propey rather muscle tone is increased. Airway reflexes (pharyngeal and laryngeal) are not depressed --> intravenous anaesthetic of choice for emergency anaesthesia (no starvation is required). Ketamine produces emergence reaction during awakening from anaesthesia --> vivid dreaming, illusions, extracorporeal experiences, excitment, confusion, fear and euphoria --> contraindicated in psychiatric illness like schizophrenia."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Ans. A: Prolonged duration of effect Epidural anaesthesia, a form of regional anaesthesia involving injection of drugs through a catheter placed into the epidural space. The injection can cause both a loss of sensation (anaesthesia) and a loss of pain (analgesia), by blocking the transmission of signals through nerves in or near the spinal cord The anaesthetist may use epidural analgesia in addition to general anaesthesia. This may reduce the patient's requirement for opioid analgesics. This is suitable for a wide variety of surgery, for example gynaecological surgery (e.g. hysterectomy), ohopaedic surgery (e.g. hip replacement), general surgery (e.g. laparotomy) and vascular surgery (e.g. open aoic aneurysm repair) which are longer duration surgeries. Other features of epidural anaesthesia: Expensive compared to spinal anaesthesia More incidence of intravascular injection (epidural space has venous plexus of Batson) More incidence of epidural hematoma Level of block can be changed by increasing the dose through the catheter"

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Predicting difficulty in mask ventilation Mask ventilation is the most basic, and arguably most impoant, skill in airway management. Patients who have been identified as having DMV, or who are predicted to be difficult, are, or potentially are, at the highest risk in airway management. It is this facet of management that should influence our decision-making the most, potentially with consideration given to awake techniques. DMV can also be suggestive of difficulty in subsequent laryngoscopy. DMV occurs in up to 5% of patients, and there are several factors that are known to be predictive of this. An early study highlighted five independent factors Mnemonic OBESE to be used. Fuher study of DMV added modified Mallampati class of 3 or 4, limited jaw protrusion, and the male sex. Neck irradiation is the most significant predictor of impossible mask ventilation, defined as an inability to achieve gas exchange despite the use of adjuncts, multiple providers, and neuromuscular block, as it causes development of fibrotic non-compliant tissue affecting the airway. BMI itself is not a very useful predictor, although it can be a marker for potential oxygenation issues (due to reduced FRC) and increased aspiration risk. In predicting DA, the actual distribution of body fat should be considered, with fat deposition in the parapharyngeal tissues increasing airway collapsibility, predisposing to OSA. This is seen more in android pattern obesity with distribution of adipose tissue around the trunk, upper body, and neck. The increased fat deposits in neck tissue can fuher narrow the airway. OSA, snoring without apnoea, and increasing neck circumference, above 40 cm, are associated with DMV. The probability of DMV increases with increasing neck circumference. Age >55 BMI > 26 (obesity) Beard Lack of teeth(edentulous) History of snoring (OSA) Neck circumference (>17 inches in men and > 16cm in women) Thyromental distance Large tongue facial and neck deformity Cervical spine disease or previous cervical spine surgery"
