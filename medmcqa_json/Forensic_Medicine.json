Thus, they have exactly identical DNA, except for the generally undetectable micromutations that begin as soon as the cell starts dividing.o Fingerprints of the identical twins start their development from the same DNA so they show considerable genetic similarity.o However identical twins are situated in different parts of the womb during development, so each fetus encounters slightly different intrauterine forces than their siblings.o As a result fingerprints of the identical twins have different microdetails which can be used for identification purposes."

This is so because action alobe does not amount to guilt unless if is accompanied by a guilty mind. And, a child of that tender age cannot have a guilty mind or criminal intention with which the act is done. This presumption, however, is only confined to offenses under the IPC but not to other Acts, e.g., the Railway Act.83A child above seven and under twelve years of age is presumed to be capable of committing an offence it he has obtained sufficient maturity to understand and judge the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. The law presumes such maturity' in a child of that age unless the contrary is proved by the defence.89A child under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent to suffer any harm which can occur from an act done in good faith and for its benefit, e.g., a consent for an operation. Only, a guardian can give such consent.87A person under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent, whether express or implied, to suffer any harm which may result from an act no intended or not known to cause death or grievous hurt e.g. consent for a wrestling contest.84Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is uncapable of knowing the nature of act (i.e. it is wrong or contrary to law).85,86Drunkness and criminal responsibilityQ"

B: Pressure Abrasion Teeth marks in biting and ligature marks in hanging and strangulation are example of imprint, pressure or contact abrasion Abrasion It as also known as - Graze or Scratch or Impression. An abrasion is a superficial injury to the skin which involves the loss of superficial epithelial layer (Uppermost layers of the cells of skin) of skin. Abrasions are produced by ? - Blow - Fall on some rough and hard substance - Dragging as in vehicular accidents. - Scratching with finger nails, bites and thorns etc. - Friction on some hard substance. Pressure of rope or cord as is found in strangulation and hanging etc. - Rubbing. - Indenting of the objects. Varieties of Abrasions Scratches- They are due to a sharp or a pointed object pressing across the skin, moving the surface layers in front of it and causing the heaping up of layers of skin. Grazes- They are modified scratches. - In this, the broader surface of skin comes in contact with the uneven rough object. - In this, the depth may vary at different places. - The direction is indicated by presence of clean commencement and tag at the finishing end. Impact Abrasions/Pressure Abrasions - They are also known as \"Imprint abrasions\". - They are caused by the stamping of some object against the skin like radiators of cars in vehicular accidents or - They may be caused by pressure on the skin which is accompanied by movements as found in? Ligature in cases of hanging or strangulation. Injuries caused by lashes with whip Sites of Abrasions ? The abrasions resulting from friction against rough surface during a fall are generally found on the bony pas and are accompanied with contusions or lacerations The abrasions caused by finger nails are seen on the exposed of body like - Face near forearm, hands, thighs etc. They are cresentric in shape, when finger nails are used. Ecchymosis is a common accompaniment. The abrasions caused by teeth bite are elliptical or circular in shape and often present separate marks. Typical impression of teeth by different sets of teeth (Deciduous or permanent) is marked. The intervening area is only a bruised area. The abrasions from radiators are honey-comb in appearance and are .commonly found in vehicular accidents Difference between Antemoem and Postmoem Bruise Antemoem abrasions will show signs of inflammation and repair whereas these will be absent in postmoem abrasions."

Procedure: The stomach and intestine are removed separately after tying double ligature at each end, place them both in water. They float in water if respiration has taken place, otherwise they will sink No medicolegal value Because air may be swallowed by child in attempting to free the air passage of fluid obstruction in case of still-bih. It is useless in putrefaction Other Tests in Infanticide For Lungs Static test or Fodere's testa: Weight of lung before (30-40 g) and after 66 gm) is measured. The increase in weight of lung is due to increased blood flow Ploucquet's testa: Weight of lung is doubled after respiration (Before respiration-1/70 of body weight, after respiration-1/35 of body weight) Hydrostatic test (Raygat's test)a: It is based on a fact that on breathing, the volume of lungs is increased, which more than compensates the weight of additional blood, due to which their specific gravity is diminished. For Middle Ear Werdin's test: Before bih, the middle ear contains gelatinous embryonic connective tissue. With respiration, the sphincter at the pharyngeal end of eustachian tube relaxes and air replaces the gelatinous substance in few hours to five weeks. This is not reliable"

It occurs when a dead fetus remains in the uterus for 3-4 days surrounded by liquor amnii but with exclusion of air. Skin slippage is the earliest sign (occurs within 12 hours). There is gas in the great vessels and chambers of hea (Robe's sign). Except for lung and uterus, which remain unchanged for a long time, all other organs become soft, oedematous and loose there morphology. The one impoant radiological sign suggestive of maceration is 'Spaulding's sign' i.e. skull bones override each other. The smell is somewhat rancid. 3) Putrefaction (decomposition) : If the membranes are ruptured after death of fetus and air gains entry into liquor amnii, fetus undergoes putrefaction instead of maceration. Body is greenish, foul smelling and bloated. 4) Mummification : It results when there is deficient blood supply, scanty liquor and no air enters uterus.

All phosphorus poisoning are caused by white (yellow) phosphorus (Red phosphorus is nontoxic).Phosphorus poisoningo Phosphorus is a protoplasmic poison affecting cellular oxidation and causing anoxic necorbiosis, classically affecting liver. It increases fat deposition and inhibits glycogen deposition in liver. It is used in fire works (Diwali poisoning) and as rat poison. Lethal dose is 60-120 mg.o Phosphorus occurs in two formsWhite/yellow phosphorus: It is white, and becomes yellow on exposure to air. It is translucent, waxy, luminous and crystalline cylinders. It has garlic like odor. It is insoluble in water and luminous in dark. Its fumes show phosphorescence.Red phosphorus : It is reddish brown, inert, odourless and tasteless. It is nontoxic (thus poisoning occurs only due to white phosphorus). It is put on the sides (striking surface) of match box (along with powdered galss).Acute poisoningo It has following stages :1st Stage <GI irritation): There is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and garlic odor. This stage lasts for 8 hours to 3 days.2nd Stage (Asymptomatic): This stage lasts for 3 days.3rd Stage : There is liver and kidney damage due to absorbed phosphorus. Initially liver is enlarged due to acute fatty infiltration. Later liver shruks due to necrosis, i.e. acute yellow atrophy.Chronic poisoningo Toothache is the first symptom which is associated with loosening of teeth, necrosis of gums and osteomyelitis of jaw. Therefore chronic phosphorus poisoning is also know as phossy jaw (or glass jaw).Postmortem appearanceo There is garlic odor. Viscera and stool glow in dark (due to luminosity).o To preserve luminosity, viscera are preserved in saturated saline solution. Rectified spirit is not used as it causes loss ofluminosity."

Criminal negligence occurs when the doctor shows gross lack of competence or inaction, gross recklessness or wanton indifference to the patient's safety, or gross negligence in the selection and application of remedies. It involves an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of care.\"Inadvertent Negligence (Accidental negligence):Inadvertent negligence can be called simple negligence.In this case, the harm done is neither foreseen nor willed.Corporate Negligence:It occurs when a health care corporation failed to perform those duties, it owes directly to a patient or anyone else to whom it may extend.If such a duty is breached and patient is injured due to result of the breach, the organization can be held under the theory of corporate negligence.Res Ipsa Loquitur:Latin meaning of phrase is- the things or facts speaks for itself.This rule is applied when the following conditions are satisfied:That in the absence of negligence the injury would not have occurred ordinarily.That doctor had exclusive control over injury producing instrument or treatment That the patient was not guilty of contributory negligence."

This results in increased concentration of acetylcholine and excessive cholinergic activity.They inhibit cholinesterase by phosphorylating the catalytic site of enzyme. Less than 50% of cholinesterase activity is indicative of poisoning.Clinical features of poisoning are due to excessive cholinergic activity. Local muscarinic manifestations at the site of exposure (skin, eye, GIT) occur immediately and are followed by complex, systemic effects due to muscarinic, nicotinic and central actions"

Children who had died after chronic illness, who had mostly confined to bed for weeks or months, also showed frequently little or no postmortem stiffness because their musculature had faded away during that time. Some expert belive that the low degree of but perceptible stiffness as absence of rigor mortis.Variables affecting onset and duration of rigor:* Variables which accelerate the onset of rigor oExogenous heat, violent exertion prior to death, seizure activity, alkaloid poisoning.* Factors which delay the onset of rigor:a. Exogenous coldb. Exsanguination haemorrhagec. Asphyxial deathsd. Poisoning by arsenicConditions simulating rigor1. Cadaveric spasm: This is a rare form of muscular stiffening which occurs at the time of death. It usually affects groups of muscles in the arms.2. Heat stiffening: This process is seen in fire deaths and involves actual cooking of the muscle fibers. Because the fibers shorten, one sees a typical \"pugilistic\" appearance.2. Cold stiffening: Fat and muscle become solid at temperatures less than 40deg F. Rigor will develop if a body which was frozen before rigor developed is subsequently thawed."

Doctrine of partial responsibility - if a person is suffering from some weakness or aberration of mind (though not completely insane), he is only partially responsible for his actions, e.g. obsession states or depressions.3. Durban rule- Accused is not responsible for the act, if his act resulted from mental disease or defect.4. Currens rule- A person is not responsible if at the time of committing the crime, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct according to the requirements of law, as a result of his mental disease or defect.5. American law institute test-Insane lacks the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to confirm to the requirements of law, therefore he is not responsible for crimes committed.6.

The changes occurs on three components: dorsal surface, ventral surface, and margin. At the age of about 20 years, there is formation of horizontal ridges of bone on the aicular surface which first stas on the upper poion of the ventral surface and extends to the dorsal surface. This is called billowing. At about 25-35 years, the surface becomes granular and the ventral nd dorsal margins are well defined. A rim formation stas from the dorsal surface extends to the ventral surface. At about 35 -45 years, the upper and lower end will be raised and also the ventral margin by bony extension which is called lipping and the beaded rim development will be complete on all around the margins of the aicular surface. By 45-55 years, the beaded rim stas breaking. By 55-65 years the breakdown of the rim is more and by the end of seventh decade the breakdown of the rim will be complete.

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Vagal inhibition Types of drowning Drowning is classified as (1) typical and (2) atypical. 1. Typical drowning (wet drowning) Typical drowning refers to obstruction of air passages and lungs by inhalation of water or other fluid. Therefore it is also called wet drowning and findings offluid and froth are present in PM examination. Typical drowning may be :- Fresh water drowning : In fresh water drowning large quantities of water cross the alveolar membrane into circulation causing hypervolaemia and hemodilution. RBCs imbibe water and burst (hemolysis) with liberation of potossium. Therefore, hea is exposed to volume overload, potassium excess, sodium deficit (hyponatremia), and anoxia. Anoxia and hyperkalemia cause ventricular fibrillation and death in 4-5 minutes. Salt water drowning : Hypeonicity of inhaled water causes loss of fluid from circulation into the lungs giving rise fulminating pulmonary edema with progressive hypovolaemia, circulatary shock, and eventually cardiac standstill (asystole) with death in 8-12 minutes. 2. Atypical drowning It refers to drowning in which even after submersion of body in water, little or no water anters respiratory passages and lungs. Hence typical findings of wet drowning in the form of froth and oedema aquosum of lungs are not found. Atypical drowning may be :- Dry drowning : On contact with water, especially cold water, there results intense laryngospasm, so that water does not enter the lungs. Death is due to asphyxia because of laryngospasm. Immersion syndrome (hydrocution/submersion inhibition/vagal inhibition) : Sudden death occurs due to vagal inhibition as a result of (a) sudden impact with cold water, (b) duck diving (falling in water with feet first), and (c) horizontal entry in water with impact on epigastrium. Submersion of unconscious : If person is unconscious since before submersion in water, little or no water enters respiratory passages. It may occur in MI, cerebrovascular accident, hypeension, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm and in drunk state. Near drowning (secondary drowning syndrome/post immersion syndrome) : In this drowning is survived and death occurs at a later stage after removal from water. Either the person himself comes out of water or he is recovered alive, but due to complications of submersion, he dies at a later stage. It is due to hypoxic encephalopathy and fibrosing alveolitis. The death occurs due to combined effect of cerebral hypoxia, pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonitis, electrolyte disturbances and metabolic acidosis."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., forehead LACERATIONS (Tear or Rupture)o Lacerations are tears or splits of skin, mucous membrane and underlying tissue (e.g., muscle or internal organs). Lacerations are produced by application of blunt force to broad area of the body, which crush or stretch tissues beyond the limits of their elasticity. Localized portions of tissue are displaced by the impact of the blunt force, which sets up traction forces and causes tearing of tissues. Features of lacerations are:-i) Hair and hair bulb, nerves and blood vessels are crushed - There may be paralysis (nerve crushed) and hemorrhage is not pronounced (blood vessels crushed).ii) Site of injury is the site of impact.iii) Shape of injury is irregular, margins are irregular and contused/abraded and show tags of tissue.iv) Size of injury does not corresponds to impacting surface.o There are following types of laceration:-1) Split laceration : Splitting occurs by crushing of skin between two hard objects. Blunt force on areas where the skin is close to rigid structures like bone with scanty subcutaneous tissue, may produce a wound that by linear splitting of tissue may look like incised wound, i.e., incised like or incised looking wound. Examples of such area are scalp, eye brows, cheek bones (zygomatic), lower jaw, iliac crest, perineum and skin. A wound produced by a fall on knee or elbow with limb flexed and by a sharp stone also simulates incised wound.2) Strech lacerations: Overstretching of the skin, if it is fixed, will cause laceration, for example, by kicking, sudden deformity of bone occurs after fracture, making it compound.3) Avulsion (shearing laceration): An avulsion is a laceration produced by sufficient force (shearing force) delivered at an acute angle to detach (tear off) a portion of a traumatized surface or viscus from its attachment, the shearing and grinding force by a weight. Flaying is type of avulsion in which shearing and grinding force by weight (such as of lorry wheel passing over a limb) may produce avulsion (separation of skin from underlying tissue/degloving of a large area).4) Tears: Tears of the skin and tissues can occur from imact by a against irregular or semi-sharp objects, such as door handle of a car. This is another form of overstretching.5) Cut laceration: Cut lacerations may be produced by a heavy sharp edged instrument."

Only live body with a circulation can transpo diatoms form lung to brain, bone marrow, muscles etc. So, presence of diatoms in brain and bone marrow indicates death due to drowning. For detection of diatoms, bone marrow of long bones, e.g. femur, tibia, humerus or sternum is highly suitable and reliable. As diatoms resist acid digestion, to extract them acid digestion techinique is used. Diatoms test is negative in dead bodies thrown in water and in dry drowning. However, diatoms test is invalid, if deceased had drunk this water before submersion or species of diatoms do not match with specimen from the site of drowning"

Normally the chloride content is equal in the right and left chambers of the heart (600 mg/100 ml). In fresh water drowning due to hemodilution the chloride content is decreased and in salt water drowning due to hemoconcentration the chloride content is increased in left side of heart. A 25% difference in chloride is significant but the test is of doubtful value.o Limitations of gettler test:-1. No value in atypical drowning; congenital cardiac defects as shunts and patent foramen ovale; and if drowning medium contains same amount of chloride.2. There is progressive loss of Cl- from blood after death. Therefore the test has to be made within a reasonably short time after death."

These clauses are not mutually exclusive for there can be injuries which may fall in more than one clause. However, the list is exhaustive in the sense that, the framers of the Code have used the term \"only\", while listing the type of hus which they designated as \"grievous\". This positively shows that the list is exhaustive and no hu outside the list given in S. 320 can be termed as 'grievous hu'. The following kinds of hu only are designated as \"grievous\" Emasculation. Permanent privation of the sight of either eye. Permanent privation of the hearing of either ear Privation of any member or joint. Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint. Permanent disfiguration of the head or face. Fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth. Any hu which endangers life or which causes the sufferer to be during the space of twenty days in severe bodily pain or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. Where injury was caused on the abdomen with a sharp edged weapon and the doctor had stated that the injury had penetrated the abdominal cavity but had not involved any vital organs/ impoant structures, but had just touched the stomach, it was held that the accused had caused only simple hu. Similarly, cutting of a tendon or a muscle does not make the injury fall under purview of any clauses of S 320 IPC.

Width of injury is more than the thickness of blade, due to gaping of wound. Langer's line of skin determines gaping : gaping is more when cut is across these lines Margins are eveed, clear, and clean cut Clean incised wounds heal by primary intention, whereas diy, infected or large wounds heal by secondary intention, with scar formation.

Cartridge consists of (i) Cartridge case, (ii) Propellant (gun powder), (iii) Projectile (missile) and (iv) Wads (only in shotguns.).1) Cartridge case# It is the outer shell or covering of the cartridge. In shotgun it is cylinderical. Base is of brass and rest of it is of cardboard or plastic. In rifled weapons, it is tapering and whole of it is made of brass or steel.# Center of base has percussion cap (detonator cap) which has sensitive composition, i.e. primer, consisting of potassium chlorate, antimony sulphide, mercury fulminate, barium nitrite, lead peroxide or tetrazene.# In all weapons, after firing, the cartridge case remains in the barrel and it is to be taken out manually (shotgun, revolvers, rifle) or it is ejected out automatically, e.g. in pistals.2) Propellent (gun powder)# It propels the projectile (missile) forward. It is composed of black powder or smokeless powder in the form of grains, pellets, thin cylindrical cords or flakes. Its ignition results in formation of expanding hot gases under pressure which (gas pressure) propels the projectile (missile) by providing it necessary muzzle velocity and striking energy.# The classical gun powder is known as black powder, consists of charcol (15%), Sulphur (10%), and potassium nitrate (75%). Depending on fineness, the black gun powder is designated as FG, FFG, FFFG. etc. (F = fineness). Pyrodex is another gun powder with same components, but with different ratios.# Black gun powder produces smoke, i.e. It is smoke producing powder. Smokeless powder, in addition to black powder, has nitrocellulose (single base), or nitrocellulose plus nitroglycerine (double base), or nitrocellulose plus nitroglycerine plus nitroguanidine (triple base). Semi smokeless powder has 80% black powder and 20% smokeless powder (nitrocellulose).3) Projectile (missile)# Projectile is an object propelled by force of rapidly burning gases. In shotgun these are lead shots and pellets (recently steel is also used instead of lead) and in rifled weapons (pistal, rifle, revolver), these are bullets. Tip of the bullet is knwon as nose.4) Wads# Wads are present only in the cartridge of a shot gun. Wad can be made of paper, left, card board, or plastic. These are circular disc of various thicknesses, used to adjust the contents of a shotgun cartridge.# Felt wad (wad made of felt) is imprignated with grease and this lubricates the bore (inside of barrel)."

Hydrostatic test (Raygat's test, I\" life test) : The specific gravity of a non-respired lung is 1040-1050 and of a respired lung is 940-950, so, after respiration lung floats on water (specific gravity of water is 1000). False positive hydrostatic test may occur (i.e.non-respired lung may float) in decomposition and in attempted aificial respiration. False negative hydrostatic test (i.e. respired lung may sink down) may occur in atelectasis, pulmonary oedema, bronchopneumonia, and congenital syphylis. Breslau's second life test : It assumes that a live born child would respire and therefore, would also swallow some air into the stomach and bowel. Hence they float on water. This test is falsely positive in putrefaction (due to putrefied gases) or in cases of attempted aificial respiration. Werdin's test : Before bih middle ear contains gelatinous embryonic tissue which is replaced by air after respiration"

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Exhibitionism Incent means sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is closely related to him by blood. eg a daughter, granddaughter. Sexual perversions -These are persistently indulged sexual acts in which complete satisfaction is sought and obtained without sexual intercourse. These include :? a) Sadism : Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on one's paner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc. b) Lust murder : In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm. c) Necrophagia : (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat) : This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure. d) Masochism : Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, toured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual paner. e) Necrophilia : In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants. f) Fetishism : A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm. eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc. g) Transvestism = Fonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interest, and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality. h) Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these pas with several fingers or whole hands (it is an offence when done in public). i) Exhibitionism (Sec 294 IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine). j) Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom : Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman. k) Frotteurism : Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone. l) Undinism : In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex. m) Indecent assault (Sec 354 IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual pa of either or is sexually ored. In such assaults, a man may try to kiss a woman, press or fondle with her breasts, touch or expose the genitalia or thighs, try to put a finger in her vagina, play with vulva. A medical practitioner can be accused of indecent assault if he examines a female patient by stripping her clothes without her consent or even with her consent in the absence of a female attendant. Such assaults are punishable under Sec 354 IPC, upto 2 years imprisonment and/or fine. n) Uranism : General term for perversion of the sexual instinct. o) Satyriasis : Incessant sexual desire. p) Priapism : Painful penile erection in absence of sexual desire."

According to this test, if death occured in salt water, the blood chloride concentration was greater in the left hea chambers when compared to right due to hemoconcentration. If death occured in fresh water, the blood chloride concentration was greater in the right hea chambers due to hemodilution. Diatom test can be used to differentiate between drowning and non drowning cases. According to this test if a person dies from drowning in water containing diatoms, it can be demonstrated in the lung parenchyma and in distant organs such as hea, brain, kidney and bone. Whereas if a dead body is immersed in water, diatoms can be demonstrated only in the lung parnchyma and not in other organs. Because diatoms reach the lungs by passive percolation but not to distant organs because of absent circulation.

These offences are sodomy, buccal coitus, tribadism (lesbianism), and bestiality'.Sodomyo Sodomy is sexual intercourse through anus. It is of two types : Homosexual and Heterosexual. In Homosexual, it is done by a male on another male. Heterosexual sodomy is anal intercourse with a women. The person who does the act is knowm as active agent and the person, on wrhom the act is done, is known as passive agent. If the passive agent is adult/elderly the act is knowTi as Gerontophilia. If the passive agent in sodomy is a child, act is called Paederasty, the passive agent is labelled as catamite, and the active agent is known as Paedophile,o Examination findings of sodomy areIn active agent: (i) Peculiar smell of anal gland secretion on penis, (ii) Fecal soiling, lubricant (if used) and blood on penis, (iii) Penis shaft is elongated and constricted in habitual sodomites with consequent twisting/ angulation of urethra, (iv) Abrasions on prepuce and glans penis, tearing of frenulum, swelling and redness of penis.In passive agent: Passive agent may beHabitual: (i) Funnel shaped anus with deeply situated ana! opening, (ii) Dilatation and laxity of anal sphincter, (iii) Shaved anal skin, (iv) Anal fissures and piles, (v) Lateral buttock truction test positive: On applying lateral traction on anus in normal person, there will be reflex contraction of anus, but in habitual sodomine there is comple relaxation of sphincter with dilatation of opening.Non-habitual (forcibly victimized) : (i) Presence ofsemen in anus is the only confirmatery evidence, (ii) Signs of violence around anus, i.e. abrasions, fisures, contusion or triangular bruised tear of posterior part of anus (in sudden violence).Other unnatural sexual offenceso Bestiality: is the sexual intercourse by a human being with a lower animal.o Tribadism (Lesbianism or female homosexuality): Sexual gratification of a women is obtained by another woman by kissing, body contact, manipulation of breast and genitalia. Active partner is called dyke or butch and the passive agent is called femme. This is not an offence in India.o Buccal coitus (coitus per as/sin of gomorrah): In this, the male organ is introduced into mouth, usually of a young child. Fellatio is oral stimulation of penis by male or female. Cunnilingus is oral stimulation of female genitals."

(in the same order) Casper's dictum relates to the rate of putrefaction of a dead body and helps in estimation of time since death. Putrefaction is arrested below 0degC & above 48degCQ as the activity of microorganism stops. Putrefaction is facilitated by free access of air, moisture & optimum temperature (10degC-450C), so decomposition is fast in shallow damp, marshy gravesQ in bodies without clothes & coffin."

    "explanation": "Patient [Ref- Reddy's Forensic 29/e p30; Parikh 6/e p1.441 \"Generally speaking, it is for the patient in an action for negligence to establish the guilt of the doctor, whose innocence is otherwise assumed.\"- Parikh However, in cases where the rule of res ipso loguitur is applied, the patient need not prove negligence. Res ipso loquitur means that \"the thing or fact speaks for itself.\" The patient has to merely state what according to him was the act of negligence. The 3 essential conditions considered necessary for res ipsa loquitur are: The nature of injury suggests by common knowledge or expe evidence that without negligence it does not occur. The patient must not contribute to his own injury The doctor had exclusive control over the injury producing instrument or treatment. Professional negligence Professional negligence is defined as absence of reasonable care and skill, or wilful negligence of a medical practioner in the treatment of a patient, which causes bodily injury or death of the patient. The word negligence is defined as the omission to do something (act of omission) which a reasonable person would do, or doing something (act of commission) which a reasonable person would not do. To prove an act of negligence the onus lies on the patient (or his relative if the patient has died). Following conditions must be proved by the patient (4Ds): Duty- the doctor (defendant) owed him a duty of care. Dereliction- the doctor failed to perfonn that duty. Damage- the patient suffered actual damage due to negligence of the doctor. iv. Direct causation- the doctor's negligence directly led to the damage without any other intervening cause. Professional negligence can be of 2 types: Civil negligence and Criminal negligence. Civil negligence Civil negligence arises - when a patient (or his relative, in case of patient's death) files suit in a civil cou to get compensation from his doctor for the injury or death of the patient due to doctor's negligence. - a doctor files civil suit to get fees from his patient, who refuses to pay alleging negligence. Criminal negligence Criminal negligence arises when the degree of negligence is so grave that it goes beyond matters of comensation. Case is filed in a criminal cou. Criminal negligence occurs when the doctor shows gross lack of competence, or gross inaction, gross recklessness, gross negligence in selection and application of remedies. It involves extreme depaure from the ordinary standard of care. Criminal negligence cases are very rare. Note that- A doctor will not be criminally liable if a patient dies due to an error of judgement or carelessness or want of due caution, though lie can be liable to pay compensation. Examples of criminal negligence? - Amputation of wrong limb or digit or of the wrong patient. - Leaving instruments, tubes, sponges or swabs within the body. - Gross mismanagement under the influence of alcohol or drugs - Performing criminal aboion - Administration of a wrong substance into the eye causing loss of vision. - Giving wrong or infected blood. - Gangrene after too tight plastering. Note that? Even if a doctor is negligent, a patient is not entitled for any compensation if no damage has occurred. An error in diagnosis or treatment is not negligence provided proper care and skill has been exercised. Contributory negligence is not a defence in criminal negligence. (Contributory negligence is any negligence on the pa of the patient or his attendant, which along with the doctor's negligence, contributed to the injury) Criminal negligence cases are dealt under I.P.C. section 304A."

The tremors are coarse, intentional type, interspersed with jerky movements, initially involving hands. Later it involves lip, tongue, arms and legs. The advanced condition of tremors is called as \"Hatter's shakes\" (because the condition was first described among felt hat workers). In Hatter's shakes, the tremor becomes so severe that daily activities of person are grossly impaired such as shaving, writing, holding cup etc. As the disease progresses, the most severe form of tremor are called as \"Concussio mercurialis\" which means no activity is possible * Mercurial erethism - a classical manifestation of chronic mercury poisoning characterized by cluster of psychiatric symptoms including disturbance inpersonality, abnormal shyness, timidity, loss of self confidence, insomnia, excitability, progressing later into delirium with hallucinations (Mad as hatter). * Colitis * Melanosis coli * Mercury dermatitis - from mercuric sulphide (cinnabar) as red areas of tattoo has been repoed. * Dementia * Renal failure * Acrodynia (Pink disease):-Seen mostly in children and caused by chronic mercury exposure.

The label should mention the name, age, sex, registration number, etc. (2) Workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis or external injury should not handle AIDS victims. (3) Proper protective clothing, full sleeves overalls instead of simple surgical gowns, water-proof plastic apron, head cap, face mask, goggles if eye glasses are not worn, double gloves (heavy autopsy gloves over surgical gloves), waterproof rubber gumboots of knee length with shoe covers. A plastic visor will protect eyes and mucosal surfaces from splash injury. A high efficiency paiculate air- filled respirator or a powered air-purifying respirator should be worn. ( 4) Handling sharp instruments: Avoid accidental pricks and cuts from needles, scalpels, etc. If a cut is made in the rubber gloves or needle injury occurs they should be removed immediately and replaced with new ones. Hands and other skin surfaces should be washed immediately and thoroughly if contaminated with blood or other body fluids. Infection of AIDS can be acquired by transdermal inoculation through cuts and needle punctures. About 0.3 to 0.5% of individuals will become seropositive. Transmission rates from contaminated needle punctures or close contact are 10 to 30 times higher for serum hepatitis than for AIDS. The incident should be repoed to proper authority to get their blood check for HIV seropositivity. (5) Handling specimens for laboratory examination: Mucocutaneous contact with the body fluids, and aerosol inhalation should be avoided. They should be properly labelled andfilled with 10% formalin solution and should be handled with gloved hands. (6) Disposal of used instruments: They should be dipped in 20% glutaraldehyde (cidox) for half-an-hour, washed with soap or detergent and water, dried and then rinsed in methylated spirit and air dried. (7) All soiled gauze and cotton, etc. should be collected in a double plastic bag for incineration. (8) Laundry material, such as aprons, towels, etc. should be soaked in one percent bleach for half-an-hour, washed with detergent and hot water, and autoclaved. (9) Clean- up procedure: Wear new intact disposable gloves. Small spatters and spills of blood and other body fluids can be wiped up with disposable tissues o1* towels which are discarded in special bio-hazard bags and properly disposed. The autopsy table and floor should be cleaned with one percent bleach solution, followed by washing with soap and water. (10) Disinfectants: 1:10 dilution of common household bleach or a freshly prepared sodium hypochlorite solution are recommended. Liquid chemical germicides commonly used in health care facilities and laboratories are effective against HIV. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-121,122"

If under the influence of an insane delusion, a person thinks another man is attempting to kill him and he kills that man in self-defense, he will not be held criminally responsible. If under the influence of an insane delusion, a person thinks another man to be a wild animal and kills him, he will not be held criminally responsible. Sec. 85 IPC: Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who at the time of doing it, by reason of intoxication, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to law; provided that thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will."

This enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide conves colourless salts into coloured bases. Thus these tests are based on H2O2 and peroxidase enzyme. Tests are :- i) Benzidine test : Greenish blue colour. Phenolphthalein test (kastle myere test) : Deep permanganate colour. Leucomalachite green test : Bluish green or peacock blue colour. Guaiacum test : Blue colour. Ohotoludine test (kohn test) : Blue or green colour. Amidopyrine test : Purple colour. 2) Microchemical tests These tests are based on propey of haem pa of hemoglobin to form characteristic coloured crystals. The tests are :? Teichmann's haemin crystal test. Takayama hemochromogen crystal test. Luminal spray test: It is especially useful in old obscure blood stains. 3) Spetroscopy It is most delicate and reliable test.

It can be present in contaminated country liquor used to denature ethanol.* It is the accumulation of formic acid which causes toxic effects in methanol poisoning. Accumulation of formic acid results in lactic acidosis/high anion gap metabolic acidosis with low plasma bicarbonates, blindness due to retinal damage, papilledema and optic atrophy.* Symptoms of poisoning are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, headache, abdominal pain, respiratory depression, cyanosis, acute tubular necrosis, hypothermia, fixed dilated pupils, visual distrubance (blurring of vision; photophobia) and odor of spirit in breath. Fatal dose in adults is 60-240 ml in adults, but as little as 15 ml can cause blindness.* Methanol poisoning can be treated by supportive measures, gastric lavage and sodium bicarbonate (to treat acidosis) ethanol is useful because it competitively inhibits the conversion of methanol to formic acid. Fomepizole can also be used as it is a specific inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. Folic acid or folinic acid enhance the metabolism of formic acid to C02.

Hence typical findings of wet drowning in the form offroth and oedema aquosum of lungs are not found. Atypical drowning may be :Dry drowning: On contact with water, especially cold water, there results intense laryngospasm, so that water does not enter the lungs. Death is due to asphyxia because of laryngospasm.Immersion syndrome (hydrocution/submersion inhibition/vagal inhibition): Sudden death occurs due to vagal inhibition as a result of (a) sudden impact with cold water, (b) duck diving (falling in water with feet first), and (c) horizontal entry in water with impact on epigastrium.Submersion of unconscious : If person is unconscious since before submersion in water, little or no water enters respiratory passages. It may occur in MI, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm and in drunk state.Near drowning (secondary drowning syndrome/post immersion syndrome): In this drowning is survived and death occurs at a later stage after removal from water. Either the person himself comes out of water or he is recovered alive, but due to complications of submersion, he dies at a later stage. It is due to hypoxic encephalopathy and fibrosing alveolitis. The death occurs due to combined effect of cerebral hypoxia, pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonitis, electrolyte disturbances and metabolic acidosis."

In shotgun these are lead shots and pellets (recently steel is also used instead of lead) and in rifled weapons (pistal, rifle, revolver), these are bullets. Tip of the bullet is knwon as nose. Varieties of bullets are :-Incendiary (igniting) bullet: The tip of bullet contains self igniting material e.g. barium nitrate and powdered aluminium and magnesium (in the past, phosphorus was used), so that it catches fire on hitting the target. It is used to cause fire in usually inflammable targets like fuel tanks (of air crafts etc).Explosive bullet: The tip contains a detonator or lead azide, so that the bullet explodes on hitting the target.Dum-dum bullet (expanding bullet) : It is a jacketed bullet with is nose tip chiseled or cut off. It is designed to increase in diameter and expand upon striking the target, thus producing larger diameter wounds of limited penetration.Tandem bullet (Piggey tail bullet) : It is called one-behind-other bullet because two bullets are ejected one after the other, when first bullet failed to leave the burrel and is ejected by subsequently fired bullet. Therefore, both enter body through same enterance wound (some times, they may enter through different entries), but the wounds of exit are always two.o Tandem (Duplex) cartridge is one in which two bullets are present in same cartridge. It is used in military rifles.Tracer bullet: It leaves a trace in atmosphere along the path so that a person (gunner) can observ e the strike. Burning of barium nitrate produces flame and powdered magnesium along with strontium nitrate are added to give red color to the flame.Tumbling bullet: One that rotates in end on end during its motion.Yawning bullet: One which travels in an irregular fashion and causes a key hole entery wound. Yaw means deviation between long axis of bullet and the axis of path of bullet.Souvenir bullet: A bullet left in body for long time and is surrounded by fibrous tissue.Frangite bullet: Designed to fragment upon impact.Mushrooming of bullet: A soft nose bullet, an hitting the target may get deformed to assume the shape of a mushroom."

These offences are sodomy, buccal coitus, tribadism (lesbianism), and bestiality. Sodomy Sodomy is sexual intercourse through anus. It is of two types : Homosexual and Heterosexual. In Homosexual, it is done by a male on another male. Heterosexual sodomy is anal intercourse with a women. The person who does the act is known as active agent and the person, on whom the act is done, is known as passive agent. if the passive agent is adult/elderly the act is known as Gerontophilia. If the passive agent in sodomy is a child, act is called Paederasty, the passive agent is labelled as catamite, and the active agent is known as Paedophile. Examination findings of sodomy are :- In active agent : (i) Peculiar smell of anal gland secretion on penis, (ii) Fecal soiling, lubricant (if used) and blood on penis, (iii) Penis shaft is elongated and constricted in habitual sodomites with consequent twisting/ angulation of urethra, (iv) Abrasions on prepuce and glans penis, tearing of frenulum, swelling and redness of penis. In passive agent : Passive agent may be :? 1) Habitual : (i) Funnel shaped anus with deeply situated anal opening, (ii) Dilatation and laxity of anal sphincter, (iii) Shaved anal skin, (iv) Anal fissures and piles, (v) Lateral buttock truction test positive: On applying lateral traction on anus in normal person, there will be reflex contraction of anus, but in habitual sodomine there is comple relaxation of sphincter with dilatation of opening. 2) Non-habitual (forcibly victimized) : (i) Presence of semen in anus is the only confirmatety evidence, (ii) Signs of violence around anus, i.e. abrasions, fisures, contusion or triangular bruised tear of posterior pa of anus (in sudden violence). Other unnatural sexual offences Bestiality : is the sexual intercourse by a human being with a lower animal. Tribadism (Lesbianism or female homosexuality) : Sexual gratification of a women is obtained by another woman by kissing, body contact, manipulation of breast and genitalia. Active paner is called dyke or butch and the passive agent is called femme. This is not an offence in India. o Buccal coitus (coitus per as/sin of gomorrah) : In this, the male organ is introduced into mouth, usually of a young child.

Ligature mark is an example of imprinted/pressure/patterned abrasion.ii) Under the ligature mark there is dry, white and glistening pad of fat.iii) There is dribbling of saliva from the angle of the mouth, which is confirmatory sign of antemortem hanging. This is due to irritation of submandibular and parotid glands by ligature.iv) There may be intimal tear of carotid arteries.v) In case of pressure of ligature on cervical sympathetic ganglia, the eye on that side is found open (La facie sympathique). It confirms antemortem hanging.vi) Fracture of hyoid is usually not seen (may be seen only in 10%). Fracture of thyroid cartilage (20-30% cases) and fracture of tracheal rings (5-10%) may be seen. There may be congestion and ecchymosis (hemorrhage) in trachea, larynx, epiglottis and esophagus.

There is an interference with the intracellular oxidative processes in the tissues and it kills by creating histotoxic or cytotoxic anoxia, although the blood may contain a normal oxygen content (588- Reddy 31st)"

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. B: Suicidal deaths Hesitation cuts derive their name from the hesitation with which these incisions are inflicted by a person intending to commit suicide by a cutting instrument. The preliminary cuts are known as tentative cuts Hesitation cuts are not found in homicidal assaults Hesitation/ tentative wounds They are defined either as: any cut or wound that is self-inflicted after a decision is made not to commit suicide, or any tentative cut or wound that is made before the final cut that causes death. Such wounds are usually superficial, sharp, forced skin cuts found on the body of victims. These less severe cutting marks are often caused by attempts to build up courage before attempting the final, fatal wound. Non-fatal, shallow hesitation wounds can also accompany the deeper, sometimes fatal incisions. Although hesitation cuts are not always present in cases of suicide, they are typical of suicidal injuries. However, the presence of hesitation marks alongside or near to the final fatal mark usually indicates a forensic diagnosis of suicide over other possible causes of death. Hesitation wounds are generally straight-line marks at the elbows, neck/throat, and wrists, although in a few cases they occur in the general area of the upper middle pa of the abdomen (near the hea). Wounds made by people attempting suicide are typically made at an angle related to the hand that holds the weapon. The angle of such hesitation wounds is usually in a downward flowing direction because of the natural motion of the arm as it sweeps across the body. Hesitation wounds are often made under clothing, with paicular pas of the clothing being paed to expose the target area of the body. Instruments used to inflict hesitation wounds are generally those found around the living quaers of the person attempting suicide. Such instruments include kitchen knives, single-edge and double-edge knifes, pocket knives, hatchets, razor blades, screwdrivers, and other sharp objects. People who have previously attempted suicide, but have not succeeded in their endeavor, will often carry visible scars from hesitation wounds."

Femur and tibia give more accurate values compared to humerus and radius Stature is determined in dismembered body (skeletal remains) by : Length from the tip of middle finger to the tip of opposite middle finger when arms are fully extended. Twice the length of one arm + 30 cm (of two clavicles) + 4 cm (for the sternum). Humerus length is 1/5th of height. The length from the veex to the symphysis pubis is half of the total length. The length from the sternal notch to Symphysis pubis x 3.3. The length of forearm measured from tip of middle finger is =5/19 of total length. The height of head measured by the veical distance from the top of the head (veex) to the tip of chin = 1/8 of the total length. The length of veebral column = 34/100 of total length. To the length of entire skeleton, add 2.5 to 4 cm for thickness of the soft pas. As a general rule humerus is 20%, tibia is 22%, femur is 27% and spine is 35% of individual height."

In shotgun these are lead shots and pellets (recently steel is also used instead of lead) and in rifled weapons (pistal, rifle, revolver), these are bullets. Tip of the bullet is knwon as nose. Varieties of bullets are :- Incendiary (igniting) bullet : The tip of bullet contains self igniting material e.g. barium nitrate and powdered aluminium and magnesium (in the past, phosphorus was used), so that it catches fire on hitting the target. It is used to cause fire in usually inflammable targets like fuel tanks (of air crafts etc). Explosive bullet : The tip contains a detonator or lead azide, so that the bullet explodes on hitting the target. Dum-dum bullet (expanding bullet): It is a jacketed bullet with is nose tip chiseled or cut off. It is designed to increase in diameter and expand upon striking the target, thus producing larger diameter wounds of limited penetration. Tandem bullet (Piggey tail bullet) : It is called one-behind-other bullet because two bullets are ejected one after the other, when first bullet failed to leave the burrel and is ejected by subsequently fired bullet. Therefore, both enter body through same enterance wound (some times, they may enter through different entries), but the wounds of exit are always two. Tandem (Duplex) caridge is one in which two bullets are present in same caridge. It is used in military rifles. Tracer bullet: It leaves a trace in atmosphere along the path so that a person (gunner) can observe the strike. Burning of barium nitrate produces flame and powdered magnesium along with strontium nitrate are added to give red color to the flame. Tumbling bullet : One that rotates in end on end during its motion. Yawning bullet : One which travels in an irregular fashion and causes a key hole entery wound. Yaw means detion between long axis of bullet and the axis of path of bullet. Souvenir bullet : A bullet left in body for long time and is surrounded by fibrous tissue. Frangile bullet : Designed to fragment upon impact. Mushrooming of bullet : A soft nose bullet, an hitting the target may get deformed to assume the shape of a mushroom."

With blood samples, a good HMWDNA recovery from all the bodies investigated was obtained during the first week following the death. In each case, the quality and quantity of the DNA were good enough to realizeDNA fingerprints with the SLP system (data not shown). In liver samples, only bodies of postmoem ages ranging from 1 to 7 days allowed us to obtain HMWDNA. HMWDNA was extracted from kidney samples up to one month after death, but the yield of DNA decreased rapidly, becoming very low beyond a period of one week. Past this period, we did not succeed in obtaining DNA fingerprints from DNA extracted. The extraction of DNA from lymph nodes was satisfactory up to one week. Over a postmoem period of 7 days, the DNA was degraded and unsuitable for blotting. HMWDNA was purified from spleen samples up to one week after death and the DNA present in hea tissue or in muscle cells was stable up to one month postmoem period, allowing us to perform DNA fingerprinting. Finally, out of all tissues tested, the brain coexappeared to be the most stable tissue for DNA recovery, even after long postmoem periods.\" Ref:MEDSCAPE"

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "It is woh learning the presentations of the common poisons listed in the answer choices, because a timely diagnosis can sometimes save a patient's life. The presentation of the teenager in the question is typical for salicylate poisoning, including poisoning with aspirin. Fatalities are typically due to dehydration and hypokalemia. In contrast to the acute toxicity of salicylates, acetaminophen poisoning produces nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and shock in some cases; it can cause irreversible hepatic failure (which can be prevented or ameliorated by administration of N-acetylcysteine) 2-6 days after ingestion. Carbon monoxide causes hypoxia, and a cherry red coloration of the lips and mucous membranes may be evident. Lead and mercury poisoning are both usually seen in their chronic forms, although mercury ingestion can produce an acute toxicity with renal tubular necrosis and necrosis of gastrointestinal epithelium. Chronic lead poisoning can cause anemia (with basophilic stippling of RBCs), neuropathy, and abdominal pain. Ref: Corbridge T., Murray P., Mokhlesi B. (2005). Chapter 102. Toxicology in Adults.

That is when there is excess air and warmth but no moisture (humidity), i.e. hot dry and windy climate, mummification takes place in place of normal putrefaction. Thus mummification occurs in deses, especially in summer and also in bodies buried in shallow grave in sandy soil. Mummification is characterized by dessication or drying of the dead body. There is drying, dehydration and shriveling of dead body. It proceeds from exterior to interior. Therefore first to be involved is skin, especially of exposed body pas like lips, nose tip, hands (fingers) and feet (toes). The skin is shrunken, contracted, dry, brittle, leathery, streched across bony prominences and rusty brown to black in color. Internal viscera also dry up, darken in color and blend with each other to form a single mass. Body emits smell like rotten cheese. Facial features and injuries are well preserved, thus identification of body and cause of death can be determined (like adipocere formation). Time required for mummification varies between 3 months - 2 years. If properly preserved, a mummified body can remain for years. Chronic arsenic or antimony poisoning or mummification.

FirearmsRifledSmooth-Bored* Bore is having a number of spiral grooving, which runs parallel to each other but are twisted spirally* Rifling causes bullet to rotate or spin about longitudinal axisQ* Spinning gives gyroscopic stability to the bullet. This increases the accuracy and also imparts greater power of penetrationQ * Example: Rifle, revolver, pistol etc* Interior of the barrel is smoothQ* When the entire barrel from breech to muzzle is of the same diameter it is called as cylinder bore* When the distal 7-10 cm is narrowed, this is known as choking or choke-boreQ.* Some smooth barreled firearms have small portion of their bore near the muzzle end rifled, which are called as 'paradox guns'Q* Example: Shotgun, musket, country made guns"

Back spatter: In a contact shot, the muzzle blast and negative pressure in the barrel may suck blood, hair, fragments of tissues and cloth fibers back into the barrel. Blowback phenomenon: Cruciate, stellate or ragged laceration is seen, especially if there is a thick bone immediately under the skin, such as the skull. This occurs as a result of expansion of gases beneath the skin and their exit through the entry wound (in contact wounds)."

Normally the chloride content is equal in the right and left chambers of the heart (600 mg/100 ml). In fresh water drowning due to hemodilution the chloride content is decreased and in salt water drowning due to hemoconcentration the chloride content is increased in left side of heart. A 25% difference in chloride is significant but the test is of doubtful value.o Limitations of gettler test:-1. No value in atypical drowning; congenital cardiac defects as shunts and patent foramen ovale; and if drowning medium contains same amount of chloride.2. There is progressive loss of Cl- from blood after death. Therefore the test has to be made within a reasonably short time after death."

    "explanation": "Ans. B: Lightning stroke An almost pathognomonic cutaneous feature of lightning stroke is known as feathering/lightning prints/ Arborescent/ Filigree burns It comprises of linear, fernlike, superficial skin markings (also called keraunographic marks) that may disappear after 1-2 days. These cutaneous manifestations of lightning injury usually consist of erythematous streaks that do not blanch on diascopy. They are usually found over the shoulders or the flanks. Erythema begins to fade in 4-6 hours with no residual skin changes. This bizarre cutaneous manifestation is probably related to the flashover phenomenon, from the transmission of static electricity along the superficial vasculature. Recognition of this sign may save the life of an unaccompanied comatose patient and should signal the need for immediate resuscitation if a victim is not breathing and has no pulse. Joule burn (electric mark) is specific and diagnostic of contact with electricity and is found at the entry of the current."

Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin. Samples to be preserved for chemical analysis * Blood * Routine viscera * Lung * Brain * Hea * Spleen is considered as best specimen due to presence of more RBCs.

The face is pale due to cerebral ischemia or vagal inhibition. The eyes are frequently protruded and firmer than ususal due to congestion. Conjunctivae are congested. The eyes are closed or partially open, the pupils are usually dilated. If the ligature knot presses on the cervical sympathetic, the eye on the same side may remain open and its pupil dilated, It indicates antemortem hanging (He facie sympathique)\".Additional Educational points:# Lynching is homicidal hanging.

If the two patterns match, the possibility of error, i.e. the chance that they do not belong to the same individual may be less than one in 30 billion.

Phosphine is a protoplasmic poison interfering with enzymes and protein synthesis. In animal studies, phosphine has been shown to cause non-competitive inhibition of cytochrome oxidase of myocardial mitochondria Autopsy Findings * Typical garlicky odor * Congested organs * Bright fluid blood * Pleural effusion * Pulmonary edema * sub endocardial infarct,myocarditis * Bleeding diathesis * Gastric mucosa shows shedding * Kidney shows acute tubular necrosis * Liver shows fatty change, congestion, edema, inflammatory infiltrate in poal tract and centrizonal necrosis.

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Incised wound LACERATIONS (Tear or Rupture)* Lacerations are tears or splits of skin, mucous membrane and underlying tissue (e.g., muscle or internal organs). Lacerations are produced by application of blunt force to broad area of the body, which crush or stretch tissues beyond the limits of their elasticity. Localized portions of tissue are displaced by the impact of the blunt force, which sets up traction forces and causes tearing of tissues. Features of lacerations arei) Hair and hair bulb, nerves and blood vessels are crushed - There may be paralysis (nerve crushed) and hemorrhage is not pronounced (blood vessels crushed).ii) Site of injury is the site of impact.iii) Shape of injury is irregular, margins are irregular and contused/abraded and show tags of tissue.iv) Size of injury does not corresponds to impacting surface.* There are following types of laceration: -1) Split laceration: Splitting occurs by crushing of skin between two hard objects. Blunt force on areas where the skin is close to rigid structures like bone with scanty subcutaneous tissue, may produce a wound that by linear splitting of tissue may look like incised wound, i.e., incised like or incised looking wound. Examples of such area are scalp, eye brows, cheek bones (zygomatic), lower jaw, iliac crest, perineum and skin. A wound produced by a fall on knee or elbow with limb flexed and by a sharp stone also simulates incised wound.2) Strech lacerations: Overstretching of the skin, if it is fixed, will cause laceration, for example, by kicking, sudden deformity of bone occurs after fracture, making it compound.3) Avulsion (shearing laceration): An avulsion is a laceration produced by sufficient force (shearing force) delivered at an acute angle to detach (tear off) a portion of a traumatized surface or viscus from its attachment, the shearing and grinding force by a weight. Flaying is type of avulsion in which shearing and grinding force by weight (such as of lorry wheel passing over a limb) may produce avulsion (separation of skin from underlying tissue/degloving of a large area).4) Tears: Tears of the skin and tissues can occur from imact by a against irregular or semi-sharp objects, such as door handle of a car. This is another form of overstretching.5) Cut laceration: Cut lacerations may be produced by a heavy sharp edged instrument."

Decalcification and destruction of bone.3. Production of insoluble salts--calcium and magnesium fluoride.These effects result in hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia On Dermal exposure: * Severe pain * Hydrofluoric acid readily penetrates the skin and mucous membranes, causing deep tissue destruction On ingestion:Severe, burning pain followed by retching and vomiting. Systemic fluoride toxicity may result in severe hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Treatment: Topical Skin Therapy: Local application of 2.5% calcium gluconate gel is the treatment of choice.Systemic: IV calcium & Magnesium sulfate until the normal levels are reached in blood."

Hemoperfusion is the technique of passing blood through a bed of paicles contained within a device to which blood lines and a blood pump are attached. It differs from hemodialysis in that blood comes in direct contact with the membrane coated sorbent paicle and not a continuous dialysis membrane, from plasma pharesis in that no plasma is separated from blood. Clinical indications of hemoperfusion: Poisoning (drug and chemical exposure), hepatic failure (drug induced, fulminant hepatic failure), treatment of uremia and its complications (aluminium toxicity). Poisoning by water soluble drugs such as lithium and chemicals which cause acidosis (methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylate) are best treated with hemodialysis.

They have silicaceous cell wall (i.e. cell wall contains silica) which resist acid digestion and putrefaction. Only live body with a circulation can transport diatoms form lung to brain, bone marrow, muscles etc. So, presence of diatoms in brain and bone marrow indicates death due to drowning. For detection of diatoms, bone marrow of long bones, e.g. femur, tibia, humerus or sternum is highly suitable and reliable. As diatoms resist acid digestion, to extract them acid digestion techinique is used. Diatoms test is negative in dead bodies thrown in water and in dry drowning. However, diatoms test is invalid, if deceased had drunk this water before submersion or species of diatoms do not match with specimen from the site of drowning."

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Cooling of body ALGOR MOIS After death, dead body behaves like an ine substance and therefore, if atmospheric temperature is low, body loses its heat by conduction, covection, radiation and evoporation, so as to attain the atmospheric temperature, i.e. the body cools. No cooling of dead body occurs if atmospheric temperature is higher than that of body. Cooling of body stas 1/2 to 1 hour after death. There are varying opinions about rate of cooling of dead body: i) Most widely accepted view is that the rate of cooling in india (tropical countries) is 0.5-0.7deg C/hour, so that body attains atmospheric temperature in 16-20 hours after death. In temperate climate, the rate of fall is about 1.5deg C/hour. ii) As per another view, cooling is faster in initial period, when the temprature difference between body and atmosphere is maximum ? First 30-45 minutes --> No temperature fall (isothermic phase). First 1-6 hours --4 1.5-2deg C/hour. 6-12 hours 0.9-1.2deg C/hour. After 12 hours ---> 0.4-0.6deg C/hour. iii) Rate of cooling is related to difference in temperature and its surroundings (environment). In the first 2 hours average rate fall of temperature is roughly half this difference. In next 2 hours the temperature fall is at half this rate and in subsequent 2 hours, at quaer this rate. iv) Most common site for recording temperature is the rectum. Thermameter is inseed in rectum around 8-10 cm for 2 minutes. Other sites for recording tempeure are nose, ear (external auditory meatus), vagina and under liver. Medicolegal impoance of algor mois - i) It is a sign of death. ii) Time since death may be determined and and algor mois is the most impoant indicator to determine the time since death during first 24 hours."

Ferrchelatase* It causes hemolysis Chronic Poisoning* Called as plumbisim, saturnism* Myalgia* Paraesthesia* Fatigue* Irritability* Abdominal discomfo/pain* Ahralgia* Tremor* Headache* Anorexia* Vomiting* Weight loss* Facial pallor - especially around the mouth (circum-oral pallor) is considered as consistent sign of chronic lead poisoning. It is due to vasospasm in addition to anemia * Anemia - is due to impairment in heme synthesis and is hypochromic and microcytic type anemia. There is reduced erythrocyte life span* Blood - there are immature red cells in circulation such as reticulocytes and basophilic stippled cells. Basophilic stippling or punctate basophilia means presence of many dark coloured pinhead sized spots in the cytoplasm of red blood cells. The spots are aggregation of ribonucleic acid (RNA) due to inhibition of the enzyme pyrimidine-5' nucleotidase that normally eliminates degraded RNA.* Lead line (Buonian line) - a bluish line is present on gums. The line formation is due to lead sulphide. Lead sulphide is formed due to action of hydrogen sulphide gas, liberated from the decomposed food in the mouth, with lead.* Colic and constipation (dry belly ache) - Colic affects intestine, ureter or uterus. The attack of colic lasts for few minutes and is in form of severe, intermittent cramps.During colic, the abdominal wall is rigid and contracted. Constipation is associated with the colic.* Lead palsy - is a late phenomenon. The extensor muscles are paralyzed causing wrist drop or foot drop. It is motor type of paralysis. The motor paralysis is due to:1. Interference with phosphocreatine metabolism2. Peripheral neuropathy.* Lead encephalopathy - it is more common in children and presents with sudden onset of vomiting, irritability, headache, ataxia, veigo, convulsions and coma.* Hypeension* Aeriosclerotic nephritis* Amenorrhea* Sterility* Aboion.

Principle: Blood serum contains proteins in colloidal suspension ,and when human serum is injected into an animal,the animal become immunised against these proteins and antibodies develop in its blood .If human serum is then brought into contact with this animal serum,the antibodies in the animal serum react with the proteins in the human serum and a visible precipitate forms. The antibodies causing this reaction are known as precipitins and the animal serum is known as antihumam precipitin serum.A rabbit or a fowl is injected with human blood every third day for 3 to 5 injections. after thuis animal is killed and the antiserum is collected. A suitable antiserum should react immmediately or within a minute on the 1:1000 dilution Application of the test: It is a specific protein test, and the reaction demonstrates the presence of albuminous substances obtained from any pa of human body. the origin of skin, flesh,bone or even secretions such as saliva ,milk and semen is determined by this test."

Mechanism of Action BAL has two SH (thiol) groups. The two SH group binds to those metals that produce toxicity by interacting with sulfhydryl containing enzymes in the body. BAL will combine with these metals forming BAL-metal complex thus dislodge the metal from acting site. Indications BAL is useful against metals that interfere with sulfhydryl enzymes in the body such as arsenic, mercury, bismuth, copper, antimony, and nickel. Contraindications BAL is contraindicated in iron and cadmium poisoning because BAL-iron and BAL-cadmium complex are toxic. Dose BAL is administered intramuscularly as 5 mg/kg stat followed by 2 to 3 mg/kg every 4 to 8 hours for two days and then once a day for 10 days.

In tropical countries (e.g. india), it begins 1-2 hours after death, takes further 2 hours to develop, and lasts for 18-36 hours in summer and 24-48 hours in winter.o In temperate countries, it begins in 3-6 hours, takes further 2-3 hours to develop and lasts for 2-3 days.o All muscles of body are involved, i .e. voluntary or involuntary.o However, it does not start in all muscles simultaneously (nysten's rule).o Involuntary muscles (heart) are involved first than voluntary muscles.o Sequence of muscles involvement is as follows : Heart > upper eyelid > neck > jaw > face > chest > upper limb > abdomen > lower limb > finger and toes.o It passes off in the same order in which it has appeared.Note:o Cadaveric spasm is not natural stiffening. It is defined as the condition wherein a group of muscles, which were in contraction or spasm at the time of death, continue to be in spasm even after death, without the stage of primary relaxation. It does not occur in all deaths (unlike rigor mortis, which occurs in all deaths)."

Fissured fractures are seen radiating from the defect. Irregular lacerations may be seen involving the leptomeninges. Pieces of bone from the wound of entry are often driven into the cranial cavity and may establish the bullet track. At the point of exit a punched out opening is produced in the inner table and beveled opening in the outer table. The wound is funnel shaped with the funnel opening in the direction in which the bullet is travelling both in entrance and exit wound.

A) Forced diuresis with or without alteration of urinary pH Diuresis and ion trapping alteration of urinary pH may prevent the renal reabsorption of poisons that under go excretion by glomerular filteration and active tubular secretion. Forced diuresis may be of following types :? 1) Alkaline diuresis : Poisons which are trapped and excreted in alkaline urine are barbiturates (phenobarbitone), chlorpropamide, diffunisol, sulfonamides and salicylates. 2) Acid diuresis : It is done for amphetamines, cocaine, strychnine, phencyclidine, quinidine, quinine, chloroquine, TCA and tocainide. 3) Saline diuresis : It is useful for alcohol, thallium, bromide, lithium, fluoride, chromium, potassium and isoniazide. B) Extracorporal removal therapies These are peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion (resin or charcol), hemofiltration, plasmapheresis and exchange transfusion. Commonly used procedures are :? 1) Haemodialysis : It is useful in poisoning with alcohol (ethanol and methanol), aspirin (salicylates), acetone, atenolol, acetaminophen, barbiturates (phenobarbitone), bromide, boric acid, chloral hydrate, ethylene glycol, fluoride, lithium, trivalent arsenic, procainamide, theophylline, thiocyanate, sodium chlorate and sotalol. Hemodialysis is not useful in copper sulphate, benzodiazepines, organophosphates, kerosine and digitalis poisonings. In all poisonings, where hemodialysis is indicated peritoneal dialysis is also used with one more indication of mercury poisoning. 2) Hemoperfusion (chorcol or resin) : It is used in acetaminophen, barbiturates carbamazepine, chloral hydrate, caffeine, CC14, chloramphenical, phenytoin, procainamide, salicylates, theophylline, valproate, dapsone and methotrexate."

There are clean cut edges and hesitation cuts are seen. Incised wound It is a clean cut through the tissues (usually, skin and subcutaneous tissue), caused by sharp-edged object, which is longer than its depth, when the weapon is struck or pressed and drawn across the body pa, i.e., there is pressure and friction. Examples of sharp edged object are knife, blade, razor, scalpel, sword, chopper etc. The characteristic features of incised wound are : Length is the greatest dimension (most impoant). Hair, hair bulb, nerve and vessels are cut bleeding is profuse as vessels are cut. Width of injury is more than the thickness of blade, due to gaping of wound. Langer's line of skin determines gaping : gaping is more when cut is across these lines. Margins are eveed, clear, and clean cut. Clean incised wounds heal by primary intention, whereas diy, infected or large wounds heal by secondary intention, with scar formation. Hesitation cuts (Tentative cuts or trial cuts) are characteristic features of suicidal attempt. Incised wound on nose, ear and genital are usually homicidal and are inflicted on account of jealously or revenge in case of adultery, causing disfiguration."

Sexual intercourse with wife, aged less than 18 yrs, is now an offence (rape). 2. Section 375 IPC, Exception 2, has been struck down by Supreme court (i.e. sexual intercourse of man with wife above than 15 yrs is not an offence). 3. Age of consent for sexual intercourse a. Unmarried female - 18 yrs b. Married female - 18 yrs (if the female 15 = 18 yrs is not complaining against the husband, it does not make the act lawstaful) 4. The wife (15 - 18 yrs) should file the complaint within 1 yr from incident. 5. Marital rape is not punishable in India.

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient with a positive history of working in a factory and now having presented with the classical symptoms (excessive salivation, tremors, disturbed personality and blue lines on gums) points towards the diagnosis of chronic mercury poisoning. The mercury poisoning can occur from various mercuric compounds. They are Mercuric chloride, Mercuric oxide, Mercuric oxide, Mercuric cyanide, Mercuric sulphide, Mercuric nitrite, Mercuric sulphate, Mercurous chloride, Sulphate of mercury, Ammoniomercuric chloride and organic compunds of mercury. Elemental mercury is found in glass thermometers, electrical switches, fluorescent light bulbs, older dental fillings and few medical equipments. Inorganic mercury is found in batteries, chemistry labs, disinfectants, folk culture medicines and red cinnabar mineral. Organic mercury is found in older germ-killers (antiseptics), thimerosal, fumes from burning coal and in a few fishes that have consumed organic mercury. Mercury poisoning can occur as acute poisoning or chronic poisoning. The mercuric ion tends to bind with the sulphydryl groups of cellular proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids and mitotic apparatus thus interferes with the cellular and enzymatic functions. Renal tubular function get affected and in the pas of the central nervous system that are mainly targeted are cerebellum, basal ganglia, temporal lobe and corpus callosum. In acute poisoning the symptoms are bronchitis, constriction in throat, hoarse voice, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, fibrosis, abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, blood stained diarrhea, glossitis, ulcerative gingivitis, renal tubular necrosis, cylinduria, uraemia and acidosis. Chronic mercury poisoning is also known as hydrargyrism. The common symptoms are sore mouth, gingivitis, salivation, formation of blue lines at the junction with teeth (Buonian line), Danbury tremors, Glass blower's shakes (hatter's shakes), Concussio mercurialis, Mercurial erethism, Mercuria lentis (brownish deposition of mercury on anterior lens capsule) and Acrodynia or pink disease.

Its affinity for hemoglobin is 250 times greaterthan that of 02- It therefore binds to hemoglobin and reduces the 02-carrying capacity of blood.> The symptoms of poisoning are due to tissue hypoxia; they progress from headache and fatigue to confusion, syncope, tachycardia, coma, convulsions, shock, respiratory depression, and cardiovascular collapse.> Carboxyhemoglobin levels below 15% rarely produce symptoms; above 40%, symptoms become severe. Treatment includes establishment of an airway, supportive therapy, and administration of 100% O2.> Sulfur dioxide, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide are mucous membrane and respiratory irritants. Methane is a simple asphyxiant.> PATHOPHYSIOLOGYFig: Carbon monoxide shifts the oxygen-haemoglobin saturation curve to the left and changes it to a more hyperbolic shape. Less oxygen is available for the tissues. Shown is the oxygen diffusion gradient difference at 50% saturation> Carbon monoxide has 210 times greater affinity for haemoglobin than oxygen. A small environmental concentration will thus cause toxic levels of carboxyhaemoglobin.> After the carbon monoxide has selectively bound to haemoglobin the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve of the remaining oxyhaemoglobin shifts to the left, reducing oxygen release.> The affinity of carbon monoxide for myoglobin is even greater than for haemoglobin. Bindin g to cardiac myoglobin causes myocardial depression, hypotension and arrhythmias.> Cardiac decompensation results in further tissue hypoxia and is ultimately the cause of death.> Carbon monoxide has a predilection for 'watershed' areas of the brain where there is a meagre blood supply.> Basal ganglia, with their high oxygen consumption, are most often affected. Other commonly affected areas are the cerebral white matter, hippocampus and cerebellum."

The cavity created is many times larger than the diameter of the bullet with maximum point of expansion occurring at the point where the bullet is traveling sideways (greatest degree of jaw).Size and configuration of temporary cavity is affected by:Kinetic energy lost by bulletType of tissue along the tract (elastic vs non elastic eg bone)Amount of energy transferred is given by theformulaKE = 1/2 MV2It shows that velocity rather than weight plays a greater role in determining the kinetic energy possessed by the bullet.Bullets fired from handguns are propelled by low velocity, have 1owt energy (50-100 J) and result in low energy transfer wounds characterized by injuries confined to wound tractRifle bullets are high velocity high energy (2000-3000 J) have potential to cause high energy transfer wounds producing temporary cavity"

Nephritis is a serious complication. Mercuria lentis - discolouration of the capsule of lens as observed through slit lamp is one of the early symptoms of chronic mercury poisoning. Tremors (sometimes called Danbury tremors) are moderately coarse & is interspersed by jerky movements. The advanced condition is k/a Hatter's or glass blower's shakes because they are common in persons working in gloss-blowing & hat industries. The most severe form is known as concussio mercurialis in which no activity is possible. Erethism is a peculiar disturbance of the personality characterised by shyness, irritability, tremors, loss of memory & insomnia. It is common in workers in mirror industry.

Ring fracture of foramen magnum with lumbar spine injury (Ref: Ready 33/e p247; Parikh's 6/4.94-4.97)\"Ring fracture: This term is commonly used to signify any fracture around the foramen magnum. Technically it means a fissured fracture about 3.5 cm outside the foramen magnum at the back, involving middle ear sideways and roof of nose anteriorly. It is rare and usually requires a lot of force to produce. It results from fall from a height on feet or buttocks, sudden violent turn of head on spine, severe blow on the vertex which drives the skull downwards on the vertebral column or heavy blow directed underneath the occiput or chin. \"Ring or Foramen FracturesIt is fissured fracture, which encircles the skull in such a manner that the anterior third is separated at its junction with the middle and posterior third.But usually the term is applied to a fracture, which runs at about 3 to 5 cm outside the foramen magnum at the back and sides of the skull, and passes forwards through the middle ears and roof of the nose, due to which the skull is separated from the spine.They are rare and occur after falls from a height on to the feet or buttocks.QSkull-vault fractureType of fractureDescriptionDiastatic fracture(sutural fractures)* Separation of suturesQ* Occurs only in young persons due to blow with blunt weapon or from cerebral edemaQFissured fracture* A linear fracture or crack involving the outer or inner table or both.* Fracture only involving inner table cannot be detected on X-ray. It can be detected at autopsyDepressed fracture* Caused by a heavy weapon with a small striking surface e.g., hammer* Its shape may indicate the type of weapon with which it is produced. It is therefore called as signature fractureQ.Comminuted fracture* It has stellate appearance when there is no displacement of fragments.* Also called spider web fractureQPond fracture* Occurs in children due to elasticity of their bones* Also called indented fracturesQGutter fracture* When a part of thickness of bone is removed to form a gutter e.g., glancing oblique bullet woundsQElevated fracture* Result from a blow of moderately heavy sharp edge weapon e.g., axe which elevate one end of bone above the surface while other end may dip down to injured duraQRing fracture* Any fracture around the foramen magnumQ"

Again permanent does not mean that it should be incurableQ. For example, when loss of sight is due to corneal opacity due to some injury, it is curable by corneoplasty. But as because corneal opacity is permanent by itself it will be considered grevious huQ & chances of cure by corneoplasty does not minimize its gravity-Apurba Nandy 2/e P-203. Abrasion heals completely without leaving any disfiguration or deformity of hence its a simple injuryQ. Contusion of scalp does not produce permanent disfiguration as it reves to normal in few weeks. - Contrary to popular belief, a simple stay in hospital for 20 days or deliberately delaying the healing of simple hu by patient for 20 days do not constitute grevious injury. And a stay of < 20 days (even with bodily pain) is not considered a grevious injury. Grevious hu is a cognizable offence for which a police officer can arrest a person without a warrant from magistrateQ. Punishment for voluntarily causing simple (non grevious) hu on provocation with simple (non dangerous) weapon is imprisonment extending upto 1 month and/or fine upto Rs. 500/- or bothQ.

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Ans. C: Hypothermia Cocaine when ingested results in hypehermia, hallucinations, euphoria and stimulation of libido Cocaine intoxication With excessive or prolonged use, the drug can cause itching, tachcardia, hallucinations and paranoid delusions. Overdoses cause tachyarrythmias and a marked elevation of blood pressure, which can be life-threatening. Toxicity results in seizures, followed by respiratory and circulatory depression of medullar origin. This may lead to death from respiratory failure, stroke, or hea-failure. Cocaine is also highly pyrogenic, because the stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production. Heat loss is inhibited by the intense vasoconstriction. Cocaine-induced hypehermia may cause muscle cell destruction and myoglobinuria resulting in renal failure. Emergency treatment often consists of administering a benzodiazepine sedation agent, such as diazepam to decrease the elevated hea rate and blood pressure. Physical cooling (ice, cold blankets, etc.) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used to treat hypehermia There is no officially approved specific antodote for cocaine overdose Cocaine's primary acute effect on brain chemistry is to raise the amount of dopamine and serotonin in the nucleus accumbens (the pleasure center in the brain); this effect ceases, due to metabolism of cocaine to inactive compounds and paicularly due to the depletion of the transmitter resources (tachyplaxis). This can be experienced acutely as feelings of depression, as a \"crash\" after the initial high."

Heat cramps/Miner's cramps/Stoker's cramp/Firemen's cramp These are painful spasm of voluntary muscles which follow sternous work in a hot atmosphere. These are caused by loss of water and salt in profuse prespiration (sweating). 2. Heat exhaustion/heat collapse/heat syncope/heat prostration There is collapse without any elevation of body tempetature. It occurs due to exposure to high temperature in closed environment and is precipitated by muscular exercise and unsuitable clothing. There is extreme exhaustion with peripheral vascular collapse with scanty prespiration (sweating). 3. Heat stroke (heat hyperpyrexia/sunstroke) it is due to failure of heat regulating mechanism caused by failure of cutaneous circulation and sweating. It occurs due to exposure to heat in open and humid environment. There is sudden collapse with loss of consciousness. Skin is dry, hot flushes and there is no sweating. All signs of shock are present, i.e. low urine out put, low BP, rapid irregular pulse etc."

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Sulph-meth Hb Signs of putrefactiono The signs and effects of putrefaction are as followsColour changesThe earliest sign of decomposition is greenish discoloration of body, seen in right iliac fossa externally and under liver internally. This is due to involvement of caecum. Which contains more liquid and is full of bacteria. In these areas, it appears in 12-18 hours and slowly spreads to whole body in 24-48 hours. Greenish discoloration is due to formation of sulph-meth-haemoglobin,Morbling occurs when Hb dissociates from RBCs and the colour of Hb is taken up by vessels, which are seen as prominent lines having purple or green or brown colour. Marbling occurs in 24-48 hours.Formation of foul smelling gasesDue to action of bacteria, foul smelling gases are formed, e.g. SO., H^S, ammonia, methane and CO,.Effects of gasesBloating up of body occurs in 34-48 hours. At the same time following changes occurs :i) Appearance of stomach contents and froth on nose and mouth.ii) Degloving and destocking with appearance of putrifactive blisters,iii) Emptying of heart due to pressure of gas.In 48-72 hours prolapse of rectum and uterus occur and postmortem delivery may occur if the dead woman is pregnant. Color of postmortem staining also changes to brown and finally to black. False rigidity (putrefactive rigidity ) may occur at this time.Appearance of maggotsFlies lay their eggs in wrounds, exposed natural orifices and exposed moist parts of the body and folds of skin, e.g. neck, axilla, nostrils, mouth etc. Flies lay eggs in 6-12 hours after death and these eggs change in larva (maggot) in 1 -2 days. Thus maggots appear in 2-3 days after the death. After further 4-5 days, the maggots change into pupa, which convert into adult flies in next 3-5 days. Thus adult flies will be coming out of the body after total 8-12 days of death. Thus appearance of maggot determine the time since death.Other late changesIn 3-5 days : Nails and teeth become loose and can be pulled out, sutures of skull may separate.In 7-12 days: Liquefaction of body (colliquative putrefaction) occurs.In 1-3 months : Skeletonization of dead body occurs.Finally: Bones also decompose : Exposed bones in 1-5 years and deep burried bone (> 2 meters) in 25-100 years.Internal changesLiver becomes spongy and is called as foamy or Swiss cheese or honeycombed liver.In 7-12 days lequefaction of internal organs occur.Floatation of body (if body is in water)Floatation of body occurs due to accumulation of sufficient putrefactive gases. Abdomen is above (due to gases) and spine is below during floatation. Time required for floatation is ordinarily 24 hours after death in summers and 2-3 days in winter. Factors affecting floatation are :-i) Causing early floatation : Newborn mature infant, females, in summer, clothed body, obese, in sea water and in still pond wrater.ii) Causing delayed floatation : Still birth/i immature newrbom, male, in winter, naked body, thin built, in fresh water and in running stream water.o inspiration and expiration before death has no effect on floatation as floatation is due to putrefactive gases (not due to respiratory air)."

    "explanation": "Ans. C: Phenobarbitone poisoning Forced osmotic diuresis using intravenous chlohiazide and/ or mannitol results in considerable increase in the elimination rate of barbiturates Forced diuresis It is increased urine formation by diuretics and fluid It may enhance the excretion of ceain drugs in urine and is used to treat drug overdose or poisoning of these drugs and hemorrhagic cystitis Most of the drugs are either weak acids or weak bases. When urine is made alkaline, elimination of acidic drugs in the urine is increased. The converse applies for alkaline drugs. This method is only of therapeutic significance where the drug is excreted in active form in urine and where the pH of urine can be adjusted to levels above or below the pK value of the active form of drug. For acidic drugs, urine pH should be above the pK value of that drug, and converse for the basic drugs. It is because the ionization of acidic drug is increased in alkaline urine and ionized drugs cannot easily cross plasma membrane so cannot re-enter blood from kidney tubules. This method is ineffective for drugs which are strongly protein bound (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants) or which have a large apparent volume of distribution (e.g. paracetamol, tricyclic antidepressants). Forced alkaline diuresis has been used to increase the excretion of acidic drugs like salicylates and phenobarbitone, while forced acid diuresis has been used to enhance the elimination of cocaine, amphetamine, quinine, quinidine, strychnine when poisoning by these drugs has occurred. For forced alkaline diuresis, a diuretic like furosemide is given intravenously and sodium bicarbonate is added to the infusion fluid to make blood and, in turn, urine alkaline. Potassium replacement becomes of utmost impoance in this setting because potassium is usually lost in urine. If blood levels of potassium are depleted below normal levels, then hypokalemia occurs, which promotes bicarbonate ion retention and prevents bicarbonate excretion, thus interfering with alkalinization of the urine. For forced acid diuresis, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is used. Ammonium chloride has also been used for forced acid diuresis but it is a toxic compound. Forced alkaline diuresis is also recommended for rhabdomyolysis"

This test is falsely positive in putrefaction (due to putrefied gases) or in cases of attempted artificial respiration.Werdin's test:* Before birth middle ear contains gelatinous embryonic tissue which is replaced by air after respiration."

    "explanation": "LEAD Chronic Poisoning (plumbism; saturnism) Signs and Symptoms :- (1) Facial Pallor : The facial pallor paicularly about the mouth is one of the earliest and most consistent sign. It seems to be due to vasospasm. (2) Anaemia : There may be polycythaemia with polychromatophilia in early stages, but later there is anaemia which is associated with polychromasia, punctate basophilia, reticulocytosis, poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, nucleated red cells (sideroblasts) and an increase in mononuclear cells, whereas polymorphonuclear cells and platelets are decreased. The anaemia is probably due to decreased survival time of red blood cells and inhibition of haeme synthesis by interference with the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin. Punctate basophilia or basophilic stippling means the presence of many dark blue-coloured pinhead- sized spots in the cytoplasm of red blood cells, due to toxic action of lead on porphyrin metabolism. Reticulocytes and basophilic stippled cells result from the inhibition of 5 pyrimidine nucleotidase, an impaired ability to rid the cell of RNA degradation products and the aggregation of ribosome. (3) Line : A stippled blue line, called Buonian line, is seen on the gums. It appears due to subepithelial deposit of granules at the junction with teeth, only near diy or carious teeth, within a week of exposure, especially on upper jaw. It is due to formation of lead sulphide by the action of hydrogen sulphide formed by decomposed food in the mouth. (4) Colic and Constipation : It is usually later symptom. Colic of intestines, ureters, uterus and blood vessels occur in 85% of cases. The colic occurs at night and the pain may be very severe. Constipation is usual but diarrhoea or vomiting may occur. (5) Lead Palsy: It usually occurs late, and is seen in less than 10% of cases. There may be tremors, numbness, hyperaesthesia, and cramps before the actual muscle weakness. It is commoner in adults than in children, and men are paicularly affected. The muscle groups affected are those most prone to fatigue. Usually the extensor muscles of the wrist (wrist drop; radial nerve is affected) are affected, but the deltoid, biceps, anterior tibial (foot drop), and rarely muscles of eye or intrinsic muscles of hand or foot are affected. The paralysis is associated with degeneration of the nerve and atrophy of the muscles. Recovery may be complete but is usually slow. ( 6) Encephalopathy : It is common in children often associated with tetraethyl lead. The symptoms are vomiting, headache, insomnia, visual disturbances, irritability, restlessness, delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, coma and death. Lead encephalopathy is usually irreversible and about 85% have permanent brain damage. Death occurs in about 25% cases. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-544,545"

Injuries in explosion occur due to four factorsBlast or shock waveWhen an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the enviomment in which blast occursAir blast (most common) : Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other parts injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected.Under water blast (explosion under water) : Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured.Solid blast: Explosive is detonated near a rigid-'solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal. fracture of legs and vertebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung.Flame or hot gasesBums or burning of body may occur.Flying missiles (debris)Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations.AnoxiaVarious gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO2"

Infanticide in India is considered equivalent to murder and is tried under section 302IPC. Law considers every child as born dead and therefore in a case of infanticide, it has to be proved that the child was born alive and was then killed. Thus the first question in the investigation of a case of infanticide is, whether the child was still born or dead born or whether it was born live.* Still born : A still-born child is one which is born after 28 weeks of pregnancy and did not show sign of life after being completely born (i.e. he remains still -> so still birth). Child was alive in utero just before delivery but died during the process of birth.* Abortion refers to expulsion of the product of conception at any period of gestation before full term. Abortions may be1) Natural (spontaneous/accidental) abortion : Occurs naturally or spontaneously without any intervention.2) Artificial abortion : It occurs as results of direct interference with the pregnancy. Artificial abortion mayi) Legal (justifiable) abortion : It comes under medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) act.ii) Criminal abortion : It is illegal."

It occurs rapidly in bodies submerged in water than in damp soil. iii. Bacterial infection: Early activity by anerobes such as Clostridium perfringens assist in the reaction, as the bacteria produce lecithinase which facilitates hydrolysis and hydrogenation. iv. Built: In obese people and mature newborn, it is formed quickly. v. Age: Fetuses < 7 months do not show adipocere formation. vi. Air current: It retards adipocere formation by evaporation of the body fluid, and by reducing the body temperature. vii.Running water: Adipocere formation is retarded as the electrolytes are washed away from the surface of the body which is necessary for the change."

It may be: (1) Anoxic anoxia: In this type, oxygen cannot reach the blood, because of lack of oxygen in the lungs. This occurs: (a) from breathing in a contaminated atmosphere, e.g., from exposure to the fumes in wells and tanks, or from exposure to sewer gas, (b) from mechanical interference with the passage of air into or down the respiratory tract, e.g., in smothering, choking, hanging, strangulation, drowning, traumatic asphyxia and ceain forms of acute poisoning. (2) Anaemic anoxia: In this type, oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced, e.g., acute massive haemorrhage, poisoning by carbon monoxide, chlorates, nitrates, coaltar derivatives. (3) Stagnant anoxia: In this type, impaired circulation results in a reduction of oxygen delivery to the tissues, e.g., hea failure, embolism and shock. ( 4) Histotoxic anoxia: In this type, the enzymatic processes by which the oxygen in the blood is used by the tissues are blocked, e.g., acute cyanide poisoning. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-137"

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Ans. a. Root transparency Gustafson's Method The age estimation of adult over 21 years depends on the physiologic age changes in each of the dental tissues. AttritionQ Due to wear and tear from mastication, occlusal (upper) surface of the teeth is destroyed gradually; first involving the enamel, then dentin, and at last, pulp is exposed in the old age. It depends on the functional use of the teeth and also up on the hardness ParadentosisQ Regression of the gums and periodontal tissues surrounding the teeth takes place in the advancing age, gradually exposing the necks and adjacent pas of the roots, due to which the teeth become loose and fall off. Poor oral hygiene increases paradentosis. Secondary DentinQ * It may develop from the walls within the pulp cavity, and decrease the size of the cavity. * First it is deposited at the pulp chamber and gradually extends downwards to the apex, and may completely fill the pulp cavity. Cementum Appositiondeg The cementum increases in thickness paicularly due to changes in the tooth position, especially near the end of the root. Secondary cementum is slowly and continuously deposited throughout life and forms incremental lines. Incremental lines (devised by Boyde) appear as cross-striations on the enamel of teeth due to cementum apposition, and are thought to represent daily increments of growth. They can be seen on histological section. The age can be calculated by counting the number of lines from the neonatal line onwards. This is mainly applicable to infants. This is mainly applicable to infants. Root ResorptionQ It involves both cementum and dentin, which show characteristically sharp grooves. Absorption of the root stas first at the apex and extends upwards. It usually occurs in the late age. It may be due to pathological process. Transparency of the RootQ It is not seen until about 30 years of age. The canals in the dentin are at first wide. With age they are filled by mineral, so that they become invisible and the dentin becomes transparent. It is the most reliable of all criteriaQ."

Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin. Samples to be preserved for chemical analysis * Blood * Routine viscera * Lung * Brain * Hea * Spleen is considered as best specimen due to presence of more RBCs.

Apart from toxicology, gastric lavage (or nasogastric lavage) is sometimes used to confirm levels of bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract.Gastric lavage is used infrequently in modem poisonings and some authorities have suggested that it notbe used routinely, if ever, in poisoning situations. Lavage should only be considered if the amount of poison ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.Lavage is contraindicated when patients have a compromised, unprotected airway and in patients at risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage or perforation. Relative contraindications include when the poisoning is due to a corrosive substance , hydrocarbons, or for poisons that have an effective antidote."

The rate of putrefaction is slower in water than in air. Putrefaction is more rapid in warm, fresh water than in cold, salt water. It is more rapid in stagnant water than in running water. Putrefaction is delayed when a body is lying in deep water and is well protected by clothing, while it is rapid in a body lying in water contaminated with sewage. As the submerged cadavers float face down with the head lower than the trunk, gaseous distension and postmoem discolouration are first seen on the face and then spread to the neck, upper extremities, chest, abdomen and the lower extremities in that order. Fluid gravitation in the head ours marked decomposition. When the body is removed from the water, putrefaction is hastened as the tissues have absorbed much water.

AN INQUEST IS AN ENQUIRY INTO THE CAUSE OF DEATH. or AN INQUEST IS A LEGAL INQUIRY INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE CAUSE OF DEATH OF A DECEASED PERSON IN CASES OF SUDDEN, SUSPICIOUS AND UNNATURAL DEATHS. POLICE INQUEST. Conducted by an officer in charge of a police station. Its usually conducted by an officer of the rank of sub inspector of police. The police officer making the inquest is known as investigating officer(I.0.). Police inquest is conducted under S.174 of Cr PC if the police officer in charge receives information that a person has committed suicide, or has been killed by another or by an animal or by machinery or by an accident, or has died under circumstances raising a reasonable suspicion that some other person has committed an offence. Before the inquest is done by police it should be informed to the executive magistrate of the area. The inquest repo prepared by the police is known as Panchnama. In case of any doubt regarding the cause of death or in case of any unnatural the body of deceased is sent by investigating officer for autopsy to the concerned medical officer with the inquest repo. Magistrate inquest is conducted in case of o Death in prison o Death in police custody and while under police interrogation o Death due to police firing o Death in a psychiatric hospital o Dowry deaths o Exhumation (S.174(4) and 176, S.CrP.C) coroners inquest According to Coroner&;s Act 1871 coroner&;s inquest existed in Mumbai. Coroner used to be a special officer appointed by the government to inquire into causes of unnatural deaths. The Coroner was required to have a legal qualification and is usually an advocate. attorney, pleader, or first class magistrate. or a transferred metropolitan magistrate (all of whom must have a minimum of five years experience in the legal field). He held the rank of a First Class Judicial Magistrate. The coroners cou was a cou of inquiry and not a trial cou.

However, phenol is 8 times more toxic than Lysol * Dettol is chlorinated phenol with turpineol * Household phenol (sold as phenyle) contains five percent phenol in water. * Derivatives of phenol 1. Cresol 2. Thymol 3. Creosate (coal tar) 4. Menthol 5. Tannic acid 6. Napthol 7. Resorcinol. Uses 1. Antiseptic and disinfectant 2. Manufacture of plastic Absorption, Metabolism and Excretion * Phenol is absorbed from skin, gastric mucosa, per rectum, per vagina and respiratory tract * Phenol is conveed into hydroquinone and pyrocatechol and excreted in urine. Traces are excreted by lungs, salivary glands, and skin. Fatal dose: * 2 gm crystals * 25 to 50 ml of household phenol Fatal period: 3 to 4 hours. Mechanism of Action * Phenol has local as well as systemic action * Locally it acts as corrosive agent and when absorbed, it causes CNS depression, metabolic acidosis and renal failure. * Carbolic acid has great penetrating power and it coagulates protein. * Phenols have a powerful antipyretic effect similar to that of salicylates. * Phenols and derivatives of phenols cause methemoglobinemia Clinical Features Local: When applied to skin or mucosa, it causes burning pain, numbness, tingling and anesthesia. It causes corrosion and produce white eschar (scar), which falls off in few days leaving brown stained area. Systemic: 1. GIT: Burning pain followed by tingling numbness and anesthesia. Nausea and vomiting. 2. RS: Respiration is slow and labored. 3. CNS: Headache, giddiness, unconsciousness, convulsions, coma. 4. Oliguria and hepatic failure. 5. Urine: May be colorless but on exposure to air turns green due to oxidation of phenol metabolites (hydroquinone and pyrocatechol). It is known as carboluria. 6. The hydroquinone and pyrocatechol may cause pigmentation in the cornea and various cailages, a condition known as oochronosis. Management * Skin: Wash with undiluted polyethylene glycol. * Oxygen/ventilatory suppo * Intravenous fluids and vasopressors to suppo blood pressure * Ingestion: Cautious stomach wash with sodium or magnesium sulfate solution * Lidocaine for ventricular arrhythmias * Benzodiazepines for seizures * Treat methemoglobinemia - if methemoglobinemia is > 30%, ingest Methylene blue (1-2 mg/kg).

All the muscles of body begin to relax soon after death. It is due to stoppage of aerobic processes. Muscles remain relaxed as long as the ATP content is sufficient high to permit the splitting of actin-myosin cross bridge.* Once ATP content is completely depleted, stiffening of muscles occur, i.e. Rigor mortis.* Following rigor mortis, muscles become flaccid again due to action of alkaline liquid produced by putrefaction, i.e. secondary relaxation."

Glancing kick by a foot Avulsion (Shearing laceration):Here also there is overstretching of skin like in stretch laceration but the force involved is much more severe and the area involved is comparatively larger. There is separation of the skin from the underlying tissues over a relatively large area that is also called FLAYING. This is characteristic of run over accidents. The below image shows Flaying:"

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Galton method Galton method or Finger prints or dactylography is the best system of identification till date. The fingerprints are capable of endless variation so that there is one chance in sixty four billions of two persons having identical prints. Dactylography / Dermatoglvphics / Galton system / Finger prints Finger prints are present from bih both on epidermis and dermis, remain constant through out life and can't be altered without destroying true skin. Finger print pattern is absolutely individual i.e. no two hands are entirely alike, not even identical twins. That's why, it is best (most sensitive and most specific) and most reliable method of identification (Quetelet's rule of biological variation). DNA finger printing may be same in monozygotic twins. The pattern is neither inherited nor identical in any two persons. So the paternity cannot be proved through finger print patterns. However, paternity can be proved by DNA finger printing. Loops (67% most common) > whorls (25%) > arches (7%) > composite (2% least common) are four main types of pattern. It is accepted that chances of 2 finger prints matching 16 ridge characteristic are infinitely small (Parikh's). Inpractice 8 - 16 (Reddy) / 16 - 20 (Seth, Simpson) points of fine comparision are accepted as proof of identity. Locard's poroscopy method is study of microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweatgland present on ridges of fingers. These pores are permanent, remain un changed during life and are very usefulwhen only fragments of fingerprints are available. Each milimeter contains 9 - 18 pores. Criminals may attempt to multilate finger prints by applying CO2 snow, corrosive agents, burns or eroding against hard surface. But these manners do not destroy finger prints permanently unless true skin is completely destroyed."

Both can occur in strychnine poisoning :-\n\n\nIf death occurs with violent contractions (during convulsions) for some time prior to death, it causes complete exhaustion â Rapid onset and short duration of rigor mortis.\nIf death is almost instantaneous, with a very short convulsive phase, there is no exhaustion â3 Rapid onset and longer duration of rigor mortis.\n\n\nIn both conditions, onset is early (rapid).

These includea) Sadism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on ones partner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc.b) Lust murder: In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.c) Necrophagia: (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat): This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure.d) Masochism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, tortured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual partner.e) Necrophilia: In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants.f) Fetishism: A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm, eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc.g) Transvestism = Eonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interest, and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality.h) Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these parts with several fingers or whole hands (it is an offence when done in public).i) Exhibitionism (Sec 294IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine).j) Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom: Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman.k) Frotteurism: Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone.l) Undinism: In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex.m) Indecent assault (Sec 354 IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual part of either or is sexually favored. In such assaults, a man may try to kiss a woman, press or fondle with her breasts, touch or expose the genitalia or thighs, try to put a finger in her vagina, play with vulva.# A medical practitioner can be accused of indecent assault if he examines a female patient by stripping her clothes without her consent or even with her consent in the absence of a female attendant.# Such assaults are punishable under Sec 354 IPC, upto 2 years imprisonment and/or fine.n) Uranism: General term for perversion of the sexual instinct.o) Satyriasis: Incessant sexual desire.p) Priapism: Painful penile erection in absence of sexual desire."

Patients have hypovolemia from these osmotic movements of fluid, and hemolysis is not a significant feature. As it enters the lungs, fresh water destroys surfactant activity, leading to alveolar collapse and intrapulmonary shunting (perfusion without ventilation). Water is reabsorbed into the vascular system, producing volume overload with subsequent hyponatremia and hemolysis of red blood cells.

    "explanation": "Ans. is `d' i.e., Frame method Age from teeth after 20 years Teeth eruption is useful for age estimation upto about 18 years, beyond which it is just a guess work. The methods used are :? A. Gustafson's method : Useful only in persons older than 21 years of age, depending on the physiological changes in each of the dental tissues. 1. Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel). 2. Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent pa of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis). 3. Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, sta from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis. 4. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde). 5. Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root sta at apex and extend upward (may be pathological). 6. Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria). B. Mile's method : Age can be known by changes of root transparency. C. Boyde' method : On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at bih (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination. D. Stack's method : Age of infant can be known from height and weight of erupting teeth."

When it is slow, the gross appearance of the skin resembles myxedema because of the edematous condition of the face and limbs. Particularly striking are bright red erythematous areas rather than the dark postmortem lividity blotches usually noted. Bullae may occur over areas of chronic pressure or contact. When death follows rapid cooling, the lack of cyanosis in the skin in hypostatic areas is the significant external sign.INTERNALLY: Even with rapid cooling, and minimal external signs, internal examination demonstrated conclusive features. In order of frequency, gastrointestinal lesions are noted in about 90% of cases and about 80% in the pancreas. In the gastrointestinal tract, order of frequency of involvement is the stomach, the duodenum, and occasionally the esophagus. Seen early, the lesions consist of many small submucosal hemorrhages (black in color). Later, lesions present as small shallow ulcers. Gross pancreatic changes vary from focal fat necrosis to severe hemorrhage of the pancreas and nearby tissue. Microscopically, there were micro-infarcts in all organs except the liver due to hemoconcentrated packed RBCs in capillaries. Fat is noted in liver, adrenals, and kidney. Some cases show myocardial changes."

Putrefaction Review: Putrefaction is disintegration of body tissues after death produced by the action of bacteria and other microorganism thriving on the body. It represents the last stage in resolution of body from the inorganic to organic state. Putrefaction is the most absolute sign of death. Rate of Putrefaction significantly depends on the medium in which the body lies (Caper&;s Dictum) Caper&;s Dictum: Effect of medium (in which body lies) on rate of putrefaction Casper&;s dictum relates to the rate of putrefaction of a dead body and helps in estimation of time since death. Caper&;s dictum states that a body decomposes in air twice as rapidly as in water and eight times as rapidly in eah. Temperature being the same the ratio of rate of putrefaction of a dead body in water, air and buried in ground is 1:2:8 Putrefaction can be identified by both external and internal signs that often in a predictable sequence. First sign of Putrefaction (External) First Internal sign of Putrefaction Greenish discolouration of flank over cecum (right iliac fossa) is the first clinical sign of Putrefaction The greenish discolouration is due to formation of sulphamethemoglobin Typically Appears in 12-24 hours The first internal sign of putrefaction is Greenish discolouration on undersurface of liver (often the area of the liver in contact with the caecum) Putrefaction of internal organs typically proceeds in a predictable fashion depending on multiple factors such as Firmness, Moisture content, density, and/or Quantity of blood in organs. As a general rule, the organs show putrefactive changes in the following order(Order according to Reddy) Larynx & trachea Infant brain Stomach, Intestine, Spleen Liver, Lung Brain Hea Kidney, Bladder Prostate, Uterus (non-gravid) Skin, muscle, tendon Bone Organs to Putrefy early Mucosa of trachea and larynx Stomach and intestine Spleen Liver Brain Organs that Putrefy Late Esophagus, Diaphragnm, Hea Lungs Kidney Urinary bladder Uterus (Non-Gravid) Prostate Ref: APC Essentials of Forensic Medicine by Anil Aggarwal"

So the force constricting the neck is external force (not the weight of the body as occurs in hanging).o Depending upon the method used to constrict the neck, strangulation can be divided into :Ligature strangulation : Neck is compressed by a ligature of which usually multiple rounds are given and no knot is tied.Throttling (manual strangulation): Neck is compressed by one or both hands. When neck is compressed by two palms, it is known as palmar strangulation.Bansdola : Compression of neck with one or two wooden sticks or bamboo.Garrotting: It is compression of neck by a rope thrown from behind. Spanish windlass is a type of garrotting, which used to be the official mode of execution in spain. In this, an iron collor around the neck was tightened by a screw for strangulation.Mugging (choke hold) : It is compression of neck by forearm or in the bend of elbow.Strangulation by knee/foot: In this, neck is compressed by knee or foot."

The most common cause of such rigor mortis is antenatal haemorrhage.MacerationIf the dead fetus remains for some time in the uterus surrounded by liquor amnii but without air, an aseptic autolysis of the foetus occurs. This is known as macerationMummificationIt occurs when death of a foetus results from a deficient supply of blood or when liquor amnii is scanty and when no air has entered the uterus.

Phosphorus poisoning Phosphorus is a protoplasmic poison affecting cellular oxidation and causing anoxic necorbiosis, classically affecting liver. It increases fat deposition and inhibits glycogen deposition in liver. It is used in fire works (Diwali poisoning) and as rat poison. Lethal dose is 60-120 mg. Phosphorus occurs in two forms :? 1) White/yellow phosphorus : It is white, and becomes yellow on exposure to air. It is translucent, waxy, luminous and crystalline cylinders. It has garlic like odor. It is insoluble in water and luminous in dark. Its fumes show phosphorescence. 2) Red phosphorus : It is reddish brown, ine, odourless and tasteless. It is nontoxic (thus poisoning occurs only due to white phosphorus). It is put on the sides (striking surface) of match box (along with powdered galss). Acute poisoning It has following stages : i) 1st Stage (GI irritation) : There is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and garlic odor. This stage lasts for 8 hours to 3 days. ii) 2nd Stage (Asymptomatic) : This stage lasts for 3 days. iii) 3rd Stage : There is liver and kidney damage due to absorbed phosphorus. Initially liver is enlarged due to acute fatty infiltration. Later liver shruks due to necrosis, i.e. acute yellow atrophy. Chronic poisoning Toothache is the first symptom which is associated with loosening of teeth, necrosis of gums and osteomyelitis of jaw. Therefore chronic phosphorus poisoning is also know as phossy jaw (or glass jaw). Postmoem appearance There is garlic odor. Viscera and stool glow in dark (due to luminosity). To preserve luminosity, viscera are preserved in saturated saline solution. Rectified spirit is not used as it causes loss of luminosity."

    "explanation": "Ans. b (High voltage electrical bums). (Ref. Parkih's textbook of FMT, 6th ed., pg 4.173)External features of electrocution (high voltage electrical burns)# Evidence of fatal electrocution can vary widely at autopsy, including the possibility of no skin marks being found at all.# At the point of entry, firm contact with the electrical conductor results in the current passing through the skin, heating up the tissue fluids, producing steam and possibly splitting the epidermis or the epidermal-dermal junction. The result is the production of a raised blister, which collapses on cooling after the current is stopped- the so-called 'electrical mark'.# The entry mark in this case would appear as a raised grey or white ring with an umbilicated centre. If the initial contact is less firm, a spark may jump from the conductor to the skin, producing very high local temperatures, which melt a small area of keratin on the skin.# In these incidences, the entry lesion appears after cooling as a raised, hard brown nodule, and is termed a 'spark lesion'.# Surrounding the electric mark is also commonly found an 'areola' of blanched skin due to arteriolar spasm caused by the effects of the current on vessel walls.# In high-voltage bums, sparks may jump a significantly greater distance (several cms) giving multiple spark lesions and producing a 'crocodile skin' effect. Sometimes, minimal marks are found: there may be small white and flattened blisters, usually found on the palms of the hand, which are easily missed at autopsy.# If the current is allowed to continue passing through the body for a considerable length of time, extensive charring and damage to the skin and underlying tissues may be present at autopsy, resulting in 'electrical burns'.# Sometimes, extensive 'flash burns' may be evident on the victim as any other thermal burn, but these are often produced by current passing by the body as opposed to through the body.Internal appearances# Significant findings in the internal organs of electrocution fatalities are rare or often non-specific because the conductive electrolytes present in the internal tissues means that any current passing through them is usually diffused so that little thermal damage is produced. Non-specific findings have included epicardial petechiae in death by cardiac arrest, and pleural and intracerebral petechiae with congestion and cyanosis of the face and lungs in respiratory arrest."

The increase in weight is not constant & is not a reliable indication of breathing.Foidere's Test or Static test Q: The lung are ligated across their hi la & separated. The average weight of both lungs before respiration are 30-40 gram & after respiration 60 to 66 gram. The increase in weight is due to increased flow of blood.Hydrostatic (or Raygafs) testQ: It is based on fact that on breathing, the volume of lung is increased, which more than compensates the weight of the additional blood, due to which their specific gravity is dimtnshed. The specific gravity of lung before respiration varies from 1040 to 1050 & after respiration about 940.This test is not necessary when-the foetus is monster, the foetus is macerated or mummified, the foetus is born before 180 days of gestation, the stomach contain milk & umblical cord has separated & a scar has formed.Wredin's testQ Change in Middle ear): With respiration air replaces the gelatinous substances, which found before birth, in few hours to five weeks.Breslau's second life test or stomach bowel test : If respiration takes place, stomach & intestine floats in water otherwise they sink. This is known as Breslau's second life test.Vagims Lfterinus : Child may breathe while it is in womb, after the rupture of the membrane.Vagitus vaginalis : Child may breathe while its head is in vagina. Therefore, proof of breathing is not the proof of live birth.Florence test Q: It is test for seminal fluid'1. The test is not the proof of seminal fluid, but only of presence of some vegetable or animal substances. A negative reaction proves that the stain is not seminal."

Modification of putrefaction in excess of moisture such as bodies as bodies immersed in water (or damp graves and wet vaults) - Adipocere Formationn (Saponification): Transformation of fatty tissue into yellowish white greasy wax like substance (Grave Wax). Typically occurs from hydrolysis of fat with the release of fatty acids which being acidic inhibit putrefactive bacteria. - Emits a Sweetish Rancid odour when adiopocere is established (Late stages): A penetrating Ammonica odour is typical in the early stages. Modification of Putrefaction in a dry environment with no or minimal moisture (hot and dry environment like desses or inside a chimney. - Mummification: Results from drying or dehydration of tissues (instead of liquefying putrefaction). The body shrivels and is conveed into a hard, leathery or parchment like mass of skin and tendons surrounding the bone. Forensic Impoance of mummification, lies in preservation of tissue. - Emits no Foul smell (Odourless) Ref: Knight&;s Forensic Pathology 4th edition Pgno: 610"

Undiluted semen has an acid phosphatase activity of 340 to 360 Bodanskyunits or 2500 to 3500 Angstrom units per ml. The concentration of acid phosphatase gradually falls with time in vaginal secretions, and positive reactions are found for periods of thiysix hours, with gradual disappearance in 72 hrs. Five to ten ml of normal saline solution is placed in the vagina with a syringe. The fluid is then removed and placed in a sealed tube and refrigerated for enzyme examination. Concentration in excess of hundred Bodansky units with or without motile sperms indicate that ejaculation occurred within twelve hours of examination. Dried seminal stains which have not undergone putrefaction retain acid phosphatase activity for weeks or months, although enzymatic activity decreases slowly with time. This test is conclusive in the absence of demonstrable sperms or in aspermia. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-434,435"

Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin. Samples to be preserved for chemical analysis * Blood * Routine viscera * Lung * Brain * Hea * Spleen is considered as best specimen due to presence of more RBCs.

In fresh water drowning due to hemodilution the chloride content is decreased and in salt water drowning due to hemoconcentration the chloride content is increased in left side of hea. A 25% difference in chloride is significant but the test is of doubtful value. Limitations of gettler test:? 1. No value in atypical drowning; congenital cardiac defects as shunts and patent foramen ovale; and if drowning medium contains same amount of chloride. 2. There is progressive loss of Cl- from blood after death. Therefore the test has to be made within a reasonably sho time after death"

Informed written consent should be obtained if the age of victim is above 12 years. If she is less than 12 years of age or if she is mentally unsound, the written consent of parent/guardian should be taken (Sec. 90 IPC). Victim (female) should be examined by or under supervision of a female RMP (Sec. 53(2) CrPC). Finding which are suggestive of rape are :- Signs of struggle on clothes (tear, blood, semen, mud etc), body and genitals (abrasion, contusion, bites or nail marks etc). Presence of the semen in the vagina (proof of sexual intercourse). Presence of spermatozoa in the vagina. Locards principal of exchange states that whenever two bodies come in contact with each other, there is exchange of material between the two and so a criminal can be linked to crime. In case of rape, piece of cloth, button, hair, blood, saliva, semen or smegma from the accused may be found on the body of victim and conversly materials of victim may be found on the body of accused. Presence of smegma bacilli in vagina is suggestive of coitus. B.Examination of accused An accused can be examined even without his consent (Sec 53(A) CrPC). Findings may be Presence of torn frenulum is consistent with a recent intercourse. The presence of smegma under prepuce is inconsistent with recent intercoures as it gets rubbed off during sexual intercourse and may be deposited in vagina. It takes about 24 hours to accumulate. Thus, absence of smegma may indicate sexual intercourse, provided no bath is taken. Presence of vaginal epithelial cells on penis can be detected by lugol's iodine."

    "explanation": "Ans. D: Absorption elution test The Takayama Test is based on the reaction of pyridine with hemoglobin to form hemochromogen crystals. Takayama is a crystal test used for the confirmation of the presence of blood on samples. Benzidine test used to confirm the presence of blood - has been discontinued because the reagent is carcinogenic. It has largely been replaced by the Kastle-Meyer test, using a solution of phenolphthalein which turns pink in contact with even small traces of blood. The test works by detecting the presence of the enzyme peroxides in the blood. However, as this substance is also present in other biological materials, the Kastle-Meyer test is regarded as a screening procedure. It is highly sensitive, and positive reaction is judged presumptive of blood, and fuher confirmatory tests are carried out. Once a stain has been confirmed as blood it has to be determined whether it is human or animal. The precipitin test is used for this purpose. The precipitin test is sensitive, and will work on small traces of blood. The test is also known as the Uhlenbuth test. Spectrophotometric analysis of bloodstains allows them to be aged within the range of one day to three weeks. The Luminol test - The Luminol reacts with the iron complex in the blood's hemoglobin to produce a self-luminescence. The bloodstains literally glow in the dark with a faint bluish light. The most widely used method for finding invisible blood Blood group are determined in blood stains by: Latte's crust method Absorption-elution method Absorption-inhibition method Latex method Enzymological methods"

Normal value of chloride is 600mg% in both chambers. In sea water drowning, thre is said to be 30-40% increacse of chloride level in blood in left ventricle, while in fresh water drownin, the chloride get reduced by 505. this change is of course not evident by dry drowning. Ploucquet&;s Test:The blood flow in the lung beds is so increased after breathing that their weight is almost doubled, from 1/70 of the body weight before respiration to 1/35 after respiration. The increase in weight is not constant and is not a reliable indication of breathing. Fodere&;s test: The lung are ligated across their hila and separated. THe average weight of the both lungs before respiration varies from 30g to 40g, and after respiration from 60g to 66g. The increase in weight is due to the increased flow of blood. Raygat's test/hydrostatic test:The hydrostatic test is based on the principle that if the infant has breathed, the lung will float in water. each lung is cut into pieces and tested for floataion in water. A piece of liver is used as control. if the liver bit floats, the test has no meaning, it is clear that putrefaction has set in. If all the pieces of lung float, they are crushed under a weight and tested again. flaotion is positive when the baby has respired. But if the piece sink after pressure, no respiration has taken place. if some piece float while otherb sink, it mean feeble respiration taken place."

Root transparency (Ref: Reddy 33/e p70, 28/e p63-64)Root transparency is the most important sign of age determination as per Gustafson's method.Gustafson's MethodThe age estimation of adult over 21 years depends on the physiologic age changes in each of the dental tissues.AttritionQDue to wear and tear from mastication, occlusal (upper) surface of the teeth is destroyed gradually; first involving the enamel, then dentin, and at last, pulp is exposed in the old age.It depends on the functional use of the teeth and also up on the hardness of the enamel.ParadentosisQRegression of the gums and periodontal tissues surrounding the teeth takes place in the advancing age, gradually exposing the necks and adjacent parts of the roots, due to which the teeth become loose and fall off.Poor oral hygiene increases paradentosis.Secondary DentinQIt may develop from the walls w ithin the pulp cavity, and decrease the size of the cavity.First it is deposited at the pulp chamber and gradually extends downwards to the apex, and may completely fill the pulp cavity.This is partly due to ageing and partly due to pathological conditions like caries and paradentosis.Cementum AppositionQThe cementum increases in thickness particularly due to changes in the tooth position, especially near the end of the root.Secondary cementum is slowly and continuously deposited throughout life and forms incremental lines.Incremental lines (devised by Boyde) appear as cross-striations on the enamel of teeth due to cementum apposition, and are thought to represent daily increments of growth.They can be seen on histological section.The age can be calculated by counting the number of lines from the neonatal line onwards.This is mainly applicable to infants.Root ResorptionQIt involves both cementum and dentin, which show characteristically sharp grooves.Absorption of the root starts first at the apex and extends upwards.It usually occurs in the late age.It may be due to pathological process.Transparency of the RootQIt is not seen until about 30 years of age.The canals in the dentin are at first wide.With age they are filled by mineral, so that they become invisible and the dentin becomes transparent.It is the most reliable of all criteriaQ."

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Drowning in a fast flowing river o Postmortem lividity does not develop in drowning in running water (due to constantly changing position of body) and areas of contact flattening (due to collapsed capillaries)o Postmortem staining has so many synomyms, i.e. livor mortis/post mortem lividity/hypostasis/cadaveric lividity/ vibices/suggilation/darkening of death.o It refers to discoloration of skin and internal organs after death due to accumulation of fluid blood in toneless capillaries and small veins of dependent part of the body.o As dead body behaves like an inert substance, therefore there is gravitational flow of blood to the dependent parts of body, causing stagnation of blood in toneless capillaries and small veins, causing bluish purple staining of these parts.o Characteristic features of postmortem staining are:1. It does not appear elevated above the surface but has sharply defined (usually horizontal) margins.2. It is an early sign of death. It starts at about 1 hour, becomes a series of mottled patches within 1-3 hours and these pathces increase in size to coalesce in about 3-6 hours. After 6-12 hours, lividity is fully developed and fixed (unchangeable), i.e. primary lividity. It ends when purification sets in. Fixation of lividity is due to stagnation of blood in distended capillaries and venules (not due to coagulation of blood).3. If the position of body is changed, after development of lividity but before it becomes fixed, these patches will disappear and fresh ones will develop in the new dependent areas (secondary lividity), but lividity to a slight degree will remain in the original area due to staining of tissue by hemolysis (complete).4. Normally the staining is at first bluish-pink and afterwards bluish purple. In severe anemia, and death from haemorrhage, the staining is very faint. In deaths from asphyxia, where blood is deoxygenated and may not readily coagulate, the staining is intensely developed and purple in colour. In conditions where blood coagulates quickly eg. in lobar pneumonia lividity is less abvious.5. It is seen on dependent parts of the body, therefore site depends upon position of body after death:i) In supine: On posterior dependent portion of body. But not seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks and back of calves due to contact flattening, i.e. toneless capillaries are compressed and occluded by weight and pressure of body.ii) In hanging: Dependent lower half of both lower limb and upper limb (i.e. lower half of leg with feet and lower half of forearm with hands), and external genitalia.iii) In drowning: Head and upper half of body as head being the heaviest part becomes the dependent part. It does not develop in running water due to constantly changing position of the body.6. No lividity is seen on pressure points of body, i.e. contact pallor, as pressure caused by weight of body causes compression of toneless vessels and prevent their filling with blood:i) In supine: No lividity is seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks, occipital area and calf - contact flattening.ii) Also no lividity occurs in parts tightly tied with belt, waist band or brassiere and the area is seen as stripes or bands called vibices."

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Sulph - meth hemoglobin Signs of putrefaction The signs and effects of putrefaction are as follows :? 1. Colour changes The earliest sign of decomposition is greenish discoloration of body, seen in right iliac fossa externally and under liver internally. This is due to involvement of caecum. Which contains more liquid and is full of bacteria. In these areas, it appears in 12-18 hours and slowly spreads to whole body in 24-48 hours. Greenish discoloration is due to formation of sulph-meth-haemoglobin. Morbling occurs when Hb dissociates from RBCs and the colour of Hb is taken up by vessels, which are seen as prominent lines having purple or green or brown colour. Marbling occurs in 24-48 hours. 2. Formation of foul smelling gases Due to action of bacteria, foul smelling gases are formed, e.g. SO, , H2S, ammonia, methane and CO2. 3. Effects of gases Bloating up of body occurs in 34-48 hours. At the same time following changes occurs : i) Appearance of stomach contents and froth on nose and mouth. ii) Degloving and destocking with appearance of putrefactive blisters. iii) Emptying of hea due to pressure of gas. In 48-72 hours prolapse of rectum and uterus occur and postmoem delivery may occur if the dead woman is pregnant. Color of postmoem staining also changes to brown and finally to black. False rigidity (putrefactive rigidity) may occur at this time. 4. Appearance of maggots Flies lay their eggs in wounds, exposed natural orifices and exposed moist pas of the body and folds of skin, e.g. neck, axilla, nostrils, mouth etc. Flies lay eggs in 6-12 hours after death and these eggs change in larva (maggot) in 1-2 days. Thus maggots appear in 2-3 days after the death. After fuher 4-5 days, the maggots change into pupa, which conve into adult flies in next 3-5 days. Thus adult flies will be coming out of the body after total 8-12 days of death. Thus appearance of maggot determine the time since death. 5. Other late changes In 3-5 days : Nails and teeth become loose and can be pulled out, sutures of skull may separate. In 7-12 days : Liquefaction of body (colliquative putrefaction) occurs. In 1-3 months : Skeletonization of dead body occurs. Finally : Bones also decompose : Exposed bones in 1-5 years and deep burried bone (> 2 meters) in 25-100 years. 6. Internal changes Liver becomes spongy and is called as foamy or swiss cheese or honeycombed liver. In 7-12 days lequefaction of internal organs occur. 7. Floatation of body (if body is in water) Floatation of body occurs due to occumulation of sufficient putrefactive gases. Abdomen is above (due to gases) and spine is below during floatation. Time required for floatation is ordinarily 24 hours after death in summers and 2-3 days in winter. Factors affecting floatation are :- i) Causing early.floatation : Newborn mature infant, females, in summer, clothed body, obese, in sea water and in still pond water. ii) Causing delayed floatation : Still bih/immature newborn, male, in winter, naked body, thin built, in fresh water and in running stream water. Inspiration and expiration before death has no effect on floatation as floatation is due to putrefactive gases (not due to respiratory air)."

      "Age"

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Factors Affecting Algor Mois : i. Environmental temperature (major factor): Rate of fall of body temperature is directly propoional to the difference between the temperature of the dead body and the environmental temperature. ii. Air movement: Air movement over the surface of the dead body causes a quick fall of temperature due to increased evaporation of body fluids. iii. Humidity: Cooling is more rapid in a humid rather than in a dry atmosphere, since moist air is better conductor of heat. iv. Media of disposal: Cooling is earliest in water, and late in buried bodies. The ratio of the rates of fall of temperature in the three media, water:air: soil = 4:2:1. The rate is thus maximum in water, moderate in air and minimum in a buried body. v. Built of cadaver: Obese bodies cool slowly, and lean bodies rapidly, since fat is a bad conductor of heat. vi. Age and sex: Rate of loss of heat is more in children and the elderly, compared to adults because the surface area of the body is more in relation to the body volume. Females retain body heat for a comparatively longer period because of their subcutaneous fatty tissue. vii. Clothing or coverings of the body: A well-covered body retains heat for a longer period as compared to a naked or thinly clothed body, as clothes are bad conductors of heat."

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., IV Naloxone Treatment of morphine or heroin poisoningo Treatment can be divided into: -A. Treatment of toxicity (overdose)o Overdose is a medical emergency, and is treated with opioid antagonist to reverse the complications (respiratory depression) by antagonizing the action on opioid receptors. Intravenous naloxone is the antagonist of choince for morphine (heroin) poisoning. Oral naltrexone is used for maintenance therapy, once acute poisoning has been treated by iv naloxone. Intravenous nalmefene is another specific antagonist.B. Treatment of dependenceo Treatment of dependence include medically supervised withdrawal and detoxification, followed by maintenance therapy.(a) Detoxificationo Detoxification process include abrupt withdrawal of opioid followed by management of the emergent withdrawal symptoms, i.e., treatment of withdrawal syndrome. Detoxification can be done by any of the following:1. Substitution of long-acting opioid agonism:- Methadone is the treatment of choice. Because of its agonistic activity on opioid receptors it suppresses withdrawal symptoms. L-alpha-acetyl-methadol/ Levomethyl (LAAM) is the other opioid agonist which was used for this purpose. However it is no longer in use because some patients developed prolonged QT intervals (torsades de points).2. Substitution of partial agonist:- Buprenorphine can be used in place of methadone because of its partial agonistic activity on opioid receptor.3. Substitution by a2 agonists:- Clonidine acts as a sympatholytic agent due to its agonistic action on central presynaptic a2 receptors which reduce nor-adrenergic activity. Therefore, clonidine reduces the adrenergic withdrawal symptoms. Lofexidine another a2 agonist, is an alternative to clonidine.4. Clonidine plus naltrexone:- A more rapid detoxification can occur when clonidine is used along with naltrexone. Naltrexone, when given in opioid dependent patient, causes withdrawal symptoms because of its antagonistic action. These can be treated with clonidine. The addition of short acting Benzodiazepine (lorazepam or oxazepam) and NSAIDs, will help relieve withdrawl symptoms not covered by clonidine. It should he kept in mind that naltrexone should not be used alone for detoxification (to treat withdrawl syptoms) as it precipitates or worsens the withdrawl syndrome.5. Other drugs:- Dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylate(b) Maintenance therapyo Once detoxification phase is over (i.e., withdrawal symptoms have been managed), the patient is maintained on any of the following drugs to prevent relapse by reducing craving and preventing 'kick' or 'euphoria' produced by opioids (morphine or heroin). Drugs used are:-1. Methadone:- Reduces craving and 'kick/euphoria ' from morphine or heroin because their opioid receptors are already occupied.2. LAAM and buprenorphine:- Similarly reduce craving.3. Opioid antagonists (naltrexone):- Naltrexone can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of ex-opioid abusers who are fully withdrawn (otherwise it induces an acute withdrawl syndrome). Naltrexone prevents relapse by discouraging substance seeking behavior - If a patient, who is on naltrexone maintenance therapy, takes an opioid, there is no 'kick' or 'euphoria' as opioid receptors are already blocked. Naltrexone can be used with clonidine as in detoxification."

      "Cross examination",

    ],
    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Ans. C: Cross examination In stage of direct examination/ examination in chief, no leading questions are allowed except in those cases in which the judge is satisfied that a witness is hostile (hostile witness is one who purposely makes statement contrary to facts) Leading examination are allowed in cross-examination At re-examination, leading questions are not allowed Leading question/ suggestive interrogation It is a question that suggests the answer or contains the information the examiner is looking for. For example, this question is leading: You were at Jacky's bar on the night of July 15, weren't you? It suggests that the witness was at Jacky's bar on the night in question. The same question in a non-leading form would be: Where were you on the night of July 15? This form of question does not suggest to the witness the answer the examiner hopes to elicit. Leading questions may often be answerable with a yes or no (though not all uyes-no questions are leading). Depending on the circumstances leading questions can be objectionable or proper. The propriety of leading questions generally depends on the relationship of the witness to the pay conducting the examination. An examiner may generally ask leading questions of a hostile witness or on cross examination, but not on dire t examination. It is impoant to distinguish between leading questions and loaded questions: questions that are objectionable because they contain implicit assumptions. The classic example is: Have you stopped beating your wife? This type of question is not leading, as it does not suggest that the examiner expects any paicular answer. It is however objectionable because it assumes (among other things) that the witness (1) was married and (2) had in fact beaten his wife in the past, facts which (presumably) have not been established."

Due to cold, there is low metabolic activity and cold tissues fail to take up the delivered oxygen. Rarely skin is pale (white) and thus hypothermic deaths are also called as \"white deaths\". Skin may show erythematous patches or irregular red or violet patches on exposed pas of body. They are often present over extensor surfaces of large joints, such as the outer side of hips, the elbows and knees and at flank and face. Gastric mucosa may show small hemorrhages and ulceration (Wischnewski ulcers) Kidneys may show signs of acute tubular necrosis Urinary catecholamine levels are elevated in hypothermic deaths. The increased level of catecholamine indicate prolonged agonal stress. There is hyperglycemia with glucose in urine."

Abrasions, contusions, lacerations and fractures may be found. Bruises in abdominal wall and rupture of internal organs may be seen. Poking with stick, baton, rod, etc. is common. (2) Falanga (faiaka, bastinado): In this canes or rods are used to beat on the soles of the feet, or rarely to the palms of the hands or hips, which is very painful and debilitating. Contusions are found deep in the tissues. Faint red lines may be seen, and often hyperpigmentation along the lines of injury. Aseptic necrosis may occur. (3) Telefono: It consists of repeated slapping of the sides of the head (over ears) by the open palms of the assailant. This may cause rupture of ear drums and injury to the inner ear.

Local effects : Oxalic acid rarely damages the skin but readily corrode the mucus membrane of digestive tract. Systemic : (i) Shock : Large doses can cause death from shock; (ii) Hypocalcemia : Oxalic acid readily combines with calcium to cause hypocalcemia, which may present as tingling, numbness, twitching, tetany, and convulsions, (iii) Renal damage : It is due to oxaluria which may cause tubular necrosis. Antidote : Any calcium preparation (e.g. calcium gluconate/chloride, lime water, suspension of chalk) which conves poison into insoluble calcium oxalate is an antidote for oxalate poisoning."

    "explanation": "Ans. B. Cadaveric spasm. (Ref. Reddy's FMT 25th/p.85; Parikh's textbook of FMT 6th/pg. 3.18)# Cadaveric spasm is instantaneous rigorcharacterized by the sudden development of rigidity without the phase of primary relaxation.CADAVERIC SPASMCadaveric spasm (Instantaneous rigor, cataleptic rigidity) is characterized by the sudden development of rigidity without the phase of primary relaxation, usually localized to muscles that have forcefully contracted perimortem.RIGOR MORTISOrdinarily, death is followed immediately by total muscular relaxation - primary muscular flaccidity - succeeded in turn by generalised muscular stiffening - rigor mortis. After a variable period of time rigor mortis passes off spontaneously to be followed by secondary muscular flaccidity.ALGOR MORTIS (BODY COOLING)This is the most useful single indicator of the time of death during the first 24 hours post mortem. Some writers would regard it as the only worthwhile corporal method.The use of body temperature estimations to assess time of death applies only to cool and temperate climates since in tropical regions there may be a minimal fall in body temperature post mortem and in some extreme climates, (e.g. central Australia) the body temperature may even rise after death.LIVOR MORTIS (HYPOSTASIS. POST MORTEM LIMDITY/SUGGELLATIONS)Lividity is a dark purple discolouration of the skin resulting from the gravitational pooling of blood in the veins and capillary beds of the dependent parts of the body following cessation of the circulation. The process begins immediately after the circulation stops, and in a person dying slowly with circulatory failure, it may be pronounced very shortly after death. Within about 30-60 minutes of death the blood in most corpses, dead from natural or non-natural causes, becomes permanently incoagulable. This is due to the release of fibrinolysins, especially from small calibre vessels, e.g. capillaries, and from serous surfaces, e.g. the pleura."

    "explanation": "The hea is contracted and the chambers are empty when death has occurred from anaemia, but chambers contain blood when death occurs due to asthenia. After death, reduction of oxygen causes capillary dialtation which is followed by stasis of blood in the dilated capillaries and venules. This causes impaired venous return.As a result of which there is raised venous pressure resulting in over distension and rupture of capillaries and venules. This causes congestion and petechia haemorrhages.Haemorrhages are found in the substance of viscera. Postmoem, the blood is fluid and dark,because of increased amount of carbon dioxide. The large veins are full of blood. Hence the femoral vein is the best site of sample collection in autopsy, whereas the viscera are fully congested. Postmoem fluidity of the blood is assessed.

      "Phenobarbitone",
      "Phencyclidine",

    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Most drugs taken in overdose are extensively detoxified by the liver to produce inactive metabolites which are voided in the urine. Sometimes hepatic degradation produces active metabolites, but the secondary compounds are then conveed to non-toxic derivatives. Under these circumstances, forced diuresis is inappropriate. The procedure should be undeaken only if the following conditions are satisfied: # A substantial propoion of the drug is excreted unchanged. # The drug is distributed mainly in the extracellular fluid. # The drug is minimally protein-bound. # Principle-- Most drugs are weak electrolytes and exist paly as undissociated molecules at physiological pH. The extent of ionisation is a function of the ionisation constant of the drug (Ka for both acids and bases), and the pH of the medium in which it is dissolved. Ionisation constants are usually expressed in the form of their negative logarithm, pKa. Hence the pKa scale is analogous to the pH notation : the stronger an acid the lower its pKa, and the stronger a base the higher its pKa. Thus when pKa = pH, the concentrations of ionised and non-ionised drugs are equal. Cell membranes are most permeable to substances that are lipid soluble and in the non-ionised, rather than the ionised form. Thus the rate of diffusion from the renal tubular lumen back into the circulation is decreased when a drug is maximally ionised. Because ionisation of acidic drugs is increased in an alkaline environment, and that of basic drugs is increased in an acid solution, manipulation of the urinary pH enhances renal excretion. # Forced alkaline diuresis : This is most useful in the case of phenobarbitone, lithium, and salicylates. Administer 1500 ml of fluid IV, in the first hour as follows : - 500 ml of 5% dextrose - 500 ml of 1.2 or 1.4% sodium bicarbonate - 500 ml of 5% dextrose. # Forced acid diuresis : Forced acid diuresis is no longer recommended for any drug or poison, including amphetamines, strychnine, quinine or phencyclidine.

The points that are usually required to be determined regarding stains are: (1) nature of stain (whether the stains is blood or not); (2) the species (human or animal) from which the blood has come from; and (3) blood group.Nature of stain (whether the stain is blood or not)* To determine the nature of stain, following tests are used:1) Chemical tests# These tests are based on the peroxidase activity of haematin, which is, derived from oxidation of haem of haemoglobin or methemoglobin, present.# This enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide converts colourless salts into coloured bases.# Thus these tests are based on H2O2 and peroxidase enzyme. Tests are:i) Benzidine test: Greenish blue colour.ii) Phenolphthalein test (kastle myere test): Deep permanganate colour.iii) Leucomalachite green test: Bluish green or peacock blue colour.iv) Guaiacum test: Blue colour.v) Orthotoludine test (kohn test): Blue or green colour.vi) Amidopyrine test: Purple colour.2) Microchemical tests# These tests are based on property of haem part of hemoglobin to form characteristic coloured crystals.# The tests are:1) Teichmann's haemin crystal test.2) Takayama hemochromogen crystal test.3) Luminal spray test: It is especially useful in old obscure blood stains.3) Spetroscopy# It is most delicate and reliable test. It is based on the principle that hemoglobin and its derivatives give characteristic absorption bands when viewed through a spectroscope.4) Microscopy# Microscopic examination of RBCs is possible only in fresh stains.Detection of species (whether the blood has come from human or animal)* For detection of species, serological (immunological) tests are used. These tests are:1) Precipitin test2) Haemaglutination inhibition test (antiglobulin consumption test or absorption inhibition test).3) Gel diffusion test.4) Double diffusion test.5) Precipitation electrophoresis.6) Latex agglutination test.7) Isoenzyme method (enzymological test).Detection of blood group of blood stain* These tests are:1) Immunological (serological): (i) aborption-elution test, (ii) absorption-inhibition test, (iii) mixed agglutination test, (iv) latex test.2) Enzymological methods.3) Latte's crust method."

Heat stroke is associated with a core body temperature above 40degC and is subdivided into exeional and classic types. Neither type is associated with a hemorrhagic stroke. The exeional type is most commonly seen in people working or running outdoors in hot or humid climates. Characteristic findings include hot, dry skin, with or without sweating; profound lactic acidosis; rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria; the potential for acute tubular necrosis; and potential for disseminated intravascular coagulation. The classic type is most commonly seen in chronically ill patients, alcoholics, very young patients, the elderly, or morbidly obese people in hot or humid weather. It can be precipitated by drugs that inhibit sweating (e.g., anticholinergics, phenothiazine). Ref: Krishnan vij Textbook of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology; 5th ed; Page no: 160"

Ideally dying declaration should be recorded by executive or honorary magistrate, but can also be recorded by doctor, village head man, police or any other person, if there is no time to call a magistrate. Doctor has to ceify the patient to be compos mentis (sound mind). It is recorded in presence of two disinterested witnesses. Relatives and police officers are not allowed to be present. No oath is administered. It carries less weight than dying deposition as no cross-examination is possible. If the patient does not die after the recording of declaration, the dying declaration loses its impoance sice now he can be called to the cou and his evidence can be recorded after cross-examination."

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Waist - hip ratio > 0.85 in females Assessment of obesity Following parameters are used to assess obesity :? 1) Skin fold thickness (SFT) Since it is most accessible, SFT is the most common method used to assess obesity. Measurements are taken at 4 sites : mid triceps (best site), biceps, subscapular and suprailiac regions. The sum of measurements _ 50 mm in girls and 240 mm in boys indicate obesity. At single mid triceps level (best site to measure SFT), thickness 18 mm in boys and 32 mm in girls indicate obesity. The instrument used to estimate SFT is Harpenden skin callipers. 2) Waist circumference (WC) and Waist / Hip ratio (WHR) These are good predictors for metabolic complications and risk of cardiovascular disease. The cut-off for waist circumference is 102 cms in boys (for India 90 cms) and 88 cms in girls (for India . 80 cms). WHR > 1.0 in men and > 0.85 in women indicates obesity and abdominal fat accumulation. 3) Waist-Height ratio (WHtR) It is the best indicator of cardiovascular risk. It is independent of age and sex. Cut-off value is 0.5. 4) Indices based on weight and/or height These are :? i) Body mass index (Qetelet's index) It is used internationally as reference standard for assessing the prevalence of obesity. It is dependent both on height and weight (has been explained earlier). ii) Ponderal index It is dependent both on height and weight.

After death, dead body behaves like an inert substance and therefore, if atmospheric temperature is low, body loses its heat by conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation, so as to attain the atmospheric temperature, i.e. the body cools. No cooling of dead body occurs if atmospheric temperature is higher than that of body. Cooling of body starts 1/2 to 1 hour after death.oHeat stiffening is permanent.oOn warming the part of body, cold stiffening disappears.oGas (putrefactive) rigidity disappears on incision due to release of gases.Differential diagnosis of post mortem stiffening1. Rigor mortis#It is defined as contraction, stiffening, shortening and opacity of muscles after death. It is preceded by a period of relaxation. It occurs after molecular (cellular) death. In tropical countries (e.g. India), it begins 1-2 hours after death, takes further 2 hours to develop and lasts for 18-36 hours in summer and 24-48 hours in winter. In temperate countries, it begins in 3-6 hours, takes further 2-3 hours to develop and lasts for 2-3 days.2. Heat stiffening#In body exposed to extensive heat (>65degC) there results stiffening and flexion of all joints, known as 'Pugilistic or boxers or defence posture', due to denaturation and coagulation of proteins. However, heat stiffening is permanent (unlike rigor mortis which passes off after few hours.)3. Cold stiffening#Due to exposure to freezing temperature, body becomes stiff due to freezing (solidification) of fats and body fluids. On warming the part of body, cold stiffening disappears, differentiating it from rigor mortis.4. Putrefactive (gas) stiffening#During decomposition, body part becomes rigid because of collection of gases in subcutaneous tissues and the pressure exerted by these gases. It can be differentiated from rigor mortis as other signs of putrefaction are present and putrefactive rigidity disappears on incision due to release of gases.5. Cadaveric spasm (instantaneous rigor or cataleptic rigidity)#The muscles, which were in contraction or spasm at the time of death, continue to be in spasm even after death, without the stage of primary relaxation."

The ligature mark is situated above the level of thyroid cartilage between the larynx and the chin in 80 percent cases. In partial hanging, the feet touch the ground.# Le facie sympathique (if the ligature knot presses on cervical sympathetic, the eye on the same side may remain open and its pupils dilated) is seen in antemortem hanging. The eyes are frequently protruded and firmer and the conjunctiva congested, the pupils are usually dilated. Saliva may be found dribbling from the angle of the mouth (due to stimulation of the salivary glands by the ligature).# Seminal emission is common.# In rare cases (5 to 10%), the intima of the carotid arteries show transverse split.# Hyoid bone is fractured in 15 to 20% cases. Are seen in persons above 40 years; involves the great horn at junction of the inner two-thirds and outer one-third.MECHANICAL ASPHYXIAAsphyxial deaths1. Suffocation--Mechanical obstruction to airways other than by hanging, strangulation and throttling. MC cause is inhalation of irritant gas.2. Smothering--Closing the external respiratory orifice by hand or by other means.3. Gagging--Closing mouth and nose with cloth etc., and tying around head or stuffing it into mouth.HANGINGHanging is that form of asphyxia which is caused by suspension of the body by a ligature, which encircles the neck, the constricting force being the weight of the body.In partial hanging, the bodies are partially suspended; the weight of the head (5-6 kg) acts as the constricting force.Topical hanging: In typical hanging, the ligature runs from the midline above the thyroid cartilage symmetrically upward on both sides of neck to the occipital region.Causes of Death1. Asphyxia: A tension of 15 kg on ligature blocks the trachea.2. Venous congestion: The jugular vein is closed by a tension in the rope of 2 kg.3. Combined asphyxia and venous congestion: this is the commonest cause.4. Cerebral anemia: A tension of 4 to 5 kg on ligature blocks carotid arteries, and 20 kg blocks the vertebral arteries.5. Reflex vagal inhibition from pressure on the vagal sheath or carotid bodies.6. Fracture or dislocation of the cervical vertebrae.Fatal period: The usual period is 3 to 5 minutes.Judicial hangingThe cause of death in judicial hanging is fracture dislocation at the level of second and third or third and fourth cervical vertebra.Lynchingis a type of homicidal death by hanging by large group of people.Strangulationis that form of asphyxia which is caused from constriction of the neck by a ligature without suspending the body. It is of two types (1) Strangulation by ligature, and (2) manual strangulation or throttling.The common methods of homicidal strangulation are: (1) Strangulation by ligature, (2) Throttling, (3) Bansdola, (4) Garrotting, and (5) MuggingMugging is homicidal strangulation caused by holding the neck of the victim in the bend of the elbow.Bansdola is a type of homicidal strangulation caused with sticks.Garroting is type of homicidal strangulation caused by twisting a lever like tomiquet.ThrottlingThrottling is manual strangulation. Fracture of the hyoid bone in 30-50% cases. Fracture of the thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone are usually found in above 40 years. Hyoid bone fracture does not occur in choking. It is always homicidal.SuffocationSuffocation is a general term to indicate that form of asphyxia which is caused by deprivation of oxygen, either due to lack of oxygen in the environment or from obstruction of the air-passages.SmotheringSmothering is a form of asphyxia which is caused by closing the external respiratory orifices either by the hand or by any other means, or blocking up the cavities of the nose and mouth by the introduction of a foreign substance, such as mud, paper, cloth, etc.Gaggingis a form of asphyxia which results from forcing a cloth into the mouth, or the closure of mouth and nose by a cloth or similar material, which is tied around the neck.OverlayingIt is a type of smothering. Overlaying or compression suffocation results due to compression of the chest, so as to prevent breathing. Overlaying by mother is common in European countries. The usual findings are those of asphyxia.BurkingIt is a method of homicidal smothering and traumatic asphyxia.Homicidal chokingIn choking, there is obstruction within airways. It is very rare and is practicable only when the victim is an infant or suffering from disability or disease, or under the influence of alcohol.Cafe CoronaryThis is a condition in which a healthy but grossly intoxicated person, who begins a meal, suddenly turns blue, coughs violently, then collapses. Death appears to be due to sudden heart attack, rather than due to asphyxia. A blow on the back or on the sternum may cause coughing and expel the foreign body.Traumatic AsphyxiaTraumatic asphyxia results from respiratory arrest due to mechanical fixation of the chest, so that the normal movement of the chest wall is prevented. Common cause is crushing by falls of earth in a coal mine or during tunneling or in a building collapse. An intense cyanosis of deep purple or purple-red colour of the head, neck and upper chest, above the level of compression is the prominent feature.Sexual AsphyxiaPartial asphyxia causes cerebral disturbance with feeling of sexual gratification. These cases are associated with some form of abnormal sexual behavior, usually masochism and transvestism."

    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Imprint abrasion Real confusion in this question is between imprint abrasion and patterned bruising. In both imprint abrasion and patterned brusing there is mark or pattern of the object causing injury. Abrasion is caused by friction and/or pressure between the skin and some rough object or surface. For abrasions to occur some movement along with pressure is essential between the object or instrument or weapon and the skin. In abrasions superficial layers of skin are crushed and damaged. Bruises or contusions are caused by blunt trauma resulting in rupture of small blood vessels which lead to effusion of blood in subcutaneous or subepithelial tissues. However skin is intact in most cases until associated with abrasions. In an accident in which victim is overrun by vehicle, there will be movement and friction between the tyre and skin along with pressure by the tyre leading to imprint or patterned abrasion. There can be intradermal bruises also which are usually associated with patterned objects. So the tyre mark will be primarily an imprint or patterned abrasion (tyre has a pattern because of ridges and grooves) associated with bruises too. Also know? Abrasions are of following types Scratches - a linear injury produced by a sharp object, such as a pin, thorn, nail or tip of any sharp weapon. Graze - An injury which is produced when a broad surface of skin slides or scraps against a rough surface. These are the most common type. Commonly seen in road accidents. Violent lateral (tangential) rubbing against a rough surface can produce abrasion known as 'brush burn' or 'gravel rash'. 'Friction burn' can occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface. 3. Patterned abrasions: In it pattern of the object causing injury is produced over the skin when the force is applied at right angle to the surface of the skin. Patterned abrasions are produced either by pressure of the object or by impact with a rough object. The .former is called pressure (crushing or friction) abrasion and the latter is known as impact (contact or imprint) abrasion. There can be associated bruising in the surrounding area. Examples are ligature mark, nail and Muir& mark, teeth bite marks, whip marks, radiator, grill or tyre marks in vehicular accidents and muzzle marks in gunshot injuries."

Force of compression is the weight of body (endogenous force). No suspension. Compression on neck is by a ligature, hands, sticks, elbow, knee or foot. It is outside force applied (exogenous force). Local external P.M. findings Ligature mark is above the thyroid is oblique, symmetrical and incomplete. Knot usually present. Usually no mark at site of knot: * In fixed knot, mark is inverted 'V' shaped. * In running noose, mark is transverse. Mark usually single. Surface of mark abraded or contused. Surface may show pattern of ligature used. Surface hard. Mark-yellowish brown in colour. Margins of mark show petechial haemorrhages. Surrounding skin shows few petechial haemorrhages. Depth of mark is less. Mark is on or below the thyroid. Is horizontal, complete and continuous (in absence of ligature mark there are other injuries on neck depending upon type of strangulation). Usually absent. Mark is horizontal, complete and continuous. Usually multiple marks. Usually lacerated. Pattern not seen. Soft, due to frank bleeding. Black. Frank bleeding present. Multiple haemorrhages present. More, like a groove. Local internal P.M. findings Under the mark area is seen as dry, white, glistening pad of fat. Muscles may be lacerated. Usually no laceration of blood vessels and their walls, (lacerated injudicial hanging). May be fracture of trachea, thyroid and larynx. Cervical vertebrae fractured usually at C2-C3 and rarely C3-C4 or C1-C2, injudicial hanging. Fracture of hyoid bone in uncommon. 21. Injury to spinal cord, pons and medulla common injudicial hanging. Area is haemmorrhagic Lacerated. Lacerated. Usually fractured. Fracture cervical vertebrae uncommon. Fracture of hyoid bone, of adduction type (inward compression fracture), very common in throtting. 21. No injury to spinal cord, pons and medulla. Signs of struggle and violence 22. Signs of struggle and violence absent. 23. No question of sexual assault on female victim, as this is usually suicidal and it is uncommon in females. 24. Since hanging is usually suicidal no question of hiding the cause of death. 22. Due to struggle, abrasions and contusions present on the body. 23. May be sexual assault on female victim. 24. Since strangulation is usually homicidal there is attempt at hiding the crime. Dead body may be hanged; thrown in water, jungle, or acid; may be burnt. General external P.M. findings 25. Features of asphyxia mild. 26. Head tilted to side, opposite to knot. 27. Neck stretched. 28. Face usually pale. 29. Mild cyanosis on nose, lips, tongue, ears and nails 30.

A cover slip is placed over this and a drop of Florence solution (Potassium iodide, iodine and water) is allowed to run under the cover slip. If semen is present dark brown crystals of choline iodide appear immediately. They are rhombic or needle shaped crystals resembling haemin but are larger and arranged in clusters, rosettes, crosses etc. Choline originates from the seminal vesicles. Positive test is not a proof of seminal fluid, but only the presence of some vegetable or animal substance. A negative reaction is a proof that the stain is not seminal."

Before birth weight of lung is 1/70 of body weight and after respiration it becomes 1/35 of body weight due to increased blood flow in lung beds. Static test or Fodere's test: o The average weight of both lungs before respiration is 30-40 gm and after respiration is 60-70 cm. Hydrostatic test (Raygat's test, 1st life test): o The specific gravity of a non-respired lung is 1040-1050 and of a respired lung is 940-950, so, after respiration lung floats on water (specific gravity of water is 1000). o False positive hydrostatic test may occur (i.e.non-respired lung may float) in decomposition and in attempted artificial respiration. o False negative hydrostatic test (i.e. respired lung may sink down) may occur in atelectasis, pulmonary oedema, bronchopneumonia, and congenital syphylis. Breslau's second life test: o It assumes that a live born child would respire and therefore, would also swallow some air into the stomach and bowel. o Hence they float on water. This test is falsely positive in putrefaction (due to putrefied gases) or in cases of attempted artificial respiration. Werdin's test: o Before birth middle ear contains gelatinous embryonic tissue which is replaced by air after respiration."

Electric mark (Joule burn) is found at the point of entry of the current and diagnostic of contact with electricity. Exit marks are often seen as splits in the skin at points where the skin has been raised into ridges by the passage of current. Heat generated by the current may melt the calcium phosphate, which is seen radiologically as typical round density foci ('bone pearls' or 'wax drippings').

Legitimacy, 2. Inheritance of property, 3. Compensation case for slander against the mother.[?]LEGITIMACY & PATERNITYoLegitimacy: It is the legal state of a person born in lawful marriage.oAccording to section S.112, I.E.A, if at all a person is born during the continuance of a legal marriage, or within 280 days after the dissolution of the marriage by divorce or death of the husband, his birth is presumed to be legitimate.oIllegitimate or Bastard Child: if it can be proved that the husband could not possibly be the father of child by producing evidence that the alleged father.oQuestion of legitimacy arises in the following conditions:1. Inheritance: Remember! A legitimate child only can inherit the property of his father & DNA fingerprinting will positively fix or exclude paternity.2. Supposititious or Fictitious Children: Whenever a woman may1. Pretend pregnancy & delivery & later produce a living child as her own2. She may substitute a male child for female child born of her3. For an abortion-These things are done for obtaining money or for the purpose of claiming property.-Other legal issues involved are blackmailing a man or bringing a charge of breech of promise of marriage against a man. In such cases, the woman should be examined for signs of pregnancy and delivery.-In these cases, medical evidence is useful only when the age of the supposititious child does not correspond to the date of the pretended delivery.-DNA fingerprinting will be conclusive.3. Paternity: Remember, that the question of paternity arises in contests (i) Over legitimacy, (ii) Posthumous births, or (iii) Supposititious children.-Paternity is determined from:-Parental likeness: Child may resemble father (in feature, figure, gesture & other personal peculiarities) - Regarded as corroborative evidence only.-Atavism: Child does not resemble its parents, but resembles grandparents. (Due to inheritance of characteristics & due to genes)-Developmental Defects: Like disease or deformities (transmitted from parents to children).-Blood Group Tests or Paternity Tests: Because, blood groups are transmitted from the parents to children-DNA fingerprintingImportant Terminology to be Remembered!oMantle Child: A child born out of wedlock and later legitimated when the parents get married, traditionally by standing under a cloak with the parents during the marriage ceremony.oNatural child: A child by birth as distinguished from an adopted child.oNeglected child: A child whose parents or legal custodians are unfit to care for him or her because of cruelty, immorality or incapacity.-Capacity in this context could be physical or economic.oLegal Problems Artificial Insemination:-No statutory law in India for artificial insemination.-Remember! Artificial insemination with the semen of the husband is justifiable and unobjectionable.-The following are the legal aspects of A.I.D. as applicable to India.1. Adultery: Donor and recipient cannot be held guilty of adultery in India, as S. 497, I.PC.2. Legitimacy: Husband is not the actual father of the child which is illegitimate & cannot inherit property3. Nullity of Marriage & Divorce: Mere Artificial insemination is not ground for nullity of marriage or divorce.4. Natural Birth: Artificial inseminated child remains illegitimate unless A.I. child is adopted, when there is a natural born child (remains legitimate)5. Unmarried Woman or Widow: May have a child from A.I. but that child would be illegitimate.6. Incest: Risk of incest between children born by A.I and children of donor (It is not an offence in India).oSurrogate Motherhood: Legal problems of Surrogate motherhood are similar to those of Artificial insemination donor."

Solid blast : Explosive is detonated near a rigid/solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal; fracture of legs and veebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung"

    "explanation": "Ans. C: Tremors The central adrenergic storm that occurs during alcohol withdrawal results in hyperventilation, tachycardia, hypeension, tremor, hypehermia, and diaphoresis. Head and neck findings Stigmata of chronic alcoholism (e.g., flushed facies, vascular spider angiomata) may be present. - Paralysis of extraocular muscles and nystagmus may indicate Wernicke encephalopathy or other intracerebral processes. Chest findings in alcohol withdrawal - Tachypnea is expected during alcohol withdrawal, but dyspnea is not expected. Cardiac findings - Tachycardia and hypeension are common and expected during alcohol withdrawal. Abdominal findings - Stigmata of chronic alcoholism include caput medusae, ascites, and hepatomegaly. CNS findings - Alcohol withdrawal results in a progressive sequence of increasing anxiety, agitation, confusion, disorientation, - visual and auditory hallucinations, seizures, dysphoria, panic, and potentially violent attacks on others. Dysphoria due to opioid withdrawal may also promote negative reactions and possible violence in affected patients but are not associated with delirium. - Cranial-nerve deficits may indicate wernicke's encephalopathy (ocular nerve palsies), intracranial trauma, or bleeding - The essential features are a coarse tremor of the hands, tongue and eyelids with at least one of the above mentioned symptoms."

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Phosphorous poisoning o Phossy jaw is caused by phosphorus poisoning. All phosphorus poisoning are caused by white (yellow) phosphorus (Red phosphorus is nontoxic).Phosphorus poisoningo Phosphorus is a protoplasmic poison affecting cellular oxidation and causing anoxic necorbiosis, classically affecting liver. It increases fat deposition and inhibits glycogen deposition in liver. It is used in fire works (Diwali poisoning) and as rat poison. Lethal dose is 60-120 mg.o Phosphorus occurs in two forms:-1) White/yellow phosphorus: It is white, and becomes yellow on exposure to air. It is translucent, waxy, luminous and crystalline cylinders. It has garlic like odor. It is insoluble in water and luminous in dark. Its fumes show phosphorescence.2) Red phosphorus : It is reddish brown, inert, odourless and tasteless. It is nontoxic (thus poisoning occurs only due to white phosphorus). It is put on the sides (striking surface) of match box (along with powdered galss).Acute poisoningo It has following stages:i) 1st Stage (GI irritation): There is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and garlic odor. This stage lasts for 8 hours to 3 days.ii) 2nd Stage (Asymptomatic): This stage lasts for 3 days.iii) 3rd Stage: There is liver and kidney damage due to absorbed phosphorus. Initially liver is enlarged due to acute fatty infiltration. Later liver shruks due to necrosis, i.e. acute yellow atrophy.Chronic poisoningo Toothache is the first symptom which is associated with loosening of teeth, necrosis of gums and osteomyelitis of jaw. Therefore chronic phosphorus poisoning is also know as phossy jaw (or glass jaw).Postmortem appearanceo There is garlic odor. Viscera and stool glow in dark (due to luminosity).o To preserve luminosity, viscera are preserved in saturated saline solution. Rectified spirit is not used as it causes loss of luminosity."

    ],
    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Most drugs taken in overdose are extensively detoxified by the liver to produce inactive metabolites which are voided in the urine. Sometimes hepatic degradation produces active metabolites, but the secondary compounds are then conveed to non-toxic derivatives. Under these circumstances, forced diuresis is inappropriate. The procedure should be undeaken only if the following conditions are satisfied: # A substantial propoion of the drug is excreted unchanged. # The drug is distributed mainly in the extracellular fluid. # The drug is minimally protein-bound. # Principle-- Most drugs are weak electrolytes and exist paly as undissociated molecules at physiological pH. The extent of ionisation is a function of the ionisation constant of the drug (Ka for both acids and bases), and the pH of the medium in which it is dissolved. Ionisation constants are usually expressed in the form of their negative logarithm, pKa. Hence the pKa scale is analogous to the pH notation : the stronger an acid the lower its pKa, and the stronger a base the higher its pKa. Thus when pKa = pH, the concentrations of ionised and non-ionised drugs are equal. Cell membranes are most permeable to substances that are lipid soluble and in the non-ionised, rather than the ionised form. Thus the rate of diffusion from the renal tubular lumen back into the circulation is decreased when a drug is maximally ionised. Because ionisation of acidic drugs is increased in an alkaline environment, and that of basic drugs is increased in an acid solution, manipulation of the urinary pH enhances renal excretion. # Forced alkaline diuresis : This is most useful in the case of phenobarbitone, lithium, and salicylates. Administer 1500 ml of fluid IV, in the first hour as follows : - 500 ml of 5% dextrose - 500 ml of 1.2 or 1.4% sodium bicarbonate - 500 ml of 5% dextrose. # Forced acid diuresis : Forced acid diuresis is no longer recommended for any drug or poison, including amphetamines, strychnine, quinine or phencyclidine.

It usually appears 7 days after death. It is a sign of Maceration in a dead-born child. Still Stillbornad-born child Still born child is one, which is bom after 28th wk of pregnancy and which did not breathe or show any other signs of life, at any time after being completely bom The child was alive in utero, but ied during the process of birth. Dead born child a dead bom child is one which has died in utero, and shows one of the following signs Rigor mortis at delivery Maceration This is the process of aseptic autolysis of the fetus dead in utero and is the usual change It occurs when the dead fetus remains in the uterus for 3-4 days surrounded by liquor amnii but with the exclusion of air, It does not occur if the dead fetus is bom within about 24 hrs. It is characterised by softening and degeneration of tissues. The process is aseptic because the fetus is enclosed in the membranes in a sterile condition. * Signs of maceration are The earliest sign of maceration is skin slippage which can be seen in 12 hrs after the death of the child in utero. Appearance of gas in heart and great vessels (Robert's sign) Collapse of the vertebral column The body of the macerated fetus is soft, flaccid and flattens out when placed on a level surface. It has a sweetish disagreeable odour. The skin is red or purple Large blebs appear at 24 hrs which contains thin fluid The epidermis detaches easily and leaves moist and greasy areas. The umbilical cord is thickened and soft The bony junctions both in the skull and in this joints are lax and abnormally mobile. Spalding sign is seen * If the membranes are ruptured after the death of the fetus and air enters into liquor amnii, the fetus undergoes putrefaction instead of maceration. 3) Mummification Mummification results when the death of a fetus occurs from a deficient supply of blood or when liquor amnii is scanty, and when no air has entered the uterus. The fetus is dried up & shrivelled."

    "explanation": "Ans. C: Absence of brainstem reflexes Brainstem is responsible for the respiratory drive and mostly for the maintenance of BP. All motor outputs from the brain travel through the brainstem. Apa from smell and vision. All sensory traffic coming into the brain comes through the brainstem. The brainstem also mediates the cranial nerve reflexes. Hence a properly functioning brain stem is a precondition for full consciousness. Irreversible brain damage and loss of brain function, is evidenced by cessation of breathing and other vital reflexes (mediated by brain stem), unresponsiveness to stimuli, absence of muscle activity, and a flat electroencephalogram for a specific length of time."

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Cooling of body ALGOR MORTISo After death, dead body behaves like an inert substance and therefore, if atmospheric temperature is low, body loses its heat by conduction, covection, radiation and evaporation, so as to attain the atmospheric temperature, i.e. the body cools. No cooling of dead body occurs if atmospheric temperature is higher than that of body,o Cooling of body starts 1/2 to 1 hour after death. There are varying opinions about rate of cooling of dead body:i) Most widely accepted view is that the rate of cooling in india (tropical countries) is 0.5-0.76 C/hour, so that body attains atmospheric temperature in 16-20 hours after death. In temperate climate, the rate of fall is about 1.5deg C/hour.As per another view, cooling is faster in initial period, when the temprature difference between body and atmosphere is maximum -First 30-45 minutes - No temperature fall (isothermic phase).First 1-6 hours - 1.5-2deg C/hour.6-12 hours - 0.9- 1.20 C/hour.After 12 hours - 0.4-0.60 C/hour.Rate of cooling is related to difference in temperature and its surroundings (environment). In the first 2 hours average rate fall of temperature is roughly half this difference. In next 2 hours the temperature fall is at half this rate and in subsequent 2 hours, at quarter this rate.Most common site for recording temperature is the rectum. Thermameter is inserted in rectum around 8-10 cm for 2 minutes. Other sites for recording temperture are nose, ear (external auditory meatus), vagina and under liver.o Medicolegal importance of algor mortis -It is a sign of death.Time since death may be determined and and algor mortis is the most important indicator to determine the time since death during first 24 hours."

    "explanation": "Ans. d (Arterial bleed)The antemortem abrasions show signs of inflammation and repair and a little swelling is present in the area whereas these signs are absent in postmortem abrasions.As abrasions alone are not too significant; not much of importance is placed on them.The other part is that the ants attack the dead body and hence there may be additional injuries found in the form of abrasions besides those mentioned in the FIR. Thus there will be some difference between the two but this is not significant provided the additional abrasions are found in the areas described earlier (Post mortem) and thebody was examined after a lapse of time. Thus the characters of such abrasions should be noted and if found of PM nature, they should be ignored as they are of no value but if they are described as antemortem abrasions, the issue may be argued accordingly. Those points which cannot be argued out because the findings given are inadequate, such points may be elicited cunningly in scientific cross examination."

Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin. Samples to be preserved for chemical analysis * Blood * Routine viscera * Lung * Brain * Hea * Spleen is considered as best specimen due to presence of more RBCs.

Electric bums may be of following typesContact burns : Due to contact with live wire.Spark burns : Due to sparking of current, e.g. in loose electrical fitting.Flash burns : Caused on being near the main powrer line, without actual contact. Bums result due to arcing of current from these lines.o Characteristic features of electric burns areThere may be holes in clothes or shoes.There is a wound of entry and wound of exit of electric currentEntry wound : It is non-bleeding, thick, leathery, greyish white, depressed, hard and cauliflower like, known as crater formation. High voltage current may cause bums over large areas of skin, i.e. crocodile skin lesions. The skin may get coloured due to metallic pigment: green (in brass electrode), black (in iron electrode), blue (in copper electrode) and grey (in aluminium electrode),Exit wound : It is like a laceration and is bleeding.Metals from electrode may melt and as small balls (current pearls) may be carried to tissue. Calcium phosphate of bones may also melt and is radiologically seen as bone pearls (wax dripping).Muscles show Zenker's degeneration.Causes of deatho Commonest cause of death is ventricular fibrillation.

Moreover, Methyl alcohol is commonly used to adulterate ethyl alcohol. Impoant facts related to Methanol poisoning: 1) Cheap liquor is commonly adulterated by Methanol which leads to toxicity after consumption by poor people. Adulteration with Methanol is done because it is presumed to give the kick effect earlier with a smaller dose. Methanol is cheap and easily available. 2) Methanol as such is not a toxic agent. Methanol is metabolized to formaldehyde (by alcohol dehydrogenase) and then to formic acid (by aldehyde dehydrogenase), and these metabolites of methanol are responsible for retinal toxicity as well as metabolic acidosis. 3) Ethanol or 4 methyl pyrazole (fomepizole) are used for the treatment of methanol poisoning. They preferentially compete with methyl alcohol for the same enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and prevents the metabolism of methanol which is then excreted unchanged in the urine."

The points that are usually required to be determined regarding stains are : (1) nature of stain (whether the stains is blood or not); (2) the species (human or animal) from which the blood has come from; and (3) blood group.Nature of stain (whether the stain is blood or not)o To determine the nature of stain, following tests are used :Chemical testsThese tests are based on the peroxidase activity of haematin, which is, derived from oxidation of haem of haemoglobin or methemoglobin, present. This enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide converts colourless salts into coloured bases. Thus these tests are based on H202 and peroxidase enzyme. Tests are :Benzidine test: Greenish blue colour.Phenolphthalein test (kastle myere test): Deep permanganate colour.Leucomalachite green test: Bluish green or peacock blue colour.Guaiacum test: Blue colour.Orthotoludine test (kohn test): Blue or green colour.Amidopyrine test: Purple colour.Microchemical testsThese tests are based on property of haem part of hemoglobin to form characteristic coloured crystals. The tests are :Teichmann's haemin crystal test.Takayama hemochromogen crystal test.Luminal spray test: It is especially useful in old obscure blood stains.SpetroscopyIt is most delicate and reliable test. It is based on the principle that hemoglobin and its derivatives givecharacteristic absorption bands when viewed through a spectroscope.MicroscopyMicroscopic examination of RBCs is possible only in fresh stains.Detection of species (whether the blood has come from human or animal)o For detection of species, serological (immunological) tests are used. These tests are :Precipitin testHaemaglutination inhibition test (antiglobulin consumption test or absorption inhibition test).Gel diffusion test.Double diffusion test.Precipitation electrophoresis.Latex agglutination test.Isoenzyme method (enzymological test).Detection of blood group of blood staino These tests are :Immunological (serological) : (i) aborption-elution test, (ii) absorption-inhibition test, (iii) mixed agglutinationtest, (iv) latex test.Enzymological methods.Latte fs crust method."

Primary blast injury affects air-filled structures such as the lungs, ears, and GI tract the following mechanisms: spalling (e.g., from lung parenchyma to alveolar space, causing tissue surfaces to explode geyser-like); shearing, due to differential ineia (e.g., pulmonary vessels and air spaces), resulting in ruptured vascular and bronchial pedicles; and implosion of flexible air spaces, which rebound to greater than original size, resembling miniexplosions.

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "(A) Odourless[?]Mummification:oMummification is a modification of putrefaction.o\"Mummified body is practically odourless\".oMummified body will smell odourless, this is because the internal organs are removed (which are the biggest factors in the decay process) and replaced with natron (which dries them out, preventing 'proper' decay).oDehydration or drying & shrivelling of cadaver occurs from the evaporation of water,oPreservation of natural appearances and features of body.oMummification begins in exposed parts of the body - like face, hands & feet followed to entire body & internal organs.oMummified Skin is shrunken & contracted, dry, brittle, leathery & rusty-brown in colour, stretched tightly across anatomical prominences.oMummified tissues are dry, leathery and brown in colour. The face will be greatly distorted due to shrinkage of soft tissues.oMummified internal organs shrunken, hard, dark-brown and black and become a single mass or may disappear. Collagen, elastic tissues, cardiac & skeletal muscle, cartilage, and bone.oMummified body loses weight, becomes thin, stiff and brittle.oFactors for production of mummification: -Absence of moisture in the air-Continuous action of dry or warmed air.-Marked dehydration before death favours development of mummification.-Mummification favoured by Chronic arsenic or antimony poisoning.-Mummification occurs in body buried in shallow graves in dry sand soils (hot dry winds in summer)oTime required for complete mummification varies from 3 months to 1 year.[?]Medico-legal impoartance of Mummification:-Establish the identity (when the process involves the face, the features are well preserved).-Cause of death can be determined (injuries are recognised).-Time since death can be estimated.Other Options[?]Adipocere (Suponificaiton)-It is a modification of putrefaction, in which fatty tissues of the body change into a substance 'adipocere' & commonly in bodies immersed in water or in damp, warm environment.-Adipocere is due to gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of pre-existing fats.-Adipocere has a distinct offense or sweetish smell & penetrating ammonical odour noticed during early stages.VARIOUS ODOURS NOTICED IN THE BODY[?]Smell about the mouth and nose: Substances which may be recognized by their odour are-Garlick-like: Phosphorus, arsine gas, arsenic (breath and perspiration), thallium, selenium, dimethylsulphoxide, tellurium, parathion, malathion.-Sweet or fruity: Ethanol, chloroform, nitrites,-Acrid: Paraldehyde, chloral hydrate.-Rotten eggs: Hydrogen sulphide, Mercaptans, Disulfiram.-Fishy or musty: Zinc phosphide.-Other substances are: Cyanides, Phenol, Opium, Ether, Camphor, etc."

This is so because action alobe doesnot amount to guilt unless if is accompanied by a guilty mind. And, a child of that tender age cannot have a guilty mind or criminal intention with which the act is done. This presumption, however, is only confined to offenses under the IPC but not to other Acts, e.g., the Railway Act.83A child above seven and under twelve years of age is presumed to be capable of committing an offence it he has obtained sufficient maturity to understand and judge the nature and conse- quences of his conduct on that occasion. The lawr presumes such maturity in a child of that age unless the contrary is proved by the defence.89A child under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent to suffer any harm which can occur from an act done in good faith and for its benefit, e.g., a consent for an operation. Only, a guardian can give such consent.87A person under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent, whether express or implied, to suffer any harm which may result from an act no intended or not known to cause death or grievous hurt e.g. consent for a wrestling contest.84Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is uncapable of knowing the nature of act (i.e. it is wrong or contrary' to law).85,86Drunkness and criminal responsibility"

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Vessels appearing as prominent lines * The signs and effects of putrefaction are as follows:1) Colour changes# The earliest sign of decomposition is greenish discoloration of body, seen in right iliac fossa externallyand under liver internally. This is due to involvement of caecum. Which contains more liquid and is full of bacteria. In these areas, it appears in 12-18 hours and slowly spread to whole body in 24-48 hours. Greenish discoloration is due to formation ofsulph-meth-haemoglobin.# Morbling occurs when Hb dissociates from RBCs and the colour of Hb is taken up by vessels, which are seen as prominent lines having purple or green or brown colour. Marbling occurs in 24-48 hours.2) Formation of foul smelling gases# Due to action of bacteria, foul smelling gases are formed, e.g. S02, H2S, ammonia, methane and COv3) Effects of gases# Bloating up of body occurs in 34-48 hours. At the same time following changes occurs:i) Appearance of stomach contents and froth on nose and mouth.ii) Degloving and destocking with appearance of putrifactive blisters.iii) Emptying of heart due to pressure of gas.# In 48-72 hours prolapse of rectum and uterus occur and postmortem delivery may occur if the dead woman is pregnant. Color of postmortem staining also changes to brown and finally to black. False rigidity (putrefactive rigidity) may occur at this time.4) Appearance of maggots# Flies lay their eggs in wounds, exposed natural orifices and exposed moist parts of the body and folds of skin, e.g. neck, axilla, nostrils, mouth etc.# Flies lay eggs in 6-12 hours after death and these eggs change in larva (maggot) in 1-2 days.# Thus maggots appear in 2-3 days after the death.# After further 4-5 days, the maggots change into pupa, which convert into adult flies in next 3-5 days.# Thus adult flies will be coming out of the body after total 8-12 days of death.* Appearance of maggot determine the time since death.5) Other late changes# In 3-5 days: Nails and teeth become loose and can be pulled out, sutures of skull may separate.# In 7-12 days: Liquefaction of body (colliquative putrefaction) occurs.# In 1-3 months : Skeletonization of dead body occurs.# Finally: Bones also decompose: Exposed bones in 1-5 years and deep burried bone (> 2 meters) in 25-100 years.6) Internal changes# Liver becomes spongy and is called as foamy or swiss cheese or honeycombed liver.# In 7-12 days lequefaction of internal organs occur.7) Floatation of body (if body is in water)# Floatation of body occurs due to accumulation of sufficient putrefactive gases. Abdomen is above (due to gases) and spine is below during floatation.# Time required for floatation is ordinarily 24 hours after death in summers and 2-3 days in winter.# Factors affecting floatation are :i) Causing early floatation: Newborn mature infant, females, in summer, clothed body, obese, in sea water and in still pond water.ii) Causing delayed floatation : Still birth/immature newborn, male, in winter, naked body, thin built, in fresh water and in running stream water.# Inspiration and expiration before death has no effect on floatation as floatation is due to putrefactive gases (not due to respiratory air)."

Principle: Blood serum contains proteins in colloidal suspension ,and when human serum is injected into an animal,the animal become immunised against these proteins and antibodies develop in its blood .If human serum is then brought into contact with this animal serum,the antibodies in the animal serum react with the proteins in the human serum and a visible precipitate forms. The antibodies causing this reaction are known as precipitins and the animal serum is known as antihumam precipitin serum.A rabbit or a fowl is injected with human blood every third day for 3 to 5 injections. after thuis animal is killed and the antiserum is collected. A suitable antiserum should react immmediately or within a minute on the 1:1000 dilution Application of the test: It is a specific protein test, and the reaction demonstrates the presence of albuminous substances obtained from any pa of human body. the origin of skin, flesh,bone or even secretions such as saliva ,milk and semen is determined by this test."

Investigation of Offences on Human Body by Apurba Nandy p48Two types of marks are seen on the surface of the bullet and help in identification of the firearm used.Primary markings (Class characteristics):In all rifled firearms, the bullet is slightly larger than the barrel, and as the bullet passes through the barrel, its sides are marked by the rifling of the barrel. These are k/a primary markings.Primary markings or Class characteristics include- caliber number of lands and grooves {these 2 terms used in describing the rifling found inside the barrel of a firearm. The word lands refers to the raised portion of the rifling, and the grooves refers to the lower portion of the rifling.) direction of the twist of rifling rate of twist of the rifling width of the land and groovesPrimary markings help in identifying the make and model of the firearm used.Secondary markings (individual or accidental characteristics):These markings are caused by irregularities on the inner surface of the barrel which are specific for that particular weapon. These irregularities are produced by the sticking of the particles of the bullet to the bore when shots are fired (this is k/a metallic fouling). Individual characteristics also result accidentally during the manufacturing process.Secondary markings help iii identifying the specific gun from which the bullet was fired."

    ],
    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Ans. A: Burns The burnt body presents the so called attitude of defense, known as boxing attitude, pugilistic attitude or fenching posture Terminology commonly discussed in relation with thermal injuries in forensic pathology: 1. Cherry red lividity In individuals with a significant carboxyhemoglobin concentration in the blood (due to carbon monoxide exposure), the livor mois has a distinctive, bright, cherry red color. The affinity of carbon monoxide to bind to hemoglobin is 200-250% that of oxygen. Cyanide may also produce a bright red coloration of the blood and muscles of the body and has a characteristic bitter almond smell. 2. Epidural hematoma In burned bodies, epidural hematoma results from blood and marrow in the cancellous diploe of the skull boiling and being extruded by the intense heat, resulting in a brown, granular, and at times foamy or dried and flaky deposit in the epidural space. This is also a postmoem heat-related aifact and is easily distinguished from an antemoem epidural hematoma by the difference in color and texture. Fuhermore, antemoem hematomas are often associated with linear skull fractures, with injury to the middle meningeal aery. 3. Fire fractures Fire fractures are another postmoem heat-related aifact and should not be confused with antemoem injuries. Because of the extreme heat, the muscle, tendons, and soft tissue are charred, resulting in exposure of the underlying bones to heat, with resultant heat-induced fractures. Skull fractures are usually seen on the temporal bones, often radiating from a central point. The fractured edges are ragged and may cross suture lines, unlike antemoem fractures that usually terminate at suture lines. Additionally, these fractures may be of paial thickness, with exposure of the cancellous layer. 4. Lichtenberg figure, ferning, keraunopathy Keraunopathy is most generally the study of lightning-related injury, and the term is also used occasionally as synonymous with ferning, the arborizing pattern of skin discoloration seen on some bodies after a lightning strike. The finding can be seen on both living individuals surviving a lightning strike and those dying of it. The Lichtenberg figure is another term for this same finding. Lichtenberg figures, or ferning, on the human body can be transient, lasting hours to days, and their cause remains unclear. 5. Pugilistic attitude The burned body assumes what appears to be a boxer's stance. This is a postmoem aifact resulting from the effects of heat on the muscle protein: denaturation and dehydration. The flexors are bulkier than the extensors, and hence, the overall effect is one of contractures, with flexion at the elbows, wrists and knees. Often the joint spaces are exposed and the aiculating surfaces of the bones are charred. Pugilistic attitude as a result of heat-related contractures. In fire-related deaths, heat-induced contractures result in exposure of the peripheral joint spaces, with charring of the aiculating surface of the bones. 6. Skin splits Skin splits are usually seen on or near joint surfaces, the extensor surfaces of the extremities, and the head. These splits can extend to the underlying adipose and skeletal muscle, dependent on the intensity of the heat. These are also a postmoem aifact. The muscles split parallel to the long axes of the myofibers rather than across them. The soft-tissue splits may be full thickness, paicularly on the abdomen, resulting in charring of the exposed bowel surface. Skin and subcutaneous splits due to intense heat. 7. Soot Soot is an amorphous black material found in the airways (mouth, nares, trachea, bronchi) of individuals inhaling smoke during a fire. Its presence in the airways at autopsy indicates that the decedent was breathing and thus alive during the fire."

    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., It is developed in presence of air Adipocere formation (saponification). Adipocere is a modification of putrefaction, which occurs in the absence of air. That is when there is excessive moisture (humidity) and warnth (warm temperature), but absence of air i.e. warm humid climate, normal putrefaction does not occur, rather saponification occurs. Thus adipocese formation occurs in dead bodies which are lying in water (immered in water) or burned in damp lay soil. Saponification (adipocer formation) is the conversion of dead body into soft, fatty waxy substance due to conversion of unsaturated liquid fats to saturated solid fats under the influence of intrinsic lipase and lecithinase produced by Cl. perfringens. The process involves gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of body fats into higher fatty acids which combine with calcium and ammonium ions to form insoluble soaps. Ultimately, palmitic, oleic, stearic and hydroxystearic acids are formed, mixture of these is known as adipocere. Adipocere formation stas in subcutaneous fat and is marked in areas having excessive fat, eg. cheeks, female breast, buttocks and abdomen. Slowly the whole body including muscles and internal viscera change into adipocere. Adipocere has offensive or sweetish smell, however in early stages, smell is ammonical. Body is conveed into soft, waxy and brittle substance, it floats on water, it can be cut easily, it dissolves in alcohol and ethers, and it melts on heating. Facial features and injuries on body are well preserved, thus identfication of body and determination cause of death (in case of injury) are possible. Normally adipocere formation requires 3 weeks to upto 3 to 6 months. However shoest recorded period in india is 3 days 22 hours. In india, it has been observed to begin within 4-5 days. Adipocere may persist for years or decades. Adipocere does not occur in foetus less than 7 month's. Medicolegal impoance : (i) Identification of body (facial features are preserved), (ii) cause of death (injury marks are preserved), (iii) time since death can be estimated."

In this disorder, people restrict their breathing (paial asphyxiation) at or near the time of orgasm to enhance the experience. Typically, people use aicles of clothing (eg, scarves, underwear) as a ligature to choke themselves. The ligature is often suspended from an object in the room (eg, doorknob, bedpost). Loss of consciousness can occur rapidly because obstruction of venous return from the brain impairs cerebral perfusion even before hypoxia and hypercarbia become significant. People who asphyxiate themselves in such a way that the ligature does not release if they lose consciousness can inadveently have permanent brain damage or die."

Thus, its measurement more accurately reflects nervous system organophosphorus acetyl cholinesterase inhibition.\nPlasma cholinesterase is a liver acute-phase protein, circulates in the blood plasma. It is found in CNS white mater, pancreas and heart. It can be affected by many factors, including pregnancy, infection and medical illness. Additionally, a patient's level can vary up to 50% with repeated testing.\nThus, RBC cholinesterase is more accurate of the two measurements, but plasma cholinesterase is easier to assay and is more readily available."

    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Chronic lead Poisoning (plumbism; saturnism): Chronic poisoning results from a daily intake of one to two mg of lead. Signs and Symptoms : (1) Facial Pallor : The facial pallor paicularly about the mouth is one of the earliest and most consistent sign. It seems to be due to vasospasm. (2) Anaemia : There may be polycythaemia with polychromatophilia in early stages, but later there is anaemia which is associated with polychromasia, punctate basophilia, reticulocytosis, poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, nucleated red cells (sideroblasts) and an increase in mononuclear cells, whereas polymorphonuclear cells and platelets are decreased. The anaemia is due to inhibition of haeme synthesis by interference with the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin. 3 )Leadline : A stippled blue line, called Buonian line, is seen on the gums in 50 to 70% of cases. It appears due to subepithelial deposit of granules at the junction with teeth, only near diy or carious teeth, within a week of exposure, especially on upper jaw. It is due to formation of lead sulphide by the action of hydrogen sulphide formed by decomposed food in the mouth. 4) Colic and Constipation : (5) Lead Palsy: There may be tremors, numbness, hyperaesthesia, and cramps before the actual muscle weakness. It is commoner in adults than in children, and men are paicularly affected. The muscle groups affected are those most prone to fatigue. Usually the extensor muscles of the wrist (wrist drop; radial nerve is affected) are affected, but the deltoid, biceps, anterior tibial (foot drop), and rarely muscles of eye or intrinsic muscles of hand or foot are affected. The paralysis is associated with degeneration of the nerve and atrophy of the muscles. Recovery may be complete but is usually slow. ( 6) Encephalopathy :*Lead encephalopathy, in some form is said to be present in almost every case of plumbism. It is common in children often associated with tetraethyl lead. The symptoms are vomiting, headache, insomnia, visual disturbances, irritability, restlessness, delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, coma and death. Lead encephalopathy is usually irreversible and about 85% have permanent brain damage. Death occurs in about 25% cases. (7) Cardiovascular System and Kidneys : Lead causes vascular constriction, leading to hypeension and permanent aeriolar degeneration. Chronic aeriosclerotic nephritis and interstitial nephritis occur. (8) Reproductive System : Menstrual derangements, such as amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, sterility of both sexes, and aboion are frequent. Aboion occurs in pregnant women between 3 to 6 months. (9) Other Systems : They are dyspepsia, anorexia, emaciation, general weakness, exhaustion, irritability, foul breath, headache, veigo, loss of hair and drowsiness. Peripheral neuritis is rare. Retinal stippling is noticed by ophthalmoscopic examination showing presence of greyish glistening lead paicles in the early phase of poisoning. Ref:- k.s.narayan reddy; pg num:- 544"

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Non-responding muscles Death denotes death of human being (46 IPC). It is defined as cessation of life or cesation to exist. Death is of two types (1) somatic death (systemic death or clinical death) and (2) molecular death (cellular death). Somatic death (systemic death or clinical death) It is the complete and irreversible stoppage of the circulation, respiration and brain functions (bishop's tripod of life). Somatic death is associated with immediate signs of death :? Permanent and complete cessation of function of brain and flat electric EEG with no response to external stimuli; i.e. brain death. Permanent and complete cessation of function of hea and flat ECG. Permanent and complete cessation of function of lungs. Somatic death is due to stopped aerobic processes. However, anaerobic enzymatic processes are still continuing, hence (i) muscles still respond to mechanical, electrical and thermal stimuli, (ii) pupils still respond to miotics and mydriatics. Molecular death (cellular death) It occurs after somatic death. It refers to death of all individual cells. It occurs when even anaerobic processes stop, due to non availability of ATP. At this stage : Muscles do not respond to stimuli. Pupils do not respond to stimuli or drugs. There are early signs and late signs of death : Early signs : Changes in skin and eye, cooling of the body, post-moem lividity, changes in muscles (e.g. primary relaxation, rigor mois). Late signs : Decomposition (putrefaction), adipocere fromation and mummification. 4. Molecular death of various organs occur at different intervals after somatic death : Nervous tissue --> After 5 minutes. Liver ---> After 15 minutes. Hea --> After 45 minutes. Kidney --> After 1 hours. Muscles --> After 3 hours. Cornea --> After 6 hours. Blood After 6 hours."

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., None of the above All are true. Summon Summon is a legal document compelling attendance of a witness in a cou of law under penalty, on a paicular day, time and place, for the purpose of giving evidence. It is issued by the Cou in writting, in duplicate, signed by presiding officer of cou and bears the seal of the cou. Conduct money refers to the travelling and daily expences to reach the cou. In civil cases, it is paid by the pay calling him, at the time of serving the summon. Judge decides the conduct money in civil case. The summon in civil case can be ignored if conduct money is not sanctioned or if the amount is less, and the witness can bring the fact to notice of judge. In criminal cases, no money is paid along with summon. The witness can ask for it, after giving evidence, but he should not insist if the cou is not willing to sanction, since otherwise he can be charged for contempt of cou. To an independent doctor it is always paid (known as bhatta), while the doctor in government service, can claim from his office. In case, two or more summons are received for the same date and time, the principles for preference of summon are: Criminal case is preferred over civil case. If both cases are criminal/civil, summon from higher cou is preferred. If both cases are criminal/civil and from cou of same status, summon received earlier is preferred. However, in each situation other cou is informed accordingly."

D: Datura poisoning If the patient has bilateral pinpoint pupils consider the following possible etiologies: Opiate use/abuse/overdose such as Heroin, Fentanyl, Codeine, Methadone and Morphine stimulate the parasympathetic side of the autonomic nervous system and cause pupil constriction. Miosis in combination with depressed respirations are the hallmark signs of opiate overdose. Pontine Hemorrhage The pons is a knob-like structure located at the front of the brainstem. Intracranial hemorrhage in the area of the pons will typically cause bilateral pupil constriction. Intracranial hemorrhage can have both traumatic and atraumatic origins. Consider pontine hemorrhage in the presence of high mechanism head trauma and patients with a history of vascular disease, strokes and abnormal bleeding. Organophosphate / Chemical / Nerve Agent Exposure Organophosphate chemicals are the most common chemicals causing parasympathetic over-stimulation and, therefore, pinpoint pupils. These compounds are effective pesticides used in agriculture. They are widely used because they break down easily in the environment unlike their cousin DDT. Malathion and parathion are examples of organophosphate pesticides. These chemicals kill insects by disrupting their nervous system function. They can be absorbed through the skin, inhaled and ingested. Once absorbed they shut down acetylcholiesterase production and put the parasympathetic system into overdrive. This will create the classic SLUDGE presentation, characterized by excessive salivation, lacrimation (tears), urination, defecation and emesis. And two other telltale signs muscle cramps and pinpoint pupils. Pupils are widely dilated with loss of accommodation for near vision is seen in datura poisoning."

It is usless when there is decomposition. when disected under water, the stomach shows mucus, saliva and air bubbles if respiration has taken place, and only mucus if breathing has not occured. Blood, meconium or liquor amnii in the stomach indicate that the child was alive at or sholy before bih.

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "Velocity of bullet Repeat from May 09 Mechanics of Bullet Injury A bullet's ability to produce tissue injury depends on: Bullet velocity- A bullet's ability to injure is directly related to its kinetic energy at the moment of impact. Kinetic energy i.e. E = me /2 The kinetic energy is directly propoional to weight (mass) of the bullet and the square of its velocity. Thus a bullet traveling at twice the speed of a second bullet of equal weight and similar size and shape, possesses four times much energy and injuring power. Tissue density- The greater the tissue density, the greater is the amount of energy discharged by the bullet passing through it and thus greater the injury. Thus a bullet may cause slight damage to the soft tissue, but extensive damage to hard tissue such as bone. Hydrostatic force- Hydrostatic forces increase the impact of injury. When fluid distended hollow organs, (e.g. urine filled bladder, filled stomach, hea filled with blood in diastole) are hit by a bullet, extensive lacerations are produced due to the explosive displacement of the liquid in all directions."

These includea) Sadism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on ones partner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc.b) Lust murder: In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.c) Necrophagia: (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat): This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure.d) Masochism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, tortured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual partner.e) Necrophilia: In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants.f) Fetishism: A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm, eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc.g) Transvestism = Eonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interest, and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality.h) Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these parts with several fingers or whole hands (it is an offence when done in public).i) Exhibitionism (Sec 294IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine).j) Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom: Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman.k) Frotteurism: Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone.l) Undinism: In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex.m) Indecent assault (Sec 354 IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual part of either or is sexually favored. In such assaults, a man may try to kiss a woman, press or fondle with her breasts, touch or expose the genitalia or thighs, try to put a finger in her vagina, play with vulva.# A medical practitioner can be accused of indecent assault if he examines a female patient by stripping her clothes without her consent or even with her consent in the absence of a female attendant.# Such assaults are punishable under Sec 354 IPC, upto 2 years imprisonment and/or fine.n) Uranism: General term for perversion of the sexual instinct.o) Satyriasis: Incessant sexual desire.p) Priapism: Painful penile erection in absence of sexual desire."

Thus, they have exactly identical DNA, except for the generally undetectable micromutations that begin as soon as the cell stas dividing. Fingerprints of the identical twins sta their development from the same DNA so they show considerable genetic similarity. However identical twins are situated in different pas of the womb during development, so each fetus encounters slightly different intrauterine forces than their siblings. As a result fingerprints of the identical twins have different microdetails which can be used for identification purposes."

Indian Journal of Experimental Biology;34:384-386, methodscollectionpreservationdna.htm DNA Fingerprinting technique, introduced by Prof. Alec Jeffrey's is widely used presently all over the globe especially for forensic purposes. All living things are composed of different cells and within the cells except red blood cells and few other minor types contain a chemical component called Nucleus. And within the nucleus of each cell is located a genetic material, referred as Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). It is this genetic material which generates genetic pattern of an individual and has shown highly polymorphic among individuals. COMMON BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES ENCOUNTERED: Whole Fresh Blood Blood Stain Seminal Stain Hard Tissues (Bones) Soft Tissues (body organs) Hair METHODS OF COLLECTION: Whole blood Sample: Sterile needle should be used while withdrawing or collecting blood. Blood stain: Should be picked up preferably on sterile cotton gauge using sterile forceps and blade. Seminal stain: Should not be touched by hand especially the stain poion. Should be picked up with sterile forceps. Hard Tissues: Bones-bones should be picked up using gloves, Kept at a place where there are no chances of environmental contamination. It should be allowed to dry completely. Soft Tissues: Body organs should be collected using forces and wearing gloves. It should be kept in a sterile container. Hair: Hair roots are preferred for the analysis. Hair roots should be picked up using sterile forceps. PRESERVATION: Whole Blood: Blood should be collected in sterile container containing an anticoagulant. The mostly preferred is EDTA. It should be mixed properly but gently for some time. The container should be covered with parafilm to avoid slippage. Should be kept it at 4degC or using ice during transpoation till it reaches laboratory for analysis. Blood stain: Blood stain should be dried properly. In semi dry stain there, is a possibility of bacterial growth thus chances of having contamination. Drying should be avoided using electric fans. After complete drying it should be wrapped in a fresh blotting paper and packed in a Zip lock poly bag. No preservative is required. It can be transpoed at environmental temperature. Seminal stain: Likewise seminal stain should also be dried properly. In semi dry stain there, is a possibility of bacterial growth thus chances of having contamination. It should not be dried using electric fans. After drying it should be wrapped in a fresh blotting paper and packed in a Zip lock poly bag. No preservative is required. It can be transpoed at environmental temperature. Hard Tissue: No preservative is required. The hard tissues should be wrapped in the blotting paper and placed in a zip lock poly bag. Soft tissue: It should be placed at 4degC or in Ice till it reaches laboratory for analysis. Hair: Hair roots should be placed in a blotting paper and then packed in a zip lock poly bag.

For this reason, when a body is found in a certain position with rigor mortis fully developed, it cannot be assumed that the deceased necessarily died in that position.# Rigor involves voluntary and involuntary muscles.# Contraction of the arrectores pilorum muscles during rigor may result in \"goose-flesh\" or \"cutis anserina\". The phenomenon is commonly seen in cases of drowning where it is thought to result from an agonal contraction of the muscles.# Involvement of walls of seminal vesicles by rigor may lead to discharge of seminal fluid at the glans penis.# In individuals who have been exhausted or starved before death, the glycogen stores in muscle are low, so that rigor may develop rapidly.# Typically, rigor is first apparent in small muscles of eyelids, lower jaw and neck, followed by the limbs.# It is generally accepted that rigor mortis passes off in the same order in which it develops.# In temperate climates rigor will typically start to disappear at about 36-48 hours after death. However, if the environ- mental temperature is high then the development of putrefaction may completely displace rigor within 9-12 hours of death.# Accelerated putrefaction resulting from ante-mortem septicaemia may lead to a rapid displacement of rigor.# Exposure of a body to intense heat results in heat stiffening due to coagulation of the muscle proteins. Unlike rigor mortis, heat stiffening is associated with muscle shortening resulting in the characteristic pugilistic posture of burned bodies.# Freezing of a body will cause stiffening of the muscles, postponing the development of rigor which is said to developed as soon as thawing of the body permits."

Finger print pattern is absolutely individual i.e. no two hands are entirely alike, not even identical twins. That's why, it is best (most sensitive and most specific) and most reliable method of identification (Quetelet's rule of biological variation). DNA finger printing may be same in monozygotic twins. The pattern is neither inherited nor identical in any two persons. So the paternity cannot be proved through finger print patterns. However, paternity can be proved by DNA finger printing. Loops (67% most common) > whorls (25%) > arches (7%) > composite (2% least common) are four main types of pattern. It is accepted that chances of 2 finger prints matching 16 ridge characteristic are infinitely small (Parikh's). In practice 8 - 16 (Reddy) / 16 - 20 (Seth, Simpson) points of fine comparision are accepted as proof of identity. Locard's poroscopy method is study of microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweat gland present on ridges of fingers. These pores are permanent, remain un changed during life and are very useful when only fragments offingerprints are available. Each milimeter contains 9 - 18 pores. Criminals may attempt to multilate finger prints by applying CO2 snow, corrosive agents, burns or eroding against hard surface. But these manners do not destroy finger prints permanently unless true skin is completely destroyed."

    "label": "B",

That is when there is excess air and warmth but no moisture (humidity), i.e. hot dry and windy climate, mummification takes place in place of normal putrefaction. Thus mummification occurs in deserts, especially in summer and also in bodies buried in shallow grave in sandy soil.* Mummification is characterized by dessication or drying of the dead body. There is drying, dehydration and shriveling of dead body. It proceeds from exterior to interior. Therefore first to be involved is skin, especially of exposed body parts like lips, nose tip, hands (fingers) and feet (toes). The skin is shrunken, contracted, dry, brittle, leathery, streched across bony prominences and rusty brown to black in color. Internal viscera also dry up, darken in color and blend with each other to form a single mass. Body emits smell like rotten cheese. Facial features and injuries are well preserved, thus identification of body and cause of death can be determined (like adipocere formation).* Time required for mummification varies between 3 months - 2 years. If properly preserved, a mummified body can remain for years. Chronic arsenic or antimony poisoning favor mummification.* Medicolegal importance: (i) Identification of body (facial features are preserved), (ii) cause of death (injury marks are preserved), (iii) time since death can be estimated."

The methods used are :? A) Gustafson's method : Useful only in persons older than 21 years of age, depending on the physiological changes in each of the dental tissues. Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel). Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent pa of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis). Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, sta from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde). Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root sta at apex and extend upward (may be pathological). Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria). B) Mile's method : Age can be known by changes of root transparency. Q Boyde' method : On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at bih (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination. D) Stack's method : Age of infant can be known from height and weight of erupting teeth."

They are secondary to raised intracranial pressure with formation of a transtentorial pressure cone involving the cerebral peduncles (crus cerebri) and other midbrain structures caused by raised pressure above the tentorium.Kernohan's notch is a groove in the cerebral peduncle that may be caused by this displacement of the brainstem against the incisura of the tentorium. The resulting ipsilateral hemiparesis is a false localizing sign, known as the Kernohan-Woltman syndrome. This may succeed or accompany temporal lobe (uncal) herniation and subfalcian herniation secondary to a supratentorial mass.The common causes are an acute haematoma, oedema following trauma, abscess, or tumour. The Duret haemorrhage is demonstrated at CT or MRI. It usually indicates a fatal outcome. The mechanism is uncertain, but is probably caused by the displacement of the brainstem stretching and lacerating pontine perforating branches of the basilar artery."

Primary impact injuries (the first pa struck) - These injuries are caused by the first impact between the vehicle and the pedestrian. 2. Secondary impact injuries (fuher injuries by the same vehicle) - These injuries are d/t subsequent impact with the same vehicle, for eg. the pedestrian may be lifted on to the vehicle after the initial impact. 3. Secondary injuries (sometimes also called teiary injuries) - These are the injuries caused d/t the victim falling on the ground or other stationary object. In primary impact injuries, the site and nature of injuries depend on the height of the pedestrian and upon the position of the person in relation to the vehicle when struck, i.e. whether crossing the road from one side to the other walking with or against the traffic. The injuries also depend upon the relative heights of various pas of the vehicle, i.e. bumper, radiator, fenders. In a typical case, the victim is struck by the front of the vehicle. An adult usually sustains injuries on the legs and a child on the head. Fracture of the tibia and, fibula of one or both legs is k/a bumper fracture. - The fracture is usually spiral or wedge shaped. The base of the triangular fragment of bone indicates the site of the impact and the apex points in the direction in which the vehicle was travelling. - In a bumber fracture, the distance from the heel to the ,fracture sire gives information regarding height of the bumper and whether brakes were applied or not. When brakes are applied before the accident, the legs are injured at a lower level. (The .front bumber tends to rise during acceleration and dip under braking.

Atypical drowning It refers to drowning in which even after submersion of body in water, little or no water anters respiratory passages and lungs. Hence typical findings of wet drowning in the form of froth and oedema aquosun: of lungs are not found. Atypical drowning may be : Dry drowning : On contact with water, especially cold water, there results intense laryngospasm, so that water does not enter the lungs. Death is due to asphyxia because of laryngospasm. Immersion syndrome (hydrocution/submersion inhibition/vagal inhibition) : Sudden death occurs due to vagal inhibition as a result of (a) sudden impact with cold water, (b) duck diving (falling in water with feet first), and (c) horizontal entry in water with impact on epigastrium. Submersion of unconscious : If person is unconscious since before submersion in water, little or no water enters respiratory passages. It may occur in MI, cerebrovascular accident, hypeension, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm and in drunk state. Near drowning (secondary drowning syndrome/post immersion syndrome) : In this drowning is survived and death occurs at a later stage after removal from water. Either the person himself comes out of water or he is recovered alive, but due to complications of submersion, he dies at a later stage. It is due to hypoxic encephalopathy and fibrosing alveolitis. The death occurs due to combined effect of cerebral hypoxia, pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonitis, electrolyte disturbances and metabolic acidosis."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Forehead LACERATIONS (Tear or Rupture) Lacerations are tears or splits of skin, mucous membrane and underlying tissue (e.g., muscle or internal organs). Lacerations are produced by application of blunt force to broad area of the body, which crush or stretch tissues beyond the limits of their elasticity. Localized poions of tissue are displaced by the impact of the blunt force, which sets up traction forces and causes tearing of tissues. Features of lacerations are :? i) Hair and hair bulb, nerves and blood vessels are crushed - There may be paralysis (nerve crushed) and hemorrhage is not pronounced (blood vessels crushed). ii) Site of injury is the site of impact. iii) Shape of injury is irregular, margins are irregular and contused/abraded and show tags of tissue. iv) Size of injury does not corresponds to impacting surface. There are following types of laceration : ? 1) Split laceration : Splitting occurs by crushing of skin between two hard objects. Blunt force on areas where the skin is close to rigid structures like bone with scanty subcutaneous tissue, may produce a wound that by linear splitting of tissue may look like incised wound, i.e., incised like or incised looking wound. Examples of such area are scalp, eye brows, cheek bones (zygomatic), lower jaw, iliac crest, perineum and skin. A wound produced by a fall on knee or elbow with limb flexed and by a sharp stone also simulates incised wound. 2) Strech lacerations : Overstretching of the skin, if it is fixed, will cause laceration, for example, by kicking, sudden deformity of bone occurs after fracture, making it compound. 3) Avulsion (shearing laceration) : An avulsion is a laceration produced by sufficient force (shearing force) delivered at an acute angle to detach (tear off) a poion of a traumatized surface or viscus from its attachment, the shearing and grinding force by a weight. Flaying is type of avulsion in which shearing and grinding force by weight (such as of lorry wheel passing over a limb) may produce avulsion (separation of skin from underlying tissue/degloving of a large area). 4) ears : Tears of the skin and tissues can occur from imact by a against irregular or semi-sharp objects, such as door handle of a car. This is another form of overstretching. 5) Cut laceration : Cut lacerations may be produced by a heavy sharp edged instrument."

Overall, the most common site is leg (85%), followed by head (50-80%) > arms > pelvis > chest or abdomen > neck and spine. 2) Secondary impact injuries : These are due to subsequent impact with the same vehicle, as may result from being lifted on to the vehicle after the initial impact:- Secondary impact injuries are also usually seen on the same side as the primary impact injuries (side facing the vehicle) when the body is thrown on the vehicle although they may be seen on other surfaces such as during ran over injuries. If the initial impact was below the centre of gravity (as occurs in adult and older child), it tends to lift the victim up onto bonnet/hood of vehicle (scooping up) or even on road behind the vehicle and cause severe head injuries, laceration (due to secondary impact or contact with windshield) and run over by passing vehicle. If the initial point of impact was at or above the centre of gravity (as occurs in children), he is directly thrown to ground (due to primary impact) and is run over by same car with consequent secondary impact under carriage injuries which may include burns from hot exhaust pipe and stains from grease oil etc. 3) Secondary injuries : These are caused by person violently falling on ground or on stationary object. These are found on pas opposite to primary impact or on head. Injuries due to contact with ground include abrasion and bruises over the face, hand, hips and legs, and laceration over the bony prominences. 4) Rolling/Runover (degloving injuries) : Caused by wheel of vehicle or rolling over the victim. Children are oftenly involved."

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Drowning in a fast flowing river o Postmortem lividity does not develop in drowning in running water (due to constantly changing position of body) and areas of contact flattening (due to collapsed capillaries)o Postmortem staining has so many synomyms, i.e. livor mortis/post mortem lividity/hypostasis/cadaveric lividity/ vibices/suggilation/darkening of death.o It refers to discoloration of skin and internal organs after death due to accumulation of fluid blood in toneless capillaries and small veins of dependent part of the body.o As dead body behaves like an inert substance, therefore there is gravitational flow of blood to the dependent parts of body, causing stagnation of blood in toneless capillaries and small veins, causing bluish purple staining of these parts.o Characteristic features of postmortem staining are:1. It does not appear elevated above the surface but has sharply defined (usually horizontal) margins.2. It is an early sign of death. It starts at about 1 hour, becomes a series of mottled patches within 1-3 hours and these pathces increase in size to coalesce in about 3-6 hours. After 6-12 hours, lividity is fully developed and fixed (unchangeable), i.e. primary lividity. It ends when purification sets in. Fixation of lividity is due to stagnation of blood in distended capillaries and venules (not due to coagulation of blood).3. If the position of body is changed, after development of lividity but before it becomes fixed, these patches will disappear and fresh ones will develop in the new dependent areas (secondary lividity), but lividity to a slight degree will remain in the original area due to staining of tissue by hemolysis (complete).4. Normally the staining is at first bluish-pink and afterwards bluish purple. In severe anemia, and death from haemorrhage, the staining is very faint. In deaths from asphyxia, where blood is deoxygenated and may not readily coagulate, the staining is intensely developed and purple in colour. In conditions where blood coagulates quickly eg. in lobar pneumonia lividity is less abvious.5. It is seen on dependent parts of the body, therefore site depends upon position of body after death :i) In supine : On posterior dependent portion of body. But not seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks and back of calves due to contact flattening, i.e. toneless capillaries are compressed and occluded by weight and pressure of body.ii) In hanging: Dependent lower half of both lower limb and upper limb (i.e. lower half of leg with feet and lower half of forearm with hands), and external genitalia.iii) In drowning : Head and upper half of body as head being the heaviest part becomes the dependent part. It does not develop in running water due to constantly changing position of the body.6. No lividity is seen on pressure points of body, i.e. contact pallor, as pressure caused by weight of body causes compression of toneless vessels and prevent their filling with blood :i) In supine : No lividity is seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks, occipital area and calf - contact flattening.ii) Also no lividity occurs in parts tightly tied with belt, waist band or brassiere and the area is seen as stripes or bands called vibices."

It helps the police officer to prevent further commission of offence as a precautionary method. A warrant is a written order issued by a Magistrate to a police officer commanding him to arrest a person. In most serious crimes there may not be sufficient time to obtain a warrant from the Magistrate. By the time police officer obtains warrant the accused may escape. So the necessity to obtain warrant is not required in serious crimes. In Cognizable offences, the person can be arrested without warrant while it is not possible in non-cognizable offences."

    "explanation": "Ans. C: Anaemic hypoxia When carbon monoxide is inhaled, it takes the place of oxygen in hemoglobin Levels of carbon monoxide bound in the blood can be determined by measuring carboxyhemoglobin, which is a stable complex of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin. The affinity between carbon monoxide and hemoglobin is 240 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen. CO binds to hemoglobin, producing carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. This inhibits the transpo, delivery, and utilization of oxygen. This causes hemoglobin to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. Levels of oxygen available for tissue use are decreased. This situation is described as CO shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Blood oxygen content is actually increased in the case of carbon monoxide poisoning; because all the oxygen is in the blood, none is being given to the tissues, and this causes anemic hypoxic. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin (reducing oxygen transpoation), myoglobin (decreasing its oxygen storage capacity), and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (inhibiting cellular respiration). Hallmark pathological change following CO poisoning is bilateral necrosis of the pallidum. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when conveed to carboxyhemoglobin, so a casualty of CO poisoning is described as looking pink-cheeked and healthy. The main medical treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning is breathing 100% oxygen."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Intestine The most common organ affected in underwater blast injury is intestine. Explosion injury An explosion is a phenomenon resulting from sudden release of energy which is then dissipated by a blast wave, by translocation of objects, or by the generation of heat. Injuries in explosion occur due to four factors :? 1) Blast or shock wave When an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the enviornment in which blast occurs :- Air blast (most common) : Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other pas injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected. Under water blast (explosion under water): Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured. Solid blast : Explosive is detonated near a rigid/solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal; fracture of legs and veebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung. 2) Flame or hot gases Burns or burning of body may occur. 3) Flying missiles (debris) Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations. 4) Anoxia Various gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO,."

It is caused when moving head is suddenly decelerated by hitting a firm surface.* Cerebral concussion (stunning) occurs due to head trauma and is characterized by gross physiological disturbance of brain without any anatomical damage. There is sudden loss of consciousness with a tendency to spontaneous recovery.

Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin. Samples to be preserved for chemical analysis * Blood * Routine viscera * Lung * Brain * Hea * Spleen is considered as best specimen due to presence of more RBCs.

Postmoem injuries can cause confusion over the manner and cause of death. Impoant findings in postmoem wounds are: No signs of bleeding. While the person is still alive, the blood is circulating and any injuries such as cuts or stabs will bleed and signs of spuing may be seen on the body or clothes.

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans) b (Hypoxemia) Ref: K.S. Narayan Reddy 21st EdnCommon cause of death in drowning is due to asphyxia. Asphyxia can lead to anoxia, hypoxia.Other causes include vagal inhibition, ventricular fibrillation, laryngeal spasm.A conscious victim will hold his or her breath and will try to access air, often resulting in panic, including rapid body movement. This uses up more oxygen in the blood stream and reduces the time to unconsciousness. The victim can voluntarily hold his or her breath for some time, but the breathing reflex will increase until the victim will try to breathe, even when submerged.The breathing reflex in the human body is weakly related to the amount of oxygen in the blood but strongly related to the amount of carbon dioxide. During apnea, the oxygen in the body is used by the cells, and excreted as carbon dioxide.Thus, the level of oxygen in the blood decreases and the level of carbon dioxide increases. Increasing carbon dioxide levels lead to a stronger and stronger breathing reflex, up to the breath-hold breakpoint, at which the victim can no longer voluntarily hold his or her breath. This typically occurs at an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 55 mm Hg, but may differ significantly from individual to individual and can be increased through training.In fresh water and brackish water drowning the aspirated water is rapidly absorbed from the alveoli into the circulation producing an expansion of blood volume,haemodilution and haemolysis.Circulatory overload, hyponatraemia and sodium/potassium imbalance together with myocardial hypoxia resulted in a dramatic collapse of systolic pressure quickly followed in the majority of cases by ventricular fibrillation.In salt water drowning the aspiration of water results in withdrawal of water from the pulmonary circulation into the alveolar spaces as a result of the osmotic differential while at the same time, electrolytes (sodium, chloride, magnesium) pass into the blood.There is haemo-concentration but not haemolysis and little change in the sodium/potassium balance. In both fresh water and salt water drowning there is terminal pulmonary oedema."

    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Dead body buried in damp, clay soil Adipocere formation (saponification)o Adipocere is a modification ofputrefaction, which occurs in the absence of air. That is when there is excessive moisture (humidity) and warnth (warm temperature), but absence of air i.e. warm humid climate, normal putrefaction does not occur, rather saponification occurs.o Thus adipocese formation occurs in dead bodies which are lying in water (immered in water) or hurried in damp lay soil.o Saponification (adipocer formation) is the conversion of dead body into soft, fatty waxy substance due to conversion of unsaturated liquid fats to saturated solid fats under the influence of intrinsic lipase and lecithinase produced by Cl. perfringens. The process involves gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of body fats into higher fatty acids which combine with calcium and ammonium ions to form insoluble soaps. Ultimately, palmitic, oleic, stearic and hydroxystearic acids are formed, mixture of these is known as adipocere.o Adipocere formation starts in subcutaneous fat and is marked in areas having excessive fat, eg. cheeks, female breast, buttocks and abdomen. Slowly the whole body including muscles and internal viscera change into adipocere. Adipocere has offensive or sweetish smell, however in early stages, smell is ammonical.o Body is converted into soft, waxy and brittle substance, it floats on water, it can be cut easily, it dissolves in alcohol and ethers, and it melts on heating. Facial features and injuries on body are well preserved, thus identfication of body and determination cause of death (in case of injury) are possible.o Normally adipocere formation requires 3 weeks to upto 3 to 6 months. However shortest recorded period in india is 3 days 22 hours. In india, it has been observed to begin within 4-5 days. Adipocere may persist for years or decades. Adipocere does not occur in foetus less than 7 months.o Medicolegal importance : (i) Identification of body (facial features are preserved), (ii) cause of death (injury marks are preserved), (iii) time since death can be estimated."

Technically, joule burn is an endogenous burn, i.e. burns produced due to release of heat from the body, on application of electric current. Electric burns may be of following types :? 1) Contact burns : Due to contact with live wire. 2) Spark burns : Due to sparking of current, e.g. in loose electrical fitting. 3) Flash burns : Caused on being near the main power line, without actual contact. Burns result due to arcing of current from these lines. Characteristic features of electric burns are :? 1) There may be holes in clothes or shoes. 2) There is a wound of entry and wound of exit of electric current :- Entry wound : It is non-bleeding, thick, leathery, greyish white, depressed, hard and cauliflower like, known as crater formation. High voltage current may cause burns over large areas of skin, i.e. crocodile skin lesions. The skin may get coloured due to metallic pigment : green (in brass electrode), black (in iron electrode), blue (in copper electrode) and grey (in aluminium electrode). Exit wound : It is like a laceration and is bleeding. 3) Metals from electrode may melt and as small balls (current pearls) may be carried to tissue. Calcium phosphate of bones may also melt and is radiologically seen as bone pearls (wax dripping). 4) Muscles show Zenker's degeneration. Causes of death Commonest cause of death is ventricular fibrillation. Other causes include shock, cardiopulmonary arrest, cerebral anoxia, paralysis of respiratory muscles, and mechanical injuries due to fall."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "(A) Sodium thiosulphate + Sodium nitrate # Treatment should be started immediately. The principle of the treatment is to reverse the cyanide-cytochrome combination. This is achieved by converting haemoglobin to methaemoglobin by giving nitrites. Break 0.2 c.c ampoule of amyl nitrite in a handkerchief and hold over the patient's nose for 15 to 30 seconds of every minute. 0.3 g. of sodium nitrite in 10 ml. of sterile water is given i.v. slowly, over a period of two to three minutes. Sodium nitrite forms methaemoglobin (Hb-Fe2+), then competeswith cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion, thusprotecting cytochrome oxidase. Do not remove theneedle. Through the same needle infuse 25 g. of sodium thiosulphate in 15% solution, i.v. over a period often minutes. It converts cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in urine.Repeat the nitrite-thiosulphate injection after an hour if recovery has not occurred. Hydroxocobalamine (Vitamin B12) 4 g. i.v. as infusion is given. It detoxifies cyanide by giving a hydroxyl group and then binding a cyanyl group from the cyanide, forming non-toxic cyanocobalamine which is excreted in the urine. It may be used with sodium thiosulphate which reacts with cyanocobalamine in the presence of the enzyme rhodanase, to produce thiocyanate. Dicobal EDTA acts by chelating cyanide to form a harmless product that is excreted in the urine. 600 mg. is given i.v. slowly. It is followed by 300 mg. if recovery does not occur. Cobalt EDTA and aminophenols are more rapid in action, efficacious, and less toxic than nitrites. 4-dimethylaminophenol (4-DMAP) 3 mg/kg. i.v. Gastric lavage is then performed on those who have ingested cyanide using activated charcoal, a mixture of 6% sodium carbonate, 15% ferrous sulphate and 3% citric acid, or 3% hydrogen peroxide, or 5 to 10% sodium thiosulphate, or 1:5000 potassium permanganate, and 200 ml. is left in the stomach. Alternatively stomach wash can be done with a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and ferrous and ferric chloride. Methylene blue is not effective. Ventilate with hundred percent oxygen. Methaemoglobin of more than fifty percent is an indication for exchange transfusion or administration of blood. If death is delayed, a mixture of ferrous and ferric sulphate with potassium carbonate may be given as a chemical antidote to form Prussian blue. Keep the airway clear. Patient should be kept under observation for 24 to 48 hours, as cyanide toxicity may recur. In poisoning by inhalation, remove the patient at once to fresh air and start artificial respiration and oxygen."

These includeSadism : Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on one's partner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc.Lu st murder: In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.Necrophagia : (Neeros =corpse; phagia = to eat) : This is extreme degree of sadism in wrhich the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure.Masochism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, tortured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual partner.Necrophilia : In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants.Fetishism: A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm, eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc.Transvestism = Fonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personal ity is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interest, and associations are ail designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality.Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these parts with several fingers or wdiole hands (it is an offence wrhen done in public).Exhibitionism (Sec 294IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine).Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom : Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman.F rotteurism: Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone.Undinism : In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex.m) Indecent assault (Sec 354IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual part of either or is sexually favored. In such assaults, a man may try to kiss a woman, press or fondle with her breasts, touch or expose the genitalia or thighs, try to put a finger in her vagina, play with vulva.A medical practitioner can be accused of indecent assault if he examines a female patient by stripping her clothes without her consent or even with her consent in the absence of a female attendant.Such assaults are punishable under Sec 354 IPC, upto 2 years imprisonment and/or fine.n) Uranism : General term for perversion of the sexual instinct.o) Satyriasis : Incessant sexual desire.p) Priapism : Painful penile erection in absence of sexual desire."

Not responsible for his act tinder section 84, IPC (Ref: Reddy 33/e p493, 29/e p432)\"Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that involves sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes. It is considered as unsoundness of mind and not of intoxication. Thus if delirium tremens can be proved, the person cannot be held responsible for his offence under section 84 of the lPC.\"\"Section 84 lPC states that: Nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mid, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to the law.''McNaughton's RuleAn accused person is not legally responsible, if it is clearly proved, that at the time of committing the crime, he was suffering from such a defect of reason from abnormality of mid, that he did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or that what he was doing was wrong.Section 84 IPC states that: Nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mid, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to the law.\"The insanity must be directly related to the offence in such a way as to satisfy the court that the mental abnormality had a direct causative relationship to the offence, and that the offence would not have occurred if there was no mental abnormality.It is necessary to show that the intellectual or cognitive faculties of the accused were so disordered, that his reasoning powers as to the facts and actions were not functioning normally.It must be clearly established that a defect of reason resulted from the 'abnormality of the mind'. The abnormality of the mind is any disease which is capable of producing mental dysfunction.However, when mental dysfunction is attributable to external factors (e.g. alcohol and drugs consumed voluntarily), this is not called abnormality of the mind.It is usually assumed to mean one of the major functional or organic psychoses."

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Ans. C: Muscle of the body began to stiffen A few hours after the death, the joints of the body stiffen and become locked in place. This stiffening is called rigor mois. Depending on temperature and other conditions, rigor mois lasts approximately 24- 48 hours in winter and 18-36 hours in summer. The phenomenon is caused by the skeletal muscles paially contracting. The muscles are unable to relax, so the joints become fixed in place Rigor mois can be used to help estimate time of death. The onset of rigor mois may range from 1-2 hours, depending on factors including temperature (rapid cooling of a body can inhibit rigor mois, but it occurs upon thawing). Maximum stiffness is reached around 12-24 hours post moem. It first stas in involuntary muscles (myocardium) Eyelids, neck and jaw muscles are affected first, with the rigor then spreading to other pas of the body. The joints are stiff but after some time general tissue decay and leaking of lysosomal intracellular digestive enzymes will cause the muscles to relax."

Poison causing proximal tubular necrosis : Lead, mercury, arsenic. cadmium, bismuth, phenol (carbolic acid), oxalic acid (oxalate), and ethylene glycol. Angel dust refers to common name for drug phencyclidine. Conium (Hemlock) was used to kill socrates. Oleander (kaner) has two varities :- White (Nerium odorum) : Active principle is nerin consisting of three glycosides : neriodorin, neriodorein, and kerabin. Yellow (cerbera thevetia) : Active principles are three glycosides : Thevetin, thevotoxin and cerberin. Conjunctivae are yellow in picric acid poisoning Corneal ulceration and conjunctival inflammation occurs in copper duct exposure. Conjunctiva and cornea are grey-blue or blue black in chronic silver poisoning. Marqui's test is used in morphine poisoning. A normal GIT rules out poisoning by corrosives (acids and alkalies). Liver necrosis occurs in phosphorus, CC14, chloroform and trinitrotoluene poisonings. Poisons produced due to putrefaction ethyl alcohol and cyanide. Hot-shot : A dose of narcotic with a poison (like strychnine) used to kill a fellow narcotic addict. Neurotic poisons can be subdivided into following categories :? Somniferous poisons : Produce narcotic analgesia by acting on brain, e.g. opium and its deriivatives. Inebriant poisons : Produce generalized CNS depression, e.g. ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, barbiturates, chloral hydrate. Deliriant poisons : Produce delirium as their major symptom e.g. dhatura, balladonna, hyoscyamus, and cannabis indica."

    "explanation": "STRYCHNOS NUX VOMICA Strychnine ( kuchila) is a powerful alkaloid obtained from the seeds of strychnos nux vomica. The seeds contain two principal alkaloids; strychnine and brucine. Mech of Action: It competitively blocks ventral horn motor neurone postganglionic receptor sites in the spinal cord and brainstem and prevents the effects of glycine (the presumed inhibitory transmitter). Widespread inhibition in the spinal cord results in &;release&; excitation. The action is paicularly noted in the anterior horn cells. It stimulates the cerebralcoex. GABA, the neurotransmitter for presynaptic inhibitory neurons is not affected. Signs and Symptoms: When crushed seeds are taken, the symptoms are delayed for an hour or more. If the alkaloid is swallowed, the symptoms occur very rapidly, usually within five to fifteen minutes. Bitter taste in the mouth, sense of uneasiness and restlessness, feeling of suffocation and fear, and difficulty in swallowing occur. The convulsions are preceded by such prodromal symptoms as increased acuity of perception, increased rigidity of muscles, and muscular twitchings. Convulsions are produced due to direct action on the reflex centres of spinal cord, and affect all the muscles at a time. These are at first clonic, but eventually become tonic. During the convulsions, the face is cyanosed and has anxious look, eyes are staring, eyeballs prominent and pupils are dilated. Risus sardonicus results from contraction of the jaws and facial muscles in which the corners of the mouth are drawn back. The mouth is covered with froth, frequently bloodstained. The convulsions are most marked in anti-gravity muscles, so that the body typically arches in hyperextension (opisthotonos). In supine position, the body is suppoed by the heels and head. The legs are adducted and extended, the arms are flexed over the chest or rigidly extended, and the hands are tightly clenched. The head is bent backwards, and the whole of the body becomes rigid, often assuming a bow-like form. Sometimes, the spasm of the abdominal muscles may bend the body forward (emprosthotonos), or to the side (pleorosthotonos). Consciousness is not lost and the mind remains clear till death.

    "explanation": "The Order of Appearance of Rigor All muscles of the body, both voluntary and involuntary are affected. It does not sta in all muscles simultaneously (Nysten&;s rule). It first appears in involuntary muscles; the myocardium becomes rigid in an hour. It begins in the eyelids, neck and lower jaw and passes upwards to the muscles of the face, and downwards to the muscles of the chest, upper limbs, abdomen and lower limbs and lastly in the fingers and toes. In individual limbs, it usually progresses from above downwards. Such a sequence is not constant, symmetrical or regular. In individual limbs, it disappears in the same order in which it has appeared. Shapiro (1950) suggests that rigor mois does not follow the anatomical sequence usually described. He suggests that as rigor mois is a physicochemical process, it is most likely to develop simultaneously in all the muscles, although the changes are more easily first detected in the smaller masses than in the larger. The proximo-distal progression is more apparent than real, for the sequence is determined by the bulk and kind of muscle involved. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-161"

Injury is due to friction. The surface of injury show irregular parallel lines, i.e., furrows or grooves. A violent lateral graze, due to rubbing of skin (as in dragging) is known as brush burn (Gravel rash). Friction burn (Scuff or brush abrasion) occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface or when the skin is covered by clothing. It is an extensive superficial, reddened excoriated area without bleeding and with little or no linear mark. 3) Pressure abrasions (crushing or friction abrasions) : Though it is called friction abrasion, it results from pressure of the object on the body with no or little friction (it is a misnomer). It is caused by crushing of superficial epidermis due to inward directed movement of object at around 90deg to skin. Example are ligature marks in hanging/strangulation, teeth bites and nail marks. 4) Impact abrasion (Imprint or contact abrasion) : It is caused by impact (but not pressure) with a rough object, when the force is applied at or near 90deg to skin surface. It is depressed below surface unless associated with contusion (bruise)."

The methods used areGustafson's method ; Useful only in persons older than 21 years of age, depending on the physiological changes in each of the dental tissues.Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel).Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent part of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis).Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, start from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis.Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde).Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root start at apex and extend upward (may be pathological).Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria).Mile's method : Age can be knowm by changes of root transparency.C) Boyde' method : On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at birth (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination.D) Stack's method : Age of i nfant can be knowrn from height and weight of erupting teeth,"

    "explanation": "Ref:Synopsis of Forensic medicine and toxicology (K.S.Narayan Reddy) 28th edition, page no.239 Ploucquet&;s Test:The blood flow in the lung beds is so increased after breathing that their weight is almost doubled, from 1/70 of the body weight before respiration to 1/35 after respiration. The increase in weight is not constant and is not a reliable indication of breathing. Fodere&;s test: The lung are ligated across their hila and separated. THe average weight of the both lungs before respiration varies from 30g to 40g, and after respiration from 60g to 66g. The increase in weight is due to the increased flow of blood. Raygat's test/hydrostatic test:The hydrostatic test is based on the principle that if the infant has breathed, the lung will float in water. each lung is cut into pieces and tested for floataion in water. A piece of liver is used as control. if the liver bit floats, the test has no meaning, it is clear that putrefaction has set in. If all the pieces of lung float, they are crushed under a weight and tested again. flaotion is positive when the baby has respired. But if the piece sink after pressure, no respiration has taken place. if some piece float while otherb sink, it mean feeble respiration taken place. Wredin&;s test: Before bih, the middle ear contain gelatinous embryonic connective tissue. with respiration the spincter at the pharyngesl end of eustachian tube relaxes and air replaces the gelatinous substance in few hours to five weeks."

Injuries in explosion occur due to four factorsBlast or shock waveWhen an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the enviomment in which blast occursAir blast (most common) : Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other parts injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected.Under water blast (explosion under water) : Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured.Solid blast: Explosive is detonated near a rigid-'solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal. fracture of legs and vertebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung.Flame or hot gasesBums or burning of body may occur.Flying missiles (debris)Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations.AnoxiaVarious gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO2"

Both ends tied with rope which causes death of the victim.# GAROTTING: Victim is attacked from behind with a rope over the neck.# MUGGING: strangulation caused by holding the neck of the victim in the bend of the elbow.* SUFFOCATION is a form of asphyxia, which is caused by deprivation of oxygen, either due to lack of oxygen in environment or from obstruction of air passages at the level of nose and mouth.* Forms of suffocation asphyxia:# BURKING is a method of homicidal smothering and traumatic asphyxia.# Smothering: form of asphyxia caused by closing the external respiratory orifices either by hand or other means# Gagging: asphyxia by forcing cloth into the mouth.# Overlaying: asphyxia due to compression of chest. Ex: Mother overlied on infant.# Choking: asphyxia by obstruction of air passages, usually between the pharynx and bifurcation of trachea. Almost always accidental.# Cafe coronary: Alcoholic who is grossly intoxicated dies while having meal. Death occurs due to sudden heart attack.

There is weakness of legs and face. Muscle paralysis occurs in following order :- mouth (first) followed by throat and finally respiratory muscles. Cobra venom also produces convulsions (krait venom produces only paralysis). B. Vasculotoxic (hematotoxic) It includes vipers. Viper venom contains hemolysins and thromboplasin which cause widspread endothelial damage and hemolysis. Locally at the site of bite, there is severe oozing of blood. There may be coagulation abnormalities with death due to hemorrhagic shock. Hematuria and hemoglobinuria occurs due to hemolysis. C. Myotoxic (musculotoxic) These are sea snakes. Their venom produces generalized muscle pain, weakness, followed by polymyositis,myoglobinuria, hyperkalemia and increased muscle enzymes. Finally there is respiratory and renal failure."

    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "MERCURY (QUICKSILVER) Chronic Poisoning (Hydrargyrism):- This may result from (1) continuous accidental absorption (2) excessive therapeutic use, (3) fromrecovery from a large dose, and ( 4) if ointment is used as external application for a long time. Chronic exposure leads to classic triad of gingivitis and salivation, tremors and neuropsychiatric changes. The symptoms are salivation, inflammation of gums and occasionally a blue line at their junction with teeth, sore mouth and throat, loosening of teeth , gastrointestinal disturbances, anaemia, anorexia, loss of weight and chronic inflammation of kidneys with progressive uraemia. Tremors (sometimes called Danbury tremors):- occur first in the hands, then progress to lips and tongue and finally involve arms and leg. The advanced condition is called hatter&;s shakes or* glass-blower&;s shakes, because they are common in persons working in glass-blowing and hat industries. The patient then becomes unable to dress himself. write legibly or walk Properly. The most severe form is known as concussio mercurialis, in which no activity is possible. Mercurial erethism:- is seen in persons working with mercury in minor manufacturing firms. This term is used to refer to the psychological effects of mercury toxicity. These include anxiety, depression, shyness, timidity, irritability, loss of confidence, mental depression, delusions and hallucinations, or suicidal melancholia, or manic depressive psychosis (mad hatter), emotional instability, loss of memory and insomnia. Mercurialentis:- is a peculiar eye change due to exposure to the vapour of mercury. It is due to brownish deposit of mercury through the cornea on the anterior lens capsule. Slit-lamp examination demonstrates a malt-brown reflex from the anterior lens capsule. It is bilateral and has no effect on visual acuity. Renal damage results in membranous glomerulonephritis with hyaline casts and fatty casts in the urine. Kidney is the primary target. Acrodynia or pink disease :- (because it is characterised by a generalised body rash) is thought to be an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction paicularly seen in children. This can be caused by Chronic mercury exposure in any form. The onset is insidious with anorexia, insomnia, sweating, skin Rash and photophobia. Hands and feet become puffy, Pinkish, painful, paraesthetic with peeling of skin. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-542,543"

Heat syncope caused by cutaneous and muscular vasodilation redistributes intravascular volume to the periphery of the body. The patient's skin is cool and moist, the pulse is weak, and transient hypotension occurs. Heat exhaustion results from prolonged strenuous activity with inadequate water or salt intake in a hot environment. Heat exhaustion may progress to heat stroke if sweating ceases and mental status declines. Ref: Nemer J.A. (2013). Chapter 37. Disorders Related to Environmental Factors. In M.A. Papadakis, S.J.

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Blood group Blood and blood stains The examination of blood and blood stains is an impoant pa of crime detection. The points that are usually required to be determined regarding stains are : (1) nature of stain (whether the stains is blood or not); (2) the species (human or animal) from which the blood has come from; and (3) blood group. Nature of stain (whether the stain is blood or not) To determine the nature of stain, following tests are used : 1. Chemical tests These tests are based on the peroxidase activity of haematin, which is, derived from oxidation of haem of haemoglobin or methemoglobin, present. This enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide conves colourless salts into coloured bases. Thus these tests are based on H202 and peroxidase enzyme. Tests are : Benzidine test: Greenish blue colour. Phenolphthalein test (kastle myere test) : Deep permanganate colour. Leucomalachite green test : Bluish green or peacock blue colour. Guaiacum test : Blue colour. Ohotoludine test (kohn test) : Blue or green colour. Amidopyrine test : Purple colour. 2. Microchemical tests These tests are based on propey of haem pa of hemoglobin to form characteristic coloured crystals. The tests are : Teichmann's haemin crystal test. Takayama hemochromogen crystal test. Luminal spray test : It is especially useful in old obscure blood stains. Spetroscopy It is most delicate and reliable test. It is based on the principle that hemoglobin and its derivatives give characteristic absorption bands when viewed through a spectroscope. 4. Microscopy Microscopic examination of RBCs is possible only in fresh stains. Detection of species (whether the blood has come from human or animal) For detection of species, serological (immunological) tests are used. These tests are : Precipitin test Haemaglutination inhibition test (antiglobulin consumption test or absorption inhibition test). Gel diffusion test. Double diffusion test. Precipitation electrophoresis. Latex agglutination test. Isoenzyme method (enzymological test). Detection of blood group of blood stain These tests are : Immunological (serological) : (i) aborption-elution test, (ii) absorption-inhibition test, (iii) mixed agglutination test, (iv) latex test. Enzymological methods. Latte's crust method."

Arsenic poisoning may be acute or chronic. Acute arsenic poisoning It can present in any of the two ways : Gastrointestinal type : It is the common form and resembles bacterial gastroenteritis (e.g. cholera). There is garlic adour with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and necrosis of intestinal mucosa. There is tenesmus and anal irritation. Dehydration may cause acute circulatory collapse, with hypotension, oliguria and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Fulminant narcotic form : Large dose of arsenic is rapidly absorbed without producing GI symptoms. These are giddiness, headache, myalgia, formication, veigo and death in 2-3 hours. Postmoem appearance include : Red velvety mucosa of stomach and submucous petechial haemorrhage. Subendocardial petechial haemorrhage. Fatty degeneration of liver, kidney and hea. Chronic arsenic poisoning Chronic arsenic poisoning has four stages : First stage (nutritional and gastrointestinal disturbances) : The earliest sign is gradual emaciation. There is loss of appetite, nausea and intermittent vomiting and diarrhea. Second stage (catarrhal changes) : It resembles common cold, i.e. conjunctivitis, running nose and eyes, coughing etc. Third stage (skin rash) : There is classical 'rain drop pigmentation', i.e. patchy brown pigmentation of skin. At initial stages, there is a vesicular eruption which may resemble nettle rash. Hyperkeratosis of palms and soles occur. There are white transverse bands crossing the nails, known as Mee's line, and indicate periods of arrested growth due to interference with normal metabolism. There is alopecia and exfoliative dermatitis. Fouh stage (nervous disturbances) : There is sensory and motor (i.e. mixed) polyneuropathy, with painful paresthesia of hands and feet and muscle tenderness. There may be evidence of liver (fatty liver) and kidney damage and bone marrow suppression (causing anemia and other cytopenias). Hea may also be involved. Chronic arsenic exposure can also cause 'black foot disease' a severe form of peripheral vascular disease, causing gangrene of lower limbs. Arsenic is carcinogenic, can cause cancers of skin (squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma), lung, liver, bladder, kidney, larynx and lymphoid system (leukemia)."

That's why, it is best (most sensitive and most specific) and most reliable method of identification (Quetelet's rule of biological variation). DNA finger printing may be same in monozygotic twins,o The pattern is neither inherited nor identical in any two persons. So the paternity cannot be proved through finger print patterns. However, paternity can be proved by DNA finger printing.o Loops (67% most common) > whorls (25%) > arches (7%) > composite (2% least common) are four main types of pattern.o It is accepted that chances of 2 finger prints matching 16 ridge characteristic are infinitely small (Parikh's). In practice 8-16 (Reddy) / 16-20 (Seth, Simpson) points offine comparison are accepted as proof of identity.o Locard's poroscopy method is study of microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweat gland present on ridges of fingers. These pores are permanent, remain un changed during life and are very useful when only fragments of fingerprints are available. Each milimeter contains 9-18 pores,o Criminals may attempt to multilate finger prints by applying CO2 snow, corrosive agents, burns or eroding against hard surface. But these manners do not destroy finger prints permanently unless true skin is completely destroyed."

DNA is present in white blood cells of humans, but not red blood cells which lack nuclei. A dime-sized spot of blood, approximately 50 pi in volume, is enough DNA for a typical VNTR analysis.DNA from sperm heads is usually the most important source of DNA evidence for sexual assault cases. Five pi of semen contains approximately the same amount of DNA as 50 pi ofblood. Special extraction methods are required to release DNA from sperm heads.Saliva contains cellular material. DNA can be extracted from bite marks, cigarette butts, postage stamps on envelopes, and envelope flaps for DNA analysis. In fact, the \"Unabomber\" was convicted partially on DNA evidence from a letter-bomb he mailed that did not explode.The hair follicle at the base of human hairs contains cellular material rich in DNA. In order to be used for DNA analysis, the hair must have been pulled from the body -- hairs that have been broken off do not contain DNA.Any body tissue that has not been degraded is a potential source of DNA.Bone is one of the best sources of DNA from decomposed human remains.Like bones, teeth can also be an excellent source of DNA, long after the rest of the body has decomposed.Urine itself does not contain DNA, but it may contain epithelial cells, which do contain DNA. Most healthy individuals, however, do not excrete epithelial cells in their urine."

Lead poisoning may be acute or chronic.oOne manifestation of chronic lead toxicity is the rheumatologic entity known as saturnine gout.oIllicitly distilled beverages may inadvertently contain harmful toxins, like metallic lead.oLead has been known to play a role in purine metabolism & renal insufficiency.CARDINAL SYMPTOMS OF LEAD INTOXICATIONAcuteChronic*. GI effects-. colic, severe pain-. severe constipation*. Peripheral, central neuropathy*. Cardiac toxicity*. Acute encephalopathy*. Chronic nephropathy*. Acute nephropathy*. Saturnine gout*. In Children*. Reproductive effects*. Growth retardation*. Hypertension?*. Behavioural problems* Anemia[?]Chronic Lead Poisoning or Plumbism or Saturnism:oChronic lead poisoning results from a daily intake of one to two mg. of lead; Lead vapour is more dangerous than dust & it is a typical cumulative poison.[?]Signs and Symptoms of Chronic Lead Poisoning:oFacial Pallor: mouth is one of the earliest and most consistent sign due to vasospasm.oAnaemia: There may be polycythaemia with polychromatophilia in early stages, but later there is anaemia which is associated with polychromasia, punctate basophilia, reticulocytosis, poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, nucleated red cells (sideroblasts) and an increase in mononuclear cells, whereas polymorphonuclear cells and platelets are decreased.-Anaemia is probably due to decreased survival time of red blood cells and inhibition of haeme synthesis by interference with the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin.-Punctate basophilia or basophilic stippling means the presence of many dark blue-coloured pinhead sized spots in the cytoplasm of red blood cells, due to toxic action of lead on porphyrin metabolism.-Reticulocytes and basophilic stippled cells result from the inhibition of 5 pyrimidine nucleotidase, an impaired ability to rid the cell of RNA degradation products and the aggregation of ribosome.-Eosinophilia is more common than basophilic stippling. Porphyrins excreted in urine may be 500 micrograms per day.oLead Line: A stippled blue line, called Burtonian line, is seen on the gums in 50 to 70% of cases. It appears due to subepithelial deposit of granules at the junction with teeth, only near dirty or carious teeth, within a week of exposure, especially on upper jaw. It is due to formation of lead sulphide by the action of hydrogen sulphide formed by decomposed food in the mouth.-A similar blue line may be seen in cases of poisoning by mercury, copper, bismuth, iron and silver.oColic and Constipation: It is usually later symptom. Colic of intestines, ureters, uterus and blood vessels occur in 85% of cases. The colic occurs at night and the pain may be very severe.-Individual attacks last only a few minutes, but may recur for several days or weeks. Constipation is usual but diarrhoea or vomiting may occur.oLead Palsy: It usually occurs late, and is seen in less than 10% of cases.-There may be tremors, numbness, hyperaesthesia, and cramps before the actual muscle weakness. It is commoner in adults than in children, and men are particularly affected.-Muscle groups affected are those most prone to fatigue. Usually the extensor muscles of the wrist (wrist drop; radial nerve is affected), are affected, but the deltoid, biceps, anterior tibial (foot drop), and rarely muscles of eye or intrinsic muscles of hand or foot are affected.-Paralysis is associated with degeneration of the nerve and atrophy of the muscles.-Recovery may be complete but is usually slow.oEncephalopathy: Lead encephalopathy, in some form is said to be present in almost every case of plumbism. It is common in children often associated with tetraethyl lead.-Symptoms are vomiting, headache, insomnia, visual disturbances, irritability, restlessness, delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, coma and death. Lead encephalopathy is usually irreversible and about 85% have permanent brain damage.-Death occurs in about 25% cases.oCardiovascular System and Kidneys: Lead causes vascular constriction, leading to hypertension and permanent arteriolar degeneration. Chronic arteriosclerotic nephritis and interstitial nephritis occur.oReproductive System: Menstrual derangements, such as amenorrhoea, dysmenonhoea, I menorrhagia, sterility of both sexes, and abortion are, frequent. Abortion occurs in pregnant women between 3 to 6 months.oOther Systems: They are dyspepsia, anorexia, emaciation, general weakness, exhaustion, irritability, foul breath, headache, vertigo, loss of hair and drowsiness. Peripheral neuritis is rare. Retinal stippling is noticed by ophthalmoscopic examination showing presence of greyish glistening lead particles in the early phase of poisoning."

Another hypothesis is that prolonged exposure to severe cold may produce paralysis of the thermal regulatory mechanism. This causes failure of vasoconstriction of aerioles of the skin ,which causes increased blood flow to the skin causing an abnormal sensation of warmth.

That's why, it is best (most sensitive and most specific) and most reliable method of identification (Quetelet'srule of biological variation). DNA fingerprinting may be same in monozygotic twins,o The pattern is neither inherited nor identical in any two persons. So the paternity cannot be proved through finger print patterns. However, paternity can be proved by DNA finger printing.o Loops (67% most common) > whorls (25%) > arches (7%) > composite (2% least common) are four main types of pattern.o It is accepted that chances of 2 finger prints matching 16 ridge characteristic are infinitely small (Parikh's). In practice 8-16 (Reddy) /16 - 20 (Seth, Simpson) points offine comparision are accepted as proof of identity.o Locard's poroscopy method is study of microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweat gland present on ridges of fingers. These pores are permanent, remain un changed during life and are very useful when only fragments offingerprints are available. Each milimeter contains 9-18 pores,o Criminals may attempt to multilate finger prints by applying CO, snow, corrosive agents, burns or eroding against hard surface. But these manners do not destroy finger prints permanently unless true skin is completely destroyed."

Sweat glands -- increased sweating. 4. Salivary glands -- increased salivation. 5. Lacrimal glands -- increased lacrimation. 6. Eyes -- miosis, blurring of vision or dimness of vision. Miosis develops due to the inhibition of cholinesterase and marked parasympathomimetic stimulation of iris. However, dilatation of pupil in organophosphate intoxication have been recorded, therefore, it is essential not to rely only on pupillary size as diagnostic criteria for organophosphate compound poisoning. 7. Hea -- slow pulse, hypotension. 8. Urinary bladder -- frequency of micturation, urinary incontinence. {Muscarinic manifestation can be remembered with the mnemonic \"DUMBELS\" D = diarrhea, U = urination, M = miosis, B = Bronchospasm, bradycardia, E = emesis (vomiting), L = lacrimation, S = salivation} B. Nicotinic effects The nicotinic effects are as follows: 1. Striated muscles -- easy fatigue, weakness, muscular twitching, fasciculation, cramps 2. Sympathetic ganglia -- pallor, occasional elevation of blood pressure (hypeension), tachycardia 3. Increased adrenal medulla activity (Nicotinic manifestation can be remembered with the mnemonic \"MATCH\" M = muscle weakness and fasciculation, A = adrenal medulla activity increase, T = tachycardia, C = cramps in muscle, H = hypeension). C. CNS effects The CNS effects are: 1. Irritability 2. Apprehension 3. Restlessness 4. Fine fibrillary tremors of hands, eyelids, face or tongue 5. Muscular weakness 6. Convulsions -- the convulsions may be tonic (limbs stretched and rigid) or may be clonic (rapid repetitive movement). Clonic convulsions are more common. 7. Mental confusion progressing to stupor to coma 8. Depression of respiratory and circulatory centers REF;THE SYNOPSIS OF FORENSIC MEDICINE:KS NARAYANA REDDY;28th EDITION;PAGE NO 292"

Depending upon the method used to constrict the neck, strangulation can be divided into : Ligature strangulation : Neck is compressed by a ligature of which usually multiple rounds are given and no knot is tied. Throttling (manual strangulation) : Neck is compressed by one or both hands. When neck is compressed by two palms, it is known as palmar strangulation. Bansdola : Compression of neck with one or two wooden sticks or bamboo. Garrotting : It is compression of neck by a rope thrown from behind. Spanish windlass is a type of garrotting, which used to be the official mode of execution in spain. In this, an iron collor around the neck was tightened by a screw for strangulation. Mugging (choke hold) : It is compression of neck by forearm or in the bend of elbow. Strangulation by knee/foot : In this, neck is compressed by knee or foot."

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Fact speaks for itself o It means \"the thing or fact speaks for itself\".o In a case of professional negligence of a physician, the patient need not prove negligence.Doctrines related with negligence1) Resp Ipsa Loquitar (fact speaks for itself):# Generally the innocence of doctor is assumed and patient has to establish the guilt# However, it is not required to prove negligence in case where doctrine of resp ipsa loquitar applies; rather the doctor has to defend himself.2) Calculated risk doctrine:# It is a defence to doctor. It states that 'resp ipsa loquitar should not be applied when the complained injury may have occured even through proper care has been taken.3) Doctrine of common knowledge:# Is a varient of res ipsa loquitar in which patient has to prove the negligence but he need not produce evidence to establish the standard of care (in res ipsa loquitar both are not required).# It is based on assumption that the doctor will be held responsible for negligence in particular case which are within the common knowledge of medical practioner e.g. not giving fluids in dehydrated or ATS in injuries.4) Diagnostic or Therapeutic misadvanture:# It is the occurance of misadvanture causing injury or death of the patient due to inherent risk of procedure or drug, e.g. adverse effects of a drug. It is unintetional.5) Medical maloccurance (inevitable accident or Act of god):# On certain occasions, despite all proper care given by doctor during treatment, the patient may fails to respond properly or may suffer adverse reactions of drug. It is due to biological variations in different people.6) Novus Actus Interveniens :# A person is responsible for his actions and its consequences. This principle applies to cases of assault or accidental injuries. However, sometime such continuty of events is broken by an entirely new and unexpected happening, due to negligence of some other person, i.e. \"novus actus intervenien\" (an unrelated action intervening).# For example, If a person has been assaulted due to which he has sustained large liver laceration, for which he is operated by a surgeon. If the patient dies intraoperatively or postopratively due to complications related to surgery or injury, the person who has assaulted the patient will be held responsible. But, if the doctor has done some negligent act during surgery, e.g. left the swab or instrument in abdomen during surgery; and patient dies because of that act (sepsis due to swab), then the resposibility may pass from original incident to later negligent act of doctor by principle of 4novus actus intervention' (an unrelated action intervening). Thus doctor is responsible for negligent act, i.e. criminal negligence, and the assailant will not be fully responsible for the ultimate harm.7) Contributory negligence:# It is defined as concurrent or simultaneous negligence of doctor and patient so as to lead to damage to the patient.# Normally it is only a partial defence and court has right to fix liabilities between doctor and patient (doctrine of comparative negligence) and damages awarded may be reduced accordingly.# Contributory negligence can be used as defence by the doctor, but in civil cases only. It cannot be used as defence in followingi) Criminal negligenceii) Last clear chance doctrine; i.e. if doctor has discovered it before causing injury and failed to avoid that.iii) Avoidable consequences rule; i.e. due to negligence of doctor, there occurs damage to patient, but due to later damage of patient, damage becomes more.Good samartion doctrine: One who assisted another in serious need cannot be charged for contributory negligence, provided that the assistance is not rash and reckless.8) Vicarious responsibility (Liability):# It means master is liable for negligent acts of his servants, even inspite of absence of blame-worthy conduct on his part.# Thus hospital and senior medical staff are responsible for negligent act of junior medical staff (interns and resident doctors). This responsibility is there because of master servant relationship, i.e. the senior can dictate the line of treatment to be followed. However, hospital is not responsible for senior medical staff as master servent relationship does not exist.# The vicarious responsibility is there only in civil negligence cases and not in criminal cases.9) Borrowed servant doctrine (captain of the ship doctrine):# The private practitioner, who is not a staff of a private hospital, will be held responsible for all the negligent acts by any of the hospital staff on the patient admitted by him.# The hospital will not be held here liable, because all the instructions for the patient admitted is carried on by hospital staff as told by private practitioner (i.e. he is the captain of the ship).10) Product liability:# Manufacturer is liable for quality of drug and medical equipment."

      "Alcohol",

    "explanation": "Ans. B: Arsenic In chronic arsenic poisoning, a classical state of ill health results are represented by 4 stages. First stage of nutritional and gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhoea is common) Third stage (of skin rashes) shows white bands known as Mees line crossing the nail of fingers and toes In addition to this, there may be evidence of liver damage, kidney damage and bone marrow depression at some stage Arsenic poisoning Increased levels of the element arsenic in the body. Arsenic interferes with cellular longevity by allosteric inhibition of an essential metabolic enzyme. Symptoms of arsenic poisoning include headache, confusion, convulsion, diarrhea, vomiting, and in severe case coma and death Routes of exposure include contaminated water, air, and food. Occupational exposure to arsenic may occur with copper or lead smelting and wood treatment and among workers involved in the production or application of pesticides Symptoms of arsenic poisoning begin with headaches, confusion, severe diarrhea, and drowsiness. As the poisoning develops, convulsions and changes in fingernail pigmentation called leukonychia may occur. When the poisoning becomes acute, symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, blood in the urine, cramping muscles, hair loss, stomach pain, and more convulsions. The organs of the body that are usually affected by arsenic poisoning are the lungs, skin, kidneys, and liver. Chronic arsenic exposure can remain in the body systems for a longer period of time than a shoer term or more isolated exposure and can be detected in a longer time frame after the introduction of the arsenic, impoant in trying to determine the source of the exposure. Hair is a potential bioindicator for arsenic exposure due to its ability to store trace elements from blood. Incorporated elements maintain their position during growth of hair. Thus for a temporal estimation of exposure, an assay of hair composition needs to be carried out with a single hair which is not possible with older techniques requiring homogenization and dissolution of several strands of hair. This type of biomonitoring has been achieved with newer microanalytical techniques like Synchroton radiation based X ray fluorescence (SXRF) spectroscopy and Micropaicle induced X ray emission (PIXE). Dimercaprol and dimercaptosuccinic acid are chelating agents which sequester the arsenic away from blood proteins and are used in treating acute arsenic poisoning. The most impoant side effect is hypeension. Dimercaprol is considerably more toxic than succimer"

    "explanation": "DECOMPOSITION It involves two processes: (1) Autolysis and (2) Putrefaction. Autolysis: Autolysis is self-digestion of tissues Putrefaction: The disintegration of body tissues after death is known as decomposition. The terms decomposition and putrefaction are used as synonyms. Putrefaction usually follows the disappearance of rigor mois. During hot season, it may commence before rigor mois has completely disappeared from the lower extremities. Mechanism: Organisms enter the tissues sholy after death, mainly from the alimentary canal, and less often through the respiratory tract or through an external skin wound. Multiplication of bacteria begins within 4 hours and peak is reached within 24-30 hours. The fall in the oxygen concentration in the tissues and rise in hydrogen ion concentration after death our bacterial growth and spread throughout the body. Because the protective agencies of the body are absent, the bacteria spread through the blood vessels using the proteins and carbohydrates of the blood as culture media. The chief destructive bacterial agent is Cl. welchii, which causes marked haemolysis, liquefaction of postmoem clots and of fresh thrombi and emboli, disintegration of tissue and gas formation in blood vessels and tissue spaces. Bacteria produce a large variety of enzymes and these breakdown the various tissues of the body. Lecithinase produced by Cl. welchii is most impoant. This hydrolyses the lecithin which is present in all cell membranes including blood cells*, and is responsible for the postmoem haemolysis of blood. Features: The characteristic features of putrefaction are: (1) changes in the colour of the tissues, (2) the evolution of gases in the tissues, and (3) the liquefaction of tissues. The first external sign of putrefaction in a body lying in air is usually a greenish discolouration of the skin over the region of the caecum, which lies fairly superficially, and where the contents of the bowel are more fluid and full of bacteria. Internally, this is seen on the undersurface of the liver, anterior peritoneal surface of right lobe of liver and adipose tissue around gallbladder, where that organ is in contact with the hepatic flexure and transverse colon. The colour results from the conversion of haemoglobin of blood into sulphmethaemoglobin by the hydrogen sulphide formed in the large intestine and escaping into the surrounding tissues. The colour appears in 12 to 18 hours in summer and in one to two days in winter. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-164,165"

Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1991 Mar: 164(3): 797- 800. & http://www2. marshfieldclinic.org/wissp/commonly.htmExplanation:* It is generally impossible to collect blood or to culture tissue from a macerated stillborn fetus. Accurate genotyping of such a fetus may. however, be critical for the diagnosis of genetic diseases and appropriate genetic counselling.It is particularly important to sample fetal placenta under those circumstances since these cells tend to survive longer after fetal death.Placental tissue is an ideal sampling site in a macerated fetus.Maceration:It is a process of aseptic autolysis.This occurs when the dead fetus remains in utero for about 3-4 days surrounded by amniotic fluid without air.Signs of maceration are not seen if child is born within 24 hours after death.If air enters the amniotic fluid after the death of fetus, putrefaction occurs instead of maceration.The earliest sign of maceration - Skin slippage (Seen after 12 hours of death of child).Spalding's Sign:Loss of alignment and overriding of the bones of the cranial vault occurs due to shrinkage of the cerebrum after death of the fetus.In early stage, there is only loss of alignment without overriding.This sign develops earlier with vertex presentation."

Manufacture of plastic Absorption, Metabolism and Excretion * Phenol is absorbed from skin, gastric mucosa, per rectum, per vagina and respiratory tract * Phenol is conveed into hydroquinone and pyrocatechol and excreted in urine. Traces are excreted by lungs, salivary glands, and skin. Fatal dose: * 2 gm crystals * 25 to 50 ml of household phenol Fatal period: 3 to 4 hours. Mechanism of Action * Phenol has local as well as systemic action * Locally it acts as corrosive agent and when absorbed, it causes CNS depression, metabolic acidosis and renal failure. * Carbolic acid has great penetrating power and it coagulates protein. * Phenols have a powerful antipyretic effect similar to that of salicylates. * Phenols and derivatives of phenols cause methemoglobinemia Clinical Features Local: When applied to skin or mucosa, it causes burning pain, numbness, tingling and anesthesia. It causes corrosion and produce white eschar (scar), which falls off in few days leaving brown stained area. Systemic: 1. GIT: Burning pain followed by tingling numbness and anesthesia. Nausea and vomiting. 2. RS: Respiration is slow and labored. 3. CNS: Headache, giddiness, unconsciousness, convulsions, coma. 4. Oliguria and hepatic failure. 5. Urine: May be colorless but on exposure to air turns green due to oxidation of phenol metabolites (hydroquinone and pyrocatechol). It is known as carboluria. 6. The hydroquinone and pyrocatechol may cause pigmentation in the cornea and various cailages, a condition known as oochronosis. Management * Skin: Wash with undiluted polyethylene glycol. * Oxygen/ventilatory suppo * Intravenous fluids and vasopressors to suppo blood pressure * Ingestion: Cautious stomach wash with sodium or magnesium sulfate solution * Lidocaine for ventricular arrhythmias * Benzodiazepines for seizures * Treat methemoglobinemia - if methemoglobinemia is > 30%, ingest Methylene blue (1-2 mg/kg).

The convulsions last for 30 seconds to 2 minute and are precipitated by slightest stimuli such as sudden noise, a current of air or gentle touching of patient. The convulsions are first clonic but eventually becomes tonic. In between the convulsions, the muscles are completely relaxed and it is an impoant diagnostic feature. * The convulsions are more marked in anti-gravity muscles and body arches in hyperextension position and lies on heel and head. This position of body is known as opisthotonos. It is most common position. However, at time, the body may bend forward and the condition is called as emprosthotonos. If body bends side wise (i.e. lateral bending), the condition is called as pleurothotonos. * Contraction of the muscles of face causes widening of the angle of mouth with creases appearing around eyelids. This condition is known as risus sardonicus. Also called as sardonic smile due to grimacing that occurred due to muscle contraction of face. * There is difficulty in breathing during convulsions due to contraction of chest muscles and diaphragm. * Patient remains conscious and maintains clear sensorium during and between convulsions. * There may be frothing at mouth and pupils are dilated * Prognosis is good if interval for appearance of convulsions increases and period of convulsion decreases.

He evaluated the correlation of six physiological changes with increasing age. These are :Attrition - d/t wear & tear from mastication, occlusal (upper) surface of the teeth is destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel, then dentin and at last the pulp.Paradentosis - with advancing age the gums and peridental tissue surrounding the teeth show regression, gradually exposing the necks, and adjacent part of root of teeth.The amount of secondary dentin - Secondary dentil deposition occurs within the pulp cavity and gradually decreases the size of the cavity.Cementum apposition - Secondary cementum is slowly and continuously deposited throughout life forming incremental lines.Age can be estimated by counting these incremental lines.The degree of root resorption Transparency of root dentine - It is the most reliable of all criteria. It is not seen before 30 yrs of age."

Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin. Samples to be preserved for chemical analysis * Blood * Routine viscera * Lung * Brain * Hea * Spleen is considered as best specimen due to presence of more RBCs.

Shellfish such as mussels, scallops, and oysters may be a major source of dietary cadmium, and may contain 100 to 1,000 mcg/kg. Cadmium's toxic effects may be due to the displacement or substitution of cadmium for zinc in critical metabolic processes. Cadmium interferes with the uptake, distribution and action of zinc. The kidney accumulates cadmium over a lifetime. Renal damage occur once the cadmium concentration exceeds about 200 micrograms per gram of kidney weight. Nausea, metallic taste, salivation, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and myalgia.

Since incest involves sexual intercourse, it is not considered as a sexual perversion.Uranism - It is a general term for sexual perversion. Different types of sexual perversions are given below.Sadism - Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain upon one's partnerMasochism - They get sexual pleasure from being beaten, abused or tortured by their sexual partnerLust murder - It is an extreme form of sadism where murder serves as a stimulus for sexual act.Necrophagia -This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds or eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure.Necrophilia - There is desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies.Fetichism - In this the person gets sexual gratification from part of the body of a woman or some article belonging to her that normally has no sexual influence on the mind. Eg -Underclothings, shoes etc.Transvestism or Eonism - It is usually found in males who obtain sexual pleasure by wearing female dressFellatio - Oral stimulation or manipulation of the penis, either by the male or female.Cunnilingus - Oral stimulation of female genitalia"

Simultaneous contraction of opposing flexor and extensor muscles causes severe muscle injury, with rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and, in some cases, acute renal failure. Ref: Nordt S.P. (2012).

Forensic investigators use luminol to detect trace amounts of blood at crime scenes, as it reacts with the iron in haemoglobin. Biologists use it in cellular assays to detectcopper, iron, and cyanides, as well as specific proteins by western blot. When luminol is sprayed evenly across an area, trace amounts of an activating oxidant make the luminol emit a blue glow that can be seen in a darkened room. The glow only lasts about 30 seconds, but investigators can document the effect with a long-exposure photograph. Crime scene investigators must apply it evenly to avoid misleading results, as blood traces appear more concentrated in areas that receive more spray. The intensity of the glow does not indicate the amount of blood or other activator present, but only shows the distribution of trace amounts in the area."

It is accepted in india as law of criminal responsibility and is embodied in section 84 IPC as - \"nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind is incapable of knowing the nature of act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law\". 2.Doctrine of paial responsibility - If a person is suffering from some weakness or aberration of mind (though not completely insane), he is only paially responsible for his actions, e.g. obsession states or depressions. 3. Durhan rule- Accused is not responsible for the act, if his act resulted from mental disease or defect. 4. Currens rule- A person is not responsible if at the time of committing the crime, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct according to the requirements of law, as a result of his mental disease or defect. 5.American law institute test-Insane lacks the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to confirm to the requirements of law, therefore he is not responsible for crimes committed. 6.Norwegion system-No defendant considered insane or unconscious at the time of offence, may be punished."

Gutter fractures are formed when pa of the thickness of the bone is removed so to form a gutter, e.g., in oblique bullet wounds. Ring or foramen fractures are fractures which encircle the skull in such a manner that the anterior third is separated at its junction with the middle and posterior third. Diastatic or sutural fractures in which separation of the sutures occur only in young persons, due to blow on head with blunt weapon.

They observed that within 3 minutes, the circulating blood could be diluted by as much as 72%, and this massive increase in blood volume leads to bursting of the red blood cells with coincident liberation of potassium (a potent myocardial toxin). This causes increase in the plasma potassium with corresponding reduction in the sodium. In consequence of this electrolyte imbalance, hea suffers a 'serious biochemical insult' as remarked by Donald. Due to this insult to the hea, ventricular fibrillation sets in. Although the hea may continue to beat feebly for several minutes, the severe cerebral anoxia thus produced forms the immediate cause of death Ref : Krishnan vij Textbook of Forensic medicine and Toxicology 5th edtion ; pg no - 136"

In virgin rupture (tears) of hymen due to sudden tretching occurs in posterior half of membrane usually at the sides (i.e. posterolaterally) in 4 or 8'O clock or 5 or 7'O clock position, or in the midline of hymen (6'O clock position). With first intercourse tears usually occur in posterior midline because the hymen lies suspended across a potential space here, whereas anteriorly periurethral tissues buttress the hymen. More than 2 tears are unusual, Semilunar hymen often ruptures on both sides. Annular hymen which nearly closes up the vaginal orifice may suffer several hymenal lacerations indicate first sexual intercourse. One deep 'V shaped cleft/tear at 6' 0 clock or a number of clefts usually in posterior haft hymen membrane indicate passage of any object through hyme orifice which is larger its original opening.' In prepubeal children posterior tear may involve fourchette producing a deep U shaped defect. Fourchette is torn, fossa navicularis disappear and posterior commissure may be ruptured. The latter injury usually does not occur in consenting sexual intercourse unless there is much dispropoion between the male and female pas."

Krait is the most common poisonous snake in india. These have minimal reaction locally, but produce strong neurotoxicity. They act on motor nerve cells, resembling poisoning with curare. There is weakness of legs and face. Muscle paralysis occurs in following order :- mouth (first) followed by throat and finally respiratory muscles. Cobra venom also produces convulsions (krait venom produces only paralysis). B. Vasculotoxic (hematotoxic) It includes vipers. Viper venom contains hemolysins and thromboplasin which cause widspread endothelial damage and hemolysis. Locally at the site of bite, there is severe oozing of blood. There may be coagulation abnormalities with death due to hemorrhagic shock. Hematuria and hemoglobinuria occurs due to hemolysis. C. Myotoxic (musculotoxic) These are sea snakes. Their venom produces generalized muscle pain, weakness, followed by polymyositis,myoglobinuria, hyperkalemia and increased muscle enzymes. Finally there is respiratory and renal failure."

TESTS FOR DETERMINING ABO GROUPING IN BLOOD STAINS : (1) TUBE METHOD : A drop of washed suspension of red cells is added to equal volumes of each of the antisera of A, B and 0 in separate tubes. The blood group can be identified when agglutination is seen by naked eye or microscope in the tubes. (2) Tile Method: A porcelian tile is used instead of tubes. (3) ABSORPTION -INHIBITION METHOD : The sample and antisera are allowed to react with each other for a longer period. ( 4) MIXED AGGLUTINATION TEST : The sample piece of stained cloth is cut into pieces of 2 to 3 mm and the fibres are separated and added to tubes along with antisera of A, B, 0 types. The group can be known by the antisera which clumped to the cloth fibres. (5) ABSORPTION-ELUTION TECHNIQUE: Test is similar to mixed agglutination, but the clumps are seen on the walls of the test tube and not on fibres. This test can be used for body tissues also. Blood stains can be typed for the presence of ABO agglutinogens by absorption-elution, absorption- inhibition, mixed agglutination or ELISA method, or for agglutinins by the Lattes crust method.

    "explanation": "Lightening tends to cause injury by pushing the compressed air before the current but not in front of the current as mentioned in the option. This effect is called the 'sledge hammer blow' effect of Lightening as described by Spencer. Spencer formulated four mechanisms \"Lightning\" by which it does its effects on humans and the surroundings. They are: 1. Direct effect from the high voltage electric current discharge that passes to the eah. 2. Surface flash burning effect from the super heated air discharge. 3. The air is expanded and repelled - the mechanical effect brought about from the force of displaced air is exhibited around the flash. 4. Compression effect due to the movement of air pushed before the current - Sledge hammer blow effect. Ref: The Essentials of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology By Dr. K. S.

It is a process through which one merely extends the dying process and not life per se. Consequently, patients have a prolonged and slow death, frequently accompanied by suffering, pain and anguish. When one invests in healing a patient who has no chance of cure, s/he is actually undermining the person's dignity. Advanced measures and their limits should be assessed to benefit the patient and not to hold science as an end in itself.* Euthanasia is currently conceptualized as an action that aims to end the life of a human being taking into account humanistic considerations in relation to the person or society; it is unethical and illegal in Brazil. Nurses should be aware of their ethical code, which clearly prohibits (article 29): \"Promoting euthanasia or participating in practice intended to facilitate a patient's death\".* Orthotanasia refers to the art of promoting a humane and correct death, not subjecting patients to misthanasia or dysthanasia and not abbreviating death either, that is, subjecting them to euthanasia. Its great challenge is to enable terminal patients to keep their dignity, where there is a commitment to the well being of patients in the final phase of a disease."

It can either be a subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Brain injuries Coup injury is defined as the injury of skull and/or brain at the site of impact, e.g. a blow on forehead, resulting in fracture of frontal bone and injury or haemorrhage in frontal lobe. Contre coup injury is defined as an injury to the skull or brain, on opposite (contralateral) side of the area of impact. Cerebral concussion (stunning) occurs due to head trauma and is characterized by gross physiological disturbance of brain without any anatomical damage. There is sudden loss of consciousness with a tendency to spontaneous recovery. The condition is more severe when damage is caused to the moving head (decceleration injury) than when it results from blows to skull. Recovery from concussion is often followed by retrograde amnesia."

This can be caused by chronic mercury exposure in any form usually in children.* The onset is insidious with anorexia, insomnia, sweating, skin rash and photophobia.* Hands and feet become puffy, pinkish, painful, paraesthetic with peeling of skin.* Teeth may be shed.* Metallic mercury (para or quick silver) is not poisonous on ingestion, as it is not absorbed. But its vapours are poisonous. Mercuric compounds being soluble are more poisonous than mercurous compounds. Mercuric chloride (HgCl2), also called corrosive sublimate or perchloride of mercury, is most poisons salt of mercury.* Acute poisoning presents with syncope, convulsions general instability and nephrotoxicity (proximal tubular). The mouth, tongue and fauces become corroded and appears grayish white.* Signs and symptoms of chronic mercury poisoning are :1) Excessive salivation, metallic taste, loosening of teeth, and blue black lining on gums (similar to lead poisoning).2) Diphtheria like membranous colitis and dysentery.3) Anorexia, insomnia, sweating, nause, irritability and photophobia.4) Special features are :i) Mercuria lentis: Brownish deposition of mercury on anterior lens capsule.ii) Tremors : There are moderately coarse, intentional tremors starting in fingers and hands, and legs.

    ],
    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Seen on dependent parts of body * Postmortem staining refers to discoloration of skin and internal organs after death due to accumulation of fluid blood in toneless capillaries and small veins of dependent part of the body.* As dead body behaves like an inert substance, therefore there is gravitational flow of blood to the dependent parts of body, causing stagnation of blood in toneless capillaries and small veins, causing bluish purple staining of these parts.* Characteristic features of postmortem staining are:1) It does not appear elevated above the surface but has sharply defined (usually horizontal) margins.2) It is an early sign of death. It starts at about 1 hour, becomes a series of mottled patches within 1-3 hours and these pathces increase in size to coalesce in about 3-6 hours. After 6-12 hours, lividity is fully developed and fixed (unchangeable), i.e. primary lividity. It ends when putrification sets in. Fixation of lividity is due to stagnation of blood in distended capillaries and venules (not due to coagulation of blood).3) If the position of body is changed, after development of lividity but before it becomes fixed, these patches will disappear and fresh ones will develop in the new dependent areas (secondary lividity), but lividity to a slight degree will remain in the original area due to staining of tissue by hemolysis (complete).4) Normally the staining is at first bluish-pink and afterwards bluish purple.In severe anemia, and death from haemorrhage, the staining is very faint. In deaths from asphyxia, where blood is deoxygenated and may not readily coagulate, the staining is intensely developed and purple in colour. In conditions where blood coagulates quickly eg. in lobar pneumonia lividity is less abvious.5) It is seen on dependent parts of the body, therefore site depends upon position of body after death:i) In supine: On posterior dependent portion of body. But not seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks and back of calves due to contact flattening, i.e. toneless capillaries are compressed and occluded by weight and pressure of body.ii) In hanging: Dependent lower half of both lower limb and upper limb (i.e. lower half of leg with feet and lower half of forearm with hands), and external genitalia.iii) In drowning: Head and upper half of body as head being the heaviest part becomes the dependent part. It does not develop in running water due to constantly changing position of the body.6) No lividity is seen on pressure points of body, i.e. contact pallor, as pressure caused by weight of body causes compression of toneless vessels and prevent their filling with blood:i) In supine: No lividity is seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks, occipital area and calf ->> contact flattening.ii) Also no lividity occurs in parts tightly tied with belt, waist band or brassiere and the area is seen as stripes or bands called vibices."

    "label": "C",
    "explanation": "Ans. C: Travel expenses for witness In civil cases, a fee is tendered to cover the expenses to attend the cou when the summons is served. This is known as conduct money Conduct money It is money paid in some legal systems to a person under the compulsion of a summons to witness/ subpoena to pay for their expenses to attend in cou. It generally incorporates a daily rate for each day the witness must attend in cou (with a one-day minimum), plus a travel allowance to allow the witness to get to the place of the hearing. Generally, conduct money must be delivered with the summons for it to have legal effect. Witnesses are generally entitled to additional conduct money if their attendance is required on more days than anticipated. Moreover, witnesses who are required to make an overnight stay to attend in cou on more than one day are generally entitled to an allowance for accommodation and meals. The rates for travel, daily attendance, accommodation and meals are generally set under a cou tariff, and are fixed for all witnesses. A witness may not refuse to appear merely because they believe the conduct money is insufficient to make up for their lost wages or actual travel expenses. Witnesses may be paid more, but the additional cost cannot be claimed against the losing pay - only the tariff amount can be recovered. Occasionally, special witnesses, such as expes, may be entitled to receive conduct money under a higher tariff."

The methods used areGustafson's method : Useful only in persons older than 21 years of age, depending on the physiological changes in each of the dental tissues.1. Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel).2. Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent part of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis).3. Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, start from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis.4. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde).5. Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root start at apex and extend upward (may be pathological).6. Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria).Mile's method : Age can be known by changes of root transparency.C) Boyde' method : On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at birth (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination.D) Stack's method : Age of infant can be known from height and weight of erupting teeth."

These includea) Sadism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on ones partner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc.b) Lust murder: In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.c) Necrophagia: (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat): This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure.d) Masochism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, tortured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual partner.e) Necrophilia: In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants.f) Fetishism: A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm, eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc.g) Transvestism = Eonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interest, and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality.h) Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these parts with several fingers or whole hands (it is an offence when done in public).i) Exhibitionism (Sec 294IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine).j) Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom: Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman.k) Frotteurism: Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone.l) Undinism: In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex.m) Indecent assault (Sec 354 IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual part of either or is sexually favored. In such assaults, a man may try to kiss a woman, press or fondle with her breasts, touch or expose the genitalia or thighs, try to put a finger in her vagina, play with vulva.# A medical practitioner can be accused of indecent assault if he examines a female patient by stripping her clothes without her consent or even with her consent in the absence of a female attendant.# Such assaults are punishable under Sec 354 IPC, upto 2 years imprisonment and/or fine.n) Uranism: General term for perversion of the sexual instinct.o) Satyriasis: Incessant sexual desire.p) Priapism: Painful penile erection in absence of sexual desire."

Scab or crust is formed over exposed raw surface and most injuries heal without scar as they are superficial.o Age of abrasion can be calculated by following changes:-# Fresh:Reddish# 12-24 hours:Scab forms, which is red in colour# 2-3 days:Reddish brown Scab# 4-7 days:Abrasion starts healing (epithelization) from periphery# 7-10 days:Scab dries up and falls off# 10-12 days:Healing is complete (skin colour returns to normal)o Type of abrasion are:-1) Scratches (linear abrasion):# It is an abrasion with legnth but no significant width produced by a sharp object e.g., pin, needles, knife, thorn and nail etc.# Point scratch is a very superficial incision produced by a sharp or pointed object not sharp enough to incise but pointed enough to produce scratch.2) Grazes (Sliding abrasion/scraping abrasion/grinding abrasion):# It is the most common type of abrasion, produced when a broad surface of skin slides against rough surface, e.g., during vehicular accidents. Injury is due to friction. The surface of injury show irregular parallel lines, i.e., furrows or grooves.# A violent lateral graze, due to rubbing of skin (as in dragging) is known as brush burn (Gravel rash).# Friction burn (Scuff or brush abrasion) occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface or when the skin is covered by clothing. It is an extensive superficial, reddened excoriated area without bleeding and with little or no linear mark.3) Pressure abrasions (crushing or friction abrasions) :# Though it is called friction abrasion, it results from pressure of the object on the body with no or little friction (it is a misnomer).# It is caused by crushing of superficial epidermis due to inward directed movement of object at around 90deg to skin.# Example are ligature marks in hanging/strangulation, teeth bites and nail marks.4) Impact abrasion (Imprint or contact abrasion):# It is caused by impact (but not pressure) with a rough object, when the force is applied at or near 90deg to skin surface.# It is depressed below surface unless associated with contusion (bruise)."

    ],
    "label": "A",
    "explanation": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odorless, tasteless, and non irritating gas produced by the incomplete combustion of any carbon-containing material. CO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity 250 times that of oxygen, resulting in reduced oxyhemoglobin saturation and decreased blood oxygen-carrying capacity. CO may also directly inhibit cytochrome oxidase, fuher disrupting cellular function, and it is known to bind to myoglobin, possibly contributing to impaired myocardial contractility. Symptoms of intoxication are predominantly in organs with high oxygen consumption, such as the brain and hea. The majority of patients describe headache, dizziness, and nausea. Patients with coronary disease may experience angina or myocardial infarction. With more severe exposures, impaired thinking, syncope, coma, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and death may occur. Cerebral edema (swelling of the brain) is also a common result of severe carbon monoxide poisoning. Survivors of serious poisoning may experience numerous ove neurologic sequelae consistent with a hypoxic-ischemic insult, ranging from gross deficits such as parkinsonism and a persistent vegetative state to subtler personality and memory disorders. Cyanosis is not seen in CO poisoning. Ref: Olson K.R. (2012). Chapter 44. Carbon Monoxide. In K.R. Olson (Ed), Poisoning & Drug Overdose, 6e."

It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the environment in which blast occurs :-Air blast (most common) : Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other parts injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected.Under water blast (explosion under water) : Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured.Solid blast: Explosive is detonated near a rigid/solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal; fracture of legs and vertebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung."

    "explanation": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., Rule of nine Criminal responsibility of insane is judged by following rules : 1. Mc Naughten rule (legal test or right or wrong test) : It states that an accused person is not legally responsible, if it is clearly proved that at the time of commiting the crime, person was suffering from such a defect of reason from abnormality of mind that he didn't know the nature and quality of act he was doing or that what he was doing was wrong i.e. a person is not responsible if he is not of sound mind. It is accepted in india as law of criminal responsibility and is embodied in section 84 1PC as - \"nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind is incapable of knowing the nature of act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law\". 2. Doctrine of paial responsibility - If a person is suffering from some weakness or aberration of mind (though not completely insane), he is only paially responsible for his actions, e.g. obsession states or depressions. 3. Durhan rule- Accused is not responsible for the act, if his act resulted from mental disease or defect. 4. Currens rule- A person is not responsible if at the time of committing the crime, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct according to the requirements of law, as a result of his mental disease or defect. 5. American law institute test-Insane lacks the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to confirm to the requirements of law, therefore he is not responsible for crimes committed. 6. Norwegion system-No defendant considered insane or unconscious at the time of offence, may be punished"

He was found not guilty on grounds of insanity. The answers given by panel of 14 judges to house of lords to clarify the legal position (on 19 june 1843) as known as MC Naughten rule.# It states that an accused person is not legally responsible, if it is clearly proved that at the time of commiting the crime, person was suffering from such a defect of reason from abnormality of mind that he didn't know the nature and quality of act he was doing or that what he was doing was wrong i.e. a person is not responsible if he is not of sound mind.# It is accepted in india as law of criminal responsibility and is embodied in section 84 IPC as - \"nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind is incapable of knowing the nature of act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law\".# The primary defect is that the criteria for deciding insanity is purely intellectual (reason based). And there is no place for delusional beliefs, hallucinations, emotional and volitional factors and the ability of an individual to control the impulses. This is because the abnormality of mind (term used in this rule) is a legal and not a psychiatric concept and is concerned with the mind (i.e. reason, memory and understanding) not with the brain.# Clearly proved (term) means that the mental abnormality had a direct causal relation to the offence (i.e. it would not have occurred in absence of mental abnormality).# Crime consists of actus reus (i.e. guilty act) and mens rea (wrong intention). So if at the time of crime, the accused had the capacity to know that his act was wrong, he will be fully responsible, even if he was mentally ill, and unable to refrain from doing the act at that time.# If an accused commits a crime under the influence of delusion, he is j udged as if the delusionary facts were real. So if due to an insane delusion, a person kills a man in self defence (thinking that he is attempting to kill him or thinking that he is a wild animal) or as a part of job (thinking that he is a state executioner and has to execute the victim) he has no criminal responsibility and is exempt from punishment. But due to an insane delusion, if a person thinks that another person has caused a serious injury to his fortune and character and kills him, he becomes responsible as under the law no one can kill a person in revenge.2) Doctrine of partial responsbility# If a person is suffering from some weakness or aberration of mind (though not completely insane), he is only partially responsible for his actions, e.g. obsessional states or depressions.3) Durban rule# Accused is not responsible for the act, if his act resulted from mental disease or defect.4) Currens rule# A person is not responsible if at the time of committing the crime, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct according to the requirments of law, as a result of his mental disease or defect.5) American law institute test# Insane lacks the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to confirm to the requirements of law, therefore he is not responsible for crimes committed.6) Norwegion system# No defendent considered insane or unconscious at the time of offence, may be punished."

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "inhibits cytochrome a oxidase Aluminium phosphide produces phosphine gas on coming in contact with moisture which inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (and not cytochrome a oxidase). Sub-endocardial infarction and esophageal strictures both have been described with ALP poisoning (Ref: various journals on web) Aluminium phosphide poisoning It is one of the most common causes of acute poisoning in India. Acute aluminium phosphide (Celphos) poisoning is an extremely lethal poisoning. The absence of a specific antidote results in very high moality and the key to treatment lies in rapid decontamination and institution of resuscitative measures. Aluminium phosphide (A1P) is one of the most commonly used grain fumigants because of its propeies which are considered to be near ideal; it is toxic to all stages of insects, highly potent, does not affect seed bility, is free from toxic residues. After ingestion of aluminium phosphide, phosphine gas is released in the stomach which after absorption into the circulation results in early signs and symptoms. AlP causes widespread organ damage due to cellular hypoxia as a consequence of non-competitive inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase of the mitochondria. Organs with the greatest oxygen requirements appear to be especially sensitive to phosphine, including the brain, kidneys, hea, and liver. The initial symptoms after ingestion are retrosternal burning, epigastric pain and vomiting which are soon followed by development of hypotension which is the cardinal feature. Other common features are restlessness, tachypnoea, oliguria or anuria, jaundice, impaired sensorium and cardiac arrhythmias. Several EKG abnormalities have been described. These have been attributed to focal myocardial necrosis and changes in action membrane potential as result of alteration in permeability of Na+, Mg++ and Ca+ ions Diagnosis A positive history of ingestion is the basis of diagnosis in most cases. The presence of typical clinical features, garlicky (or decaying fish) odour from the mouth and highly variable arrhythmias in a young patient with shock and no previous history of cardiac disease points towards aluminium phosphide poisoning. Confirmation can be done by the Silver Nitrate Test. In this test, 5 ml of gastric aspirate and 15 ml of water are put in a flask and the mouth of the flask is covered by filter paper impregnated with 0.1N silver nitrate. The flask is heated at 50 o C for 15 to 20 min. If phosphine is present the filter paper turns black. However the most specific and sensitive method for detecting the presence of P1-13 in blood/air is gas chromatography. (Vies Jansen A, Thrane KE. Gas chromatographic determination of PH3 in ambient air. Analysis 1978;103:1195-8.) Management The management continues to be unsatisfactory as there is no specific antidote and remains suppoive only. The most impoant factor for success is resuscitation of shock and institution of suppoive measures as soon as possible. To reduce the absorption of phosphine, gastric lavage with potassium permanganate (1:10,000) is done. Permanganate is used as it oxidizes PH3 to form non-toxic phosphate. This is followed by a slurry of activated charcoal (approximately 100 gin) given through a nasogastric tube. A cathaic (liquid paraffin) is given to accelerate the excretion of aluminium phosphide and phosphine. Antacids and proton pump blockers are added for symptomatic relief."

It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion.# The injuries depend on the enviornment in which blast occurs:-i) Air blast (most common):* Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to airfilled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury.* Other parts injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected.ii) Under water blast (explosion under water):* Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured.iii) Solid blast:* Explosive is detonated near a rigid/solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place.* The injuries are mostly skeletal; fracture of legs and vertebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung.2) Flame or hot gases# Burns or burning of body may occur.3) Flying missiles (debris)# Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations.4) Anoxia# Various gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO2"

So they are most useful in identifying make and model (class) of weapon. Features noted include1) Calibers and type.2) Number and width of lands and grooves.3) Direction and rate of twist of rifling.4) Pitch (angle of spiral) of rifling.o Secondary markings (individual or accidental characteristics/Bullet finger print):# Irregularities on the inner surface of barrel due to accidental manufacturing defects or sticking of particles of prior fired bullets (later is known as metallic fouling) also produce grooving (marking) on surface of bullet. These secondary individual (or accidental) markings are specific for that particular weapon and used to exclude it from all others (bullet fingerpringing). These are more pronounced on lead bullet (which may even sometimes carry weaving pattern of cloth) and jacketed bullet.o The bullet found in body or crime scene is called crime (exhibit) bullet. It is compared under microscope with test bullet fired from suspected weapon. Using same type and brand of ammunition, the suspected weapon is fired into a box filled with cotton waste (bullet traps), a sand bag, bag of rags, oiled saw, dust, blocks of ice, water tank (bullet recovery tank) or against white bloating paper."

    ],
    "label": "B",
    "explanation": "Ans is 'b' i.e. Imprint abrasion Real confusion in this question is between imprint abrasion and patterned bruising. In both imprint abrasion and patterned brusing there is mark or pattern of the object causing injury.* Abrasion is caused by friction and/or pressure between the skin and some rough object or surface. For abrasions to occur some movement along with pressure is essential between the object or instrument or weapon and the skin. Inabrasions superficial layers of skin are crushed and damaged.* Bruises or contusions are caused by blunt trauma resulting in rupture of small blood vessels which lead to effusion of blood in subcutaneous or subepithelial tissues. However skin is intact in most cases until associated withabrasions.* In an accident in which victim is overrun by vehicle, there will be movement and friction between the tyre and skin along with pressure by the tyre leading to imprint or patterned abrasion. There can be intradermal bruises also whichare usually associated with patterned objects. So the tyre mark will be primarily an imprint or patterned abrasion (tyre has a pattern because of ridges and grooves) associated with bruises too.Also know-Abrasions are of following types - 1. Scratches - a linear injury produced by a sharp object, such as a pin, thorn, nail or tip of any sharp weapon.2. Graze - An injury which is produced when a broad surface of skin slides or scraps against a rough surface. These are the most common type. Commonly seen in road accidents.Violent lateral (tangential) rubbing against a rough surface can produce abrasion known as 'brush burn' or 'gravel rash'.'Friction burn' can occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface.3. Patterned abrasions: In it pattern of the object causing injury is produced over the skin when the force is applied at right angle to the surface of the skin. Patterned abrasions are produced either by pressure of the object or by impactwith a rough object. The former is called pressure (crushing or friction) abrasion and the latter is known as impact (contact or imprint) abrasion. There can be associated bruising in the surrounding area. Examples are ligaturemark, nail and thumb mark, teeth bite marks, whip marks, radiator, grill or tyre marks in vehicular accidents and muzzle marks in gunshot injuries."

Judicial hanging causes fracture-dislocation usually at the level of 2nd and 3rd or 3rd and 4th cervical vertebrae. B/l fractures of either the pedicles or laminae of the arch of the 2nd, 3rd or 4th cervical vertebrae occur.In proper judicial hanging, there is rupture of the brain stem between the pons and the medulla.This results in instantaneous and irreversible loss of consciousness (d/t destruction of reticular formation) and in irreversible apnoea (d/t destruction of the respiratory centre).Death is instantaneous due to damage to spinal cord or brain stem though the heart may continue to beat for 15 to 20 minutes and muscle jerking may occur for quite some time."

Death is unusual and may occur d/t hea failure. 4. Heat stroke - (heat hyperpyrexia, sub stroke) - It is due to impairment of body's heat regulating mechanism caused by failure of cutaneous circulation & sweating, following prolonged exposure to hot, humid conditions. - The onset is usually sudden with sudden collapse and loss of consciousness. Predominant symptoms may also be seen (i.e. headache, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, mental confusion, muscle cramps, excessive thirst, excessive desire to micturate) - The skin is dry, hot and flushed with complete absence of sweating - Body temperature rises as high as 43degC (hence k/a hyperpyrexia) when body temp. rises above 42degC vasodilation occurs with decrease in blood volume leading to circulatory collapse and cardiac failure. - Delirium and convulsions may precede death. - Moality rate in this condition is relatively high. - Fatal period varies from few minutes to 3 days."

The classical example of this is seen in traffic accidents when tyre of a motor car passes over the skin leaving the pattern when the skin has been squeezed into the grooves of the rubber thread.- Pressure Abrasions (Crushing Abrasions / Imprint Abrasions):o When the impact is vertical to the skin surface, the epidermis gets crushed and pressure type of abrasions result and the imprint of the impacting object may be produced. These may be seen in manual strangulation (abrasions produced by fingernails) and in hanging, where weave of the ligature material may be reproduced."

    "label": "D",
    "explanation": "D i.e. Patient In case of malpractice, punishment is given by civil or criminal couQ (depending on type of negligence). Generally, the innocence of doctor is assumed and in cases where negligence is alleged, the plantiff (complainant, patient) has to establish the guilt. The patient is expected to prove that the defendant (doctor) was negligent; there fore the onus (responsibility) of proof lies on patient. But when the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor (ie thing speaks for itself) is applied such as in case of surgery on wrong patient / side / organ etc, the doctor will have to prove that what has happened is not due to his negligenceQ. This means onus of proof lies on patient in negligence (all civil & most criminal case) except in cases where doctrine of res ipsa loquitor appliesQ. Therapeutic misadventure (mischance / disaster / accident) is death or injury of a patient due to some unintentional act by doctor /nurse /hospitalQ during treatment (therapeutic), diagnosis (diagnostic) or experimental study. It provides defence against neglince because a doctor can't be held responsible for injuries resulting from adverse reaction of drug. However, the doctor must warn patient about possible side effects (eg death during surgery or transfusion). And ignorance of the possibility of reaction to drug prescribed to patient amounts to negligence (ie it is not 100% = absolute defence). At times it is not possible to explain every thing to the patient (who may be scared of procedure). Under such circumstances doctor can reveal the details to any one of close relatives of patient. This is called doctrine of therapeutic privilege. Doctrine of emergency says that doctor can provide the treatment without taking prior consent from a patient who is gravely sick, (critically ill), unconscious, or not able to understand the suggestion, or when mentally ill (IPC section 92). In emergency situation involving children, when their parents are not available, a/t doctrine of locoparentis, consent can be obtained from accompanying person (eg teacher or relative). On ceain occasions, despite all proper care given by doctor during treatment, the patient might suffer severe injuries or permanent deformity. This is k/a medical maloccurance, inevitable act or Act of God. If doctor proves this before cou, it will be an absolute defence against malpractice. Free (charity) treatment of patient does not give doctor immunity (defence) against negligenceQ. Whereas judgemental (diagnostic) error, therapeutic misadventure, medical maloccurance, calculated risk doctrine, contributory negligence (on pa of patient), product liability, and res judicata (complain already tried once in cou) provide defenses to a doctor against charges of negligence. Law does not consider doctrine of contributory negligence & consent in charges of criminal negligence; whereas these provide defence in civil negligence."
